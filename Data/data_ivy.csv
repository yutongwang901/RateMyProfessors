0,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,EN90,5.0,2.0,He is a great guy  a real character with some real good experiences.
1,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0930A,5.0,2.0,"PROFESSOR HAZELTINE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT BROWN BY FAR. I HAVE TAKEN 3 CLASSES WITH HIM AND HE TRULY IS INSPIRATIONAL. GENUINELY A GREAT PERSON, HE REALLY CARES ABOUT HIS STUDENTS AND HIS DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN. HE HAS BEEN A MENTOR TO ME. HE ORIGINALLY RETIRED IN 1997, AND SINCE THEN HAS COME BACK TO TEACH AT BROWN 21 YRS IN A ROW. HE IS THE BEST."
2,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0090,5.0,2.0,Living Legend
3,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0090,4.0,1.0,"Somehow makes the time for each student in a giant lecture class of 500+ students. You get out of the class what you put into it. Unlike most Brown students, I would not say it's a ""must-take."" But if you have room for it, it's a fun extra class."
4,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0090,5.0,1.0,Great professor !
5,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,B,4.5,1.0,Epic professor.
6,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN9,3.5,3.0,"SO AMAZING. I loved this class. I learned a lot, and Prof Hazeltine is awesome. He cares about his students."
7,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN90,5.0,1.0,"The ""man"". nuff' said."
8,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN900,5.0,1.0,Best professor I've ever had at Brown. Incredibly smart and dedicated to teaching and helping every student in his classes.
9,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0090,4.0,1.0,"Easy and interesting. Go to class as often as possible, especially for the guest speakers."
10,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,EN90,5.0,1.0,Awesome.
11,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,EN09,5.0,1.0,Outstanding!
12,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,EN90,4.5,2.0,"He is by far my most beloved professor, cross my heart. His ability to remember names/faces is uncanny. I love that he came to so many of the Brown Women's Basketball games. He has taught in Africa after being a professor for many, many years. He's my hero! I can't say enough. Oh, his classes are also great!"
13,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGIN9,5.0,1.0,SUCH A RAD TEACHER!
14,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGIN9,4.5,2.0,Amazing professor. Well connected and really knows what he's talking about.
15,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,ENGIN9,5.0,1.0,awesome
16,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,EN9,5.0,1.0,So happy I took the class.  Hazeltine is great.
18,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,EN90,5.0,3.0,The best professor at brown
19,29716,Barrett,Hazeltine,Brown University,Engineering,EN990,5.0,1.0,"He is charming, a genius, helpful and always available."
21,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0360,2.0,5.0,Very difficult. Does not test what is learned in class but will always make tears much harder than anything ever taught. Do not take this class unless you absolutely must for a pre-professional track or concentration requirement.
22,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0350,5.0,3.0,Stan Zimmt. Period. I haven't had another instructor as devoted or passionate about the subject as he is. Super available outside of class and offers great advice to struggling students.
23,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0330,5.0,5.0,"BRILLIANT guy, amazing professor. His class is a LOT harder than the other CHEM 330 classes but an inordinate amount of ppl showed up for his lectures anyway because he was such a fantastic professor. Tests were so difficult though"
24,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0350,5.0,4.0,I was fortunate to have Professor Zimmt for 330 and 350. He is the absolute best! I didn't like chemistry one bit prior to this but he really finds a way to spread his passion for the subject by constantly adding humor to lectures and relating the applications of chemistry to other fields. He offered so many office hours and was very available.
25,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0350,5.0,3.0,"I took two classes with Zimmt (as we call him): CHEM0330 (Gen Chem) last fall and CHEM0350 (Organic Chemistry 1) now in the Spring. As someone who hated chemistry, I can say I was very lucky to have him as my very first Chemistry professor here at Brown. Love his classes."
26,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0360,5.0,4.0,"My, oh my! One of (if not the best) chem professors I've had in my undergraduate experience at Brown. Makes you work hard, but the class was really rewarding and his notes were phenomenal!"
27,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0360,4.5,4.0,"Great, clear, thorough chemistry lecturer, but expects a lot, can sometimes move quickly"
28,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0360,5.0,3.0,Jazziest chem teacher ever!
29,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0350,4.5,4.0,"He's an amazing professor: extremely engaged and connected to his students. He willingly answers every question regardless of its stupidity. I have never regretted going to class even though it's a 9am. He makes everything from resonance to ""backside attacks"" Substitution reactions interesting."
30,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM0350,5.0,3.0,Great Prof. He's a cook and makes the subject even more enjoyable.
31,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CHEM1450,5.0,4.0,Zimmt is great!
32,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH33,5.0,3.0,"Amazing Professor. One of the few professors that keeps you interested and attentive in class considering the class is at 9 o clock and its organic chemistry. 
 Simplifies things.. Definitely need to take tons of notes in this class"
33,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH35,3.0,4.0,"Zimmt is a clear lecturer but is not funny at all. Not only are his jokes the corniest things I've ever heard, but when he makes fun of people for asking questions then no one does anymore."
34,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH0035,5.0,1.0,ALWAYS take orgo with Zimmt. He makes the material half as difficult.
35,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH35,5.0,4.0,AMAZING!!! ONE OF THE BEST!!!!
36,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH35,5.0,4.0,Very nice guy.
37,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH35,5.0,4.0,"Definitely the best prof. I've ever had in my life. Amazing teacher, wonderful person. Obnoxiously sarcastic for people who can't deal with sarcasm - but great humor for people who can. Love this class, and don't want it to end."
38,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH35,5.0,5.0,"Zimmt is a great professor.  He is 1 of the 4 people in the world who is enthusiastic abt organic chemistry.  This makes lectures a little less painful.  He encourages questions in lecture which is nice.  Although he can come across as cocky, he truly cares about students' understanding.  &amp; he's hot"
39,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH35,3.5,4.0,"By far the most overrated professor I know about here at Brown.  Gets his jollies by making Orgo kids feel stupid - just ask him a question and see what answer you get.  May jump around a lot in lecture, but makes a big, confusing deal out of concepts that are pretty straightforward.  Go with SETO!!"
40,39579,Matthew,Zimmt,Brown University,Science,CH0035,3.5,5.0,"Great at explaining things and giving nice ways to remember them.  But he can definitely be a jerk and annoyingly ""funny"".  If you have to learn orgo, he at least makes it relatively easier.  Awful exams... likes people to flunk.  But this goes for all the orgo profs."
41,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,ANTH4045,3.0,2.0,"I took anth of mideast, first day beeman suggested reading orientalism by edward said and we watched a documentary on said. Turns out, beeman is one of the biggest orientalist ever, this is easily observable throughout his course. Also, spent two weeks talking about Tezeyah and only two hours about conflicts Iraq and Palestine, pointless bs"
42,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN0101,1.0,1.0,inexplicably mean and ill-tempered.
44,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN0115,5.0,5.0,"Professor Beeman's course on the Middle East was one of the best I have ever taken. I learned so much! I was utterly ignorant of the region, and now I feel so much more knowledgable. I read the newspapers these days and suddenly this light goes off--I really understand these events in depth--even better than the reporters sometimes. Great professor"
46,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN80,4.5,1.0,"Awesome professor! However, make sure you take detailed notes and ask questions before exams!"
47,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN115,5.0,5.0,"Best course ever on the Middle East. I went to Cairo after taking this course, and felt totally prepared for the experience."
48,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN80,5.0,5.0,"This course on language and culture was one of the best I took at Brown. I learned so much, and it was sooo interesting. I looked forward to every class"
49,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN115,5.0,5.0,Great class on Middle East.
50,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN115,5.0,5.0,Unbelievably great Middle East course. Don't miss this. He is one of the world's great experts.
51,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN118,5.0,5.0,"I am in Japan now, and I can't believe how much I learned in Professor Beeman's class. I feel at home in this very exotic land, and I knew absolutely zilch before I took the class. Don't miss this professor. He is great."
52,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN80,5.0,4.0,A great professor! Don't miss the chance to take a class with him
53,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN115,5.0,4.0,"I am so looking forward to taking another class from Prof. Beeman, who has beeen on leave this year. I signed up for two classes with him next year. He is great!"
54,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,LINGUISTIC,4.0,2.0,"Great class, interesting professor. I took this class a long time ago and still remember a lot from it. Good with examples. Lots of leeway with project topics and formats. I recently went back and looked at my projects and found them interesting, which is more than I can say for most assignments."
55,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,TA128MU134,5.0,4.0,"This is a workshop in Music Theatre. Beeman is a professional opera singer in addition to everything else he does. He knows opera and musicals cold. He helped me so much to overcome nervousness on stage. When I started, I couldn't get up in front of people and audition. At the end I felt confident."
56,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN115,5.0,5.0,"I hoped to take a course from Professor Beeman this semester, but he is on leave. Thanks for AN115--it was a great intro to the Middle East. I know more than my parents because of this class."
57,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN80,5.0,5.0,"This class helped me in every other class I took at Brown. It was so interesting. It covered human (and even animal) language in all ways, and had lots of fun projects. There was a lot of challenge, but Beeman made everything. I loved his informal lectures--deceptively full of content."
58,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN80,5.0,5.0,"Professor Beeman gave me my career. I am now in graduate school, and he prepared me for everything I am doing now. I owe him my success (and my current advisor told me he wrote a fantastic recommendation for me). He is a master teacher. You will be lucky to take a class from him."
59,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN115,5.0,5.0,"Professor Beeman is internationally recognized for his expertise on Middle Eastern Affairs, so it was amazing to be in his class. I learned an incredible amount. He was on NPR and TV while we had our class, and my parents were impressed."
60,15394,William,Beeman,Brown University,Anthropology,AN118,5.0,4.0,Great class on Japan. Great movies. I learned a lot.
62,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1150,5.0,4.0,A fantastic lecturer who really cares about what he teaches.
63,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1150,1.0,3.0,"Great class material and subject matter, but Tomasi is very flaky and hard to get a hold of outside of class. Doesn't answer emails. This class was team-taught by postdocs, most of whom were great."
64,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0110,3.0,4.0,"As I've said, a stunning lecturer. His time, however, is limited, it seems more limited than the other Professors at Brown. I think he's stretched too thinly, which limits the returns students could get from his class."
65,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0110,3.0,4.0,An extravangantly charismatic lecturer.
66,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0110,4.0,2.0,"Tomasi's class was the****.  Lectures were brilliant - seriously, you won't want to miss any - and seeing his mind work is just fascinating.  He definitely is not at all afraid to shoot down someone's comment if it doesn't make sense.  My only gripe is that as an advisor he's really flaky and not too helpful.  Still, best class I've had so far."
67,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0110,4.5,3.0,"Tomasi is witty, engaging, and brilliant. At first I was very intimidated by him, but his class turned out to be my favorite one. My only minor complaint is that he allowed the same few people to always dominate class discussions."
68,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,4.5,3.0,"Great lectures.  You have to rely on the T.A.'s more cus the class is HUGE, but he's a great professor (although kinda hard to get a hold of)..."
69,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS50,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love this man.   He's engaging, funny, brilliant... amazing!"
70,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,2.0,1.0,"He is a fine lecturer (although he just repeats the material, adding nothing new) but he is COMPLETELY unhelpful. He is NEVER available at his office hours, doesn't respond to email and is very flaky."
71,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,5.0,3.0,He is fun to watch. A great mind.
72,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,5.0,2.0,Awesome
73,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,5.0,3.0,Great Lecturer.
74,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,5.0,3.0,Tomasi is awesome.
75,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,4.0,4.0,"brilliant lecturer, but very down to earth (even shy) in person.    PS11 is the best class at Brown."
76,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,3.5,2.0,"Pretentious.  A good prof, but cut the acting.  Also, good luck finding him outside of lecture."
77,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS0011,4.0,4.0,"Tomasi was a good teacher, but I think he would have been better in a smaller class setting as opposed to a HUGE lecture hall."
78,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS0011,4.0,2.0,He is the reason i am a poli sci major
79,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,4.5,4.0,very engaging and enthusiastic professor; challenging and thought-provoking material
80,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS011,3.5,3.0,Good Professor
81,40308,John,Tomasi,Brown University,Political Science,PS11,4.0,4.0,overall good guy
82,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,1.0,5.0,"Probably one of the most traumatizing experiences for Brown students is this Principles of Economics class, alot fail, don't take in fall. It's all built on her tricking you into believing you don't know the course material, you could understand it perfectly and fail all midterms and exams. Also, the Professor really is sneaky she trynna play you."
83,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,3.0,4.0,3 midterms are literally 3 weeks apart and the grading is very hard because of the MC break down. Miss one MC and you are already down to an A-. The wordings on the test is not clear sometimes and thus would throw you off.
84,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC0011,2.0,4.0,Sometimes tested us on supplemental information we didn't learn in class. Used confusing wording on tests to throw off the curve. Awful professor.
85,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,4.0,3.0,"Its a good class and if you study you will def get a good grade. Professor Friedberg tends to digress in the lecture, and doesn't cover all the material but almost always refers back to the book. The homework and the tests are way harder than the questions and material in the book. However, you learn a lot and I would take it again."
86,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON,5.0,4.0,Great professor ! Loved her class and would totally recommend it to other people.; I would just say that it's time consuming if you're not interested in the topic. I personally enjoyed it and had fun all throughout.
87,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,3.0,5.0,"The professor's lectures are interesting but often drift off into discussion about her liberal political ideology. The tests focus more on tricking you rather than your understanding of the concepts. The exams are difficult but you will leave with a strong grasp of economic concepts. Overall, she is an average professor. Be ready to be challenged."
88,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,3.0,3.0,"Econ0110 is a great background regardless of your concentration, and Friedberg does a great job of keeping lectures fun and engaging. She is not easily accessible, but then again it is a 500 person class and TAs are available. My one complaint was that the tests are tricky and the problem sets don't help out. You really just have to use old tests."
89,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,3.0,2.0,"AWESOME CLASS. Really changes the way you think about the world. If you don't want to go to class you don't have to, because the lectures stick to the book pretty closely (and its at 9am) but Friedberg makes them pretty personal and engaging (although i dozed off once or twice) Highly recomended."
90,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,4.5,3.0,Good Professor- clear and interesting. Made 500 person lectures seem somewhat personal.
91,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON0110,1.0,5.0,"I can't believe anyone would consider this a decent teacher. PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!  she is awful however if your liberal you'll at least hear something that you can relate to but I wish she, and everyone else like her, would keep their stupid liberal opions to themsleves and just teach, not trick kids."
92,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC11,4.5,1.0,Very good instructor. Lectures clear.
93,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.5,1.0,This woman does not teach economics. Instead she uses each class to propagandize ultra-liberal nonsense to a largely receptive audience. I would suggest that she go get some life experience before returning to teach.
94,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECONECON,1.0,5.0,"She is a terrible teacher, she doesn't go over any of the material on the test and words the questions in a way where you cannot understand what she is saying.  The TAs for the class are just as useless as she is."
95,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,ECON11,2.5,3.0,"not bad, pretty clear, tests similar to whats been talked about in class. overral not a very hard class if u got to lecture and read the book"
96,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC11,3.5,1.0,Just ok - not very interesting and a let down after serrano
97,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC11,5.0,3.0,"Her lectures are clear, simple and very engaging. She is an excellent professor."
98,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC162,4.5,3.0,Pretty good.
99,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC162,4.5,3.0,Really clear. Makes everything simple.
100,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC162,5.0,1.0,Great lectures!
101,29702,Rachel,Friedberg,Brown University,Economics,EC162,4.5,3.0,great class for econ kids...i loved it
103,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,5.0,4.0,"she is incredible. hard, but incredible. i want to be her when im older. she knows her sh!t!"
104,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,3.5,4.0,"Amazing lecturer.  She brings enthusiasm and passion to politics that is pretty contagious.  Contrary to what people said, class is not hardundoable by any means, but its definitely not an easy A and you will have to work for it.  Go to office hours, she's much nicer and less intimidating there.  And start the papers and test studying early.  "
105,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,4.0,4.0,"SHE'S AWESOME! WHAT A ROCKSTAR! She works you hard because she genuinely believes that we are the future of American politics and we need to know our stuff, so people should lay off the criticisms. Fantastic lectures, interesting readings, and she really keeps the class connected to current events. Hard tests, fun essays, 100% percent worth it."
106,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,4.5,4.0,"She's a strict grader, yes, but her lectures are incredible and she holds consistent office hours."
107,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,4.0,5.0,"I learned so much from her! she gives great lectures. however, she's also pretty scary. woman's got claws."
108,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,3.0,5.0,"she's incredible. like, i want to be this woman when i grow up. but don't take this class unless you have to or can take it s/nc. i studied like a maniac--there's no other choice. you also are screwed if you think you can skip lecture and pass. if you want to learn a lot and don't mind being antisocial for the semester,"
109,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,2.5,5.0,"If you go to Brown, this is a professor you should avoid at all costs.  If you're interested in one of her classes or they are required for you, wait until someone else is teaching the class.  She is scary, intimidating, entitled, and constantly gives off the impression that she wants everyone to fail.  Seriously...STAY AWAY!!!"
110,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,2.5,5.0,"Crazy hard class, crazy scary prof. Wait until another prof teaches this class if you need it for the concentration."
111,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,2.0,5.0,"She feeds my enthusiasm for the subject and I love attending lecture. But there's no reason to teach through intimidation. It's nearly impossible to break down her harsh exterior, even at office hours. I put in SO much time for this class, and still do mediocre. I don't regret taking it, but I wish it weren't so incredibly difficult for no reason!"
112,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0010,3.5,3.0,Tough classes but well worth the struggle. She made me fall more in love with PoliSci.
113,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1130,4.5,5.0,I think she is one of the best professors at brown. If you take her class s/nc you will have a great time because you learn a lot without having to worry about grades.
114,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1130,5.0,4.0,Schiller is the bomb dot com
115,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1130,5.0,5.0,"This professor was a godsend.  She is the kind of professor a student dreams of having when he/she goes off to college.  The FYS was so substantive and her grading really helps the student's writing improve.  American Presidency was the most interesting lecture class I have ever attended.  She's tough, but her classes are definitely worth it."
116,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1130,4.0,3.0,"Phenomenal class, everyone should take ""The American Presidency.""  Schiller is an amazing professor."
117,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1130,2.5,5.0,"Repeat verbatim everything Prof. Schiller says in class, and memorize the resume of every politician or staffer who has served in the US Government during the latter half of the 20th century and you'll have a decent shot at passing this class."
118,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,POLS001,4.0,5.0,"She's an excellent teacher and lecturer, but the tests are very difficult. Her expectations are also unrealistic. On one test, the highest grade was a low C, so she assumed that none of us had studied. Make sure to take her clesses S/NC. You'll still have to work to pass."
119,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,PS10,2.5,5.0,"She is definitely smart, but her expections of students are absurd and just frustrate them rather than help them learn.  The class felt designed to torture rather than test its students.  Its standards were arbitrary at best and blatantly unfair at worst."
120,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,PS182,2.0,4.0,"Good in a lecture format, horrible in a discussion format."
121,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,PS110,5.0,3.0,Class was really fantastic. take it!
122,179559,Wendy,Schiller,Brown University,Political Science,PS0110,5.0,4.0,"She is an incredible Professor!  However, the class is time consuming."
124,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0220,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class. The professor is hilarious, nice, and thoughtful. He is inclusive and respects everyone. He gets super deep into the center of what is wrong with our country, but he loved to randomly choose people to speak about the reading during class which can be a little overwhelming. Otherwise, amazing."
125,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,POLS0220,4.0,3.0,I loved lecture. But the class is overrated -- don't feel like it's Brown-must. A ton of reading and weirdly specific multiple choice test questions that don't test knowledge but rather memorization of random facts. But a great professor to get to know and fun paper.
126,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,3.5,3.0,"Good professor and funny guy, but over-rated. His course is good, but not a MUST by any means. People rave about his Civil Rights Lecture, which is good, but nothing remarkable. For truly incredible insight on race relations, I would suggest a history course with Vorenberg."
127,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS0022,5.0,3.0,he uses stories well
128,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,5.0,3.0,"EXCELLENT teacher.  The best, most engaging lecturer.  His class is always a highlight of my day.  He's very informative and offers totally different ways of thinking about urban politics.  Friends of mine frequently attend his lectures just for fun.  He's that good."
129,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,4.0,3.0,"Some of the best lectures I've ever attended -- I've heard he can be pretty arrogant, but the lectures are worth it"
130,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,4.0,1.0,he is motivating and interesting but TA's grade the papers you write.
131,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,3.5,3.0,"Overrated, as stated. I still can't believe he taught his book, though my mom was impressed. He's very impressed with himself, too. Don't remember what we were supposed to be learning, but I did learn about pomposity. Too much peer pressure to take this class."
132,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,2.5,3.0,"very clear, which is problematic because clarity does not equal substance. overrated, highly."
133,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,2.0,1.0,"Listening to a pompus wealthy professor talk about social injustice...while making his undergraduates increase his book sales was almost ironic.  Morone is incredibly overrated...he has alot to say, but nothing to offer.  No substance whatsoever."
134,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,2.0,1.0,"Without a doubt, the most overrated professor--ever."
135,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22PS182,2.0,1.0,"Overrated and full of himself. PS22 was good, but his seminar is overblown and consists mainly of his own thoughts and writing with no room for outside thought or interpretation."
136,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,5.0,1.0,"Best class I've taken with the best lecturer at Brown.  makes a class of 500 students seem like a seminar.  Brilliant lectures, well organized, very clear.  I got so much out of this course and loved it.  Plus hes hilarious and passionate."
137,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,1.0,3.0,All form and no substance.  Most overrated professor at Brown.
138,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,4.5,2.0,amazing lecturer. very entertaining.
139,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS200,5.0,3.0,A living embodiment of the ideal prof.
140,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,US187,5.0,4.0,Brilliant
141,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS0022,4.5,3.0,Morone is vibrant and entertaining.  He is great.
142,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS22,5.0,2.0,"What an amazing guy!  The best professor at Brown!  I think he is wonderful, inspiring, thought-provoking and all-around awesome!!!  Oh and he donates the profits from the books' sales from ps22 to charity so don't try to catch him on that!!!"
143,153753,James,Morone,Brown University,Political Science,PS0022,5.0,3.0,best class i've taken at brown!
144,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS0701,4.5,4.0,Wonderful professor and a helpful person!
145,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS1800,5.0,2.0,Professor Hayden is the best!
146,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS8,2.5,5.0,"personality isn't what you think it'll be. i thought i'd learn a ton of relevant info, but hayden sucks the fun out of the topic."
147,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30,4.0,1.0,"Hayden's class to me was extremely informative, though I probably learned most from the book rather than the lectures.  In my opinion he spends somewhat too much time on psychoanalysis, and not enough time covering a thorough overview of the topic so much as a couple of independent theorists and some of their models."
148,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30PY133,4.5,3.0,"I loved both classes, though I prefer PY30. Warning: It is a fair amount of memorization and exams are based 1/2 on the reading and 1/2 on the lecture but once you get in2 the mindset that you have to memorize stuff from the book and thoroughly understand the important stuff he stresses in class you'll do great. His written 1/2 of the exam isn't as bad as the MC from the book."
149,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30ANDPY33,5.0,3.0,Hayden is super awesome and a GREAT professor!!!
151,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30,4.0,4.0,"Great class because the material was cool and Hayden teaches and lectures well, was way too early in the morning and the tests were a ****."
152,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY030,5.0,4.0,awesome
153,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30PY33,4.5,3.0,"Hayden is a god in the Psychology department. The class is legendary and I am amazed people gave him poor reviews. I am NOT a morning person, but I got my a** up to go to this class. The tests were sort of hard, but that just means you need to work hard. The material is fascinating."
154,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY3330,1.5,3.0,This profesor was very repetitive during lectures and had no variation in teachng style.  He also did not seem prepared to give good explanations for various terms and ideas.
155,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30,4.0,4.0,"very nice guy, thorough lectures. readings were hard, tests were VERY detailed. You really have to understand AND memorize. 9 am lecture is  hard, often people fell asleep. But DrHayden is amusing and approachable. I thought he was awesome and feel it's my lack of effort that made me not do well."
156,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30,2.0,4.0,Hayden created a very detailed and specific introductory course.  The reading was awful and the tests were hard because of the specificity of the questions.  He went through so many theorists that it was hard to keep them all straight in your head.  His lectures were also very boring and at 9 am.
157,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY33,5.0,3.0,he rocks
158,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30,1.0,2.0,"I had heard some great thigns about him, and I quickly realized why: His class is easy. Sure, it's interesting to listen to him sometimes, but I think most of us went to his class to take a nap. He's always busy and isn't very nice when you go to see him."
159,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30,2.0,4.0,one day i looked around in class and just about every other person was sleeping.  i think hayden is past his prime.  he loves to teach about totally irrelevant no-name psychologists who did one study in 1957 that was proved wrong in 1982.  just awful...
160,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30PY33,4.5,3.0,hayden made me want to become a psych concentrator. i'm doing an independent study with him next semester. he's awesome.
161,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY033,4.5,3.0,Dr. Hayden is a great guy with a solid perspective on abnormal psych...
162,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY33PY30,4.0,1.0,"goes on tangents a lot, but is funny in lectue and the tests are easy"
163,40481,Brian,Hayden,Brown University,Psychology,PY30PY33,4.0,3.0,"his classes aren't easy but they're really rewarding. he's made them easier this year. and he's really helpful 1 on 1, really concerned about how you're doing, and great to work with."
165,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,ARCH86,3.0,3.0,"Eloquent lecturer, great slideshows and use of media, but sometimes speaks too fast and doesn't explain things well Incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject; and yet the teaching style is one more suitable for a survey course I wished he could find a balance between presenting information and having more critical discussions."
166,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA0086,5.0,3.0,Great lecturer and very accessible outside of class. He tends to use iclickers and prioritizes paying attention to the lectures over taking notes. There is a textbook associated with the course but I never even touched it. Save your money and stick with the resources he gives you.
167,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA0085,5.0,3.0,Very intriguing clas
168,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HIAA0850,4.0,2.0,"Professor Neumann is an excellent lecturer and truly passionate about architecture, inspiring me and many other students to concentrate in Architectural Studies. He is friendly, well-spoken, and often makes cute jokes, and seems genuinely interested in his students. He is definitely approachable. Two of the best classes I've taken at Brown."
169,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA0086,5.0,3.0,Took an architectural studies class with this man my freshman year just for kicks and ended up concentrating in Architectural studies. I just kept taking his classes. Wonderful professor... wonderful man!
170,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HIAA0860,5.0,3.0,BEST CLASS EVER! BEST PROFESSOR EVER.
171,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA86,5.0,3.0,this man must be the greatest architecture professor in the world
172,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HIAA0850,5.0,4.0,Great lecturer! Don't miss a chance to take this class.
173,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,ARCH86,3.5,2.0,"great professor, i would take any course by him. however after my second course with him, i realized that his teaching style is a little superficial - you just memorize the info without thinking critically. 86 was much better than 70. as for tech savvy - i don't think so! he took 10 min every day to get his computer to work. he was always late"
174,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA0070,5.0,2.0,"Neumann is an incredible lecturer and his powerpoint presentations are top notch. He is kind, gentle and brilliant--He even convinced me to concentrate in Architectural Studies! I highly recommend taking one of his courses."
175,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA86,4.5,3.0,"great lectures. 
 rides a bike from time to time.
 savvy with the technology.
 super."
176,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA85,5.0,3.0,"knows his stuff, clear, organized, good lecturer.  he's great--no complaints here."
177,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA85,4.5,1.0,Dietrich is the man.
179,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA85,3.5,3.0,"Brilliant man, well spoken, engaging, good lectures, true passion for the subject.  Something about the quality of his voice and the way he looks, plus his accident made me melt during every lecture."
180,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA,5.0,4.0,Amazing class--one of my favorite lecturers in undergraduate and graduate study in architecture.  Watch out for his TA's though--the grading can be extremely inconsistent.
181,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,1920THCFILM,3.5,3.0,"he's good, don't get me wrong, but he's also way overrated."
182,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA85HA90,4.5,3.0,"Arrogant?  I get a more timid air from him, but confident at the same time...it's weird.   but certainly not arrogant...  I love neumann, he kept me totally engaged in the lectures and i looked forward to them unlike many of my other classes."
183,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,HA85,3.0,2.0,"He is erudite, lectures well and one can learn a lot from Professor Neuman, but at times he seems superficial and, yes, arrogant. Sometimes he explains things too fast."
184,160147,Dietrich,Neumann,Brown University,Architecture,ARCH,2.5,3.0,Nice but arrogant at times
186,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC0020,5.0,4.0,"Although this was a tough intro course (three 12 page papers that were graded pretty tough) it was really a great experience. I love Greg, he's such an adorable old man and even though ultimately I decided that Sociology might not be for me, I'm glad I got to have professor Elliott for a semester!"
187,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC0020,5.0,1.0,Professor Elliott is a really nice professor who clearly cares about his students.  He is very passionate about what he does and is always very friendly if you need to stop by during his office hours.
188,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC0020,2.5,5.0,His lectures were rather boring and too theoretical. Often I didn't realize I was confused until I went to write one of the three brutal 12-page essays.
189,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC1430,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Elliott is so articulate and passionate, and I always leave his lectures in introspection. He really cares about his students, too. As busy as he is with research and institutional obligations, he is so helpful during his office hours. He is  caring, approachable, and definitely one of my favorite people here at Brown. Take a class with him!"
190,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC0020,5.0,5.0,Professor Elliot is fantastic. He cares about his students and delivers impassioned lectures and you can apply his teachings to almost anything. It makes you a better observer of the world. You're missing out if you haven't taken a class with him.
191,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC1100,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Elliot is great! I took his statistics course, and although statistics is boring and difficult, he's always full of energy and loud enough to keep you awake and paying attention! Plus, he's always willing to give extra help during office hours and he's super friendly."
192,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC0200,4.0,4.0,"Elliot is a mix between your Santa Claus and Einstein. I loved his class, was never bored. Despite his high expectations for writing ability, I really felt like I got a lot out of taking this class."
193,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,INTROSOC,4.5,5.0,"Be ready for a lot of reading, a lot of writing, and tough grading. He's tough, but an awesome lecturer."
194,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SO30,4.5,4.0,Wonderful professor.  Elliott was intimidating at first but turned out completely approachable.  I truly enjoyed the class.
195,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC30,5.0,3.0,Fantastic guy. Wonderful orator. Brilliant professor. Take his Class.
196,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC110,4.5,5.0,"Has high demands of students, but presents statistics in a systematic and comprehensive way."
197,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SOC110,5.0,3.0,Prof. Elliot is very approachable if you have any questions just ask he'll answer happily. GO TO CLASS if you want to get a good grade because you'll need complete notes for the open book tests.
198,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,S0110,5.0,3.0,"Responsive, clear, open, friendly, helpful, silly, humorous, involved: Amazing"
199,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SO143,5.0,3.0,BRILLIANT.
200,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SO2,4.5,3.0,"This prof is amazing, i wish he werepart of my family. he was a sweet man in office hours. his lectures were clear and kept me interested.i really wanted to do well in the class b/c he was such a great guy. i wish we he lead section b/c my ta didn't help me understand the readings."
201,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SO30,3.5,3.0,"good course, great prof."
202,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SO110,1.0,5.0,This was by far the worse class and professor I have had in my four years at Brown.  He was hard to understand and often gave unclear examples.  Most of what was said was not relevant to test.  Without the book I would have been lost
203,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SO0110,4.5,3.0,"Prof Elliot was probably one of the most eloquent profs I've had. I love how when he lectuers, his voice can simply captivate you and show that he is passionate about what he is teaching."

205,161161,Gregory,Elliott,Brown University,Sociology,SO002,5.0,3.0,Professor Elliott was able to do what many professors cannot: he made lectures interesting.  He made all of his points clearly and made the class care about the material.
207,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0100,5.0,4.0,"I came to his class with no previous knowledge of art and leave with a clear idea of my skills and potential. I thank prof. Stupar for that; he is simply great. Everything has been said: great critic, available, knowledgeable... But ultimately, it's all up to you. You'll only get the best of him by asking doubts and putting effort in his class."
208,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA110,5.0,3.0,"Incredibly knowledgeable, very inspiring and an outstanding professor overall. He gives extremely constructive critiques and even changed my perspective on my work-in-progress(es). I thoroughly enjoyed Daniel's class and only wish he taught the higher level classes where he would actually be engaging and inspiring for students."
209,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA01,5.0,4.0,Daniel is undoubtedly one of my favorite professors at Brown. I have taken 2 classes with him because to me he is the perfect art teacher.  He is incredibly knowledgeable of materials and knows just how to push his students.  Everyone in my class felt very proud of their work and that was because of Daniel's brilliant teaching and guidance.
210,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA010,4.5,3.0,"Daniel's class was the defining feature of my first semester at Brown. I had always been interested in art, but had not felt as inspired or passionate as I did taking his classes. I am so grateful that I was able to have him as an instructor. If I do go into art after college, I'll have him to thank =)"
211,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0130,5.0,3.0,"Professor Stupar is by far the best art professor at Brown. He has an incredible knowledge of technical art making skills, gives creative projects, is invested in his students, and gives focused constructive criticism. What makes him stand out from the other VA professors is his high expectations for his students; he sees right through the BS"
212,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0100,5.0,1.0,Professor Stupar is my inspiration for art. He makes me appreciate art a lot more and feel passionate working n projects. He gives us a lot of space for imagination. He also encourages creativity. Professor Stupar always tries to help students as much as he can. Everyone loves him a lot. His teaching technique also helps me with my art skill a lot.
213,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA1,5.0,4.0,"Professor Stupar was by far the best art professor I've had. He gives students alot of freedom, but is also always available to talk in and out of class. He seems to be able to solve any problem and has a really wide range of knowledge about sculptural techniques.  Students respect him and he really cares about his students and their art."
214,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA13,5.0,3.0,"Professor Stupar is an amazing professor who really cares about his students. He is extremely knowledgeable and always had great suggestions, ideas, and inspiration for our projects. He motivated each and every one of us to succeed and taught me a lot about technical skills as well as attitudes with which to approach art-making/planning."
215,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0130,4.5,4.0,"Professor Stupar is a fantastic professor and who helps each individual student develop their own artistic sense, skill and style. Regardless of a student's level of ability Professor Stupar pushes and challenges them, while giving them lots of artistic freedom to explore their passions."
216,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0130,4.5,4.0,"Daniel is an extremely dedicated professor. He cares deeply about his students work and will go to great lengths to help them (buy them stuff, lend them his own tools, etc) but never to the degree where he would constrain their creativity.  His assignments are open-ended and play best to the curious and ambitious. He's also just downright cool."
217,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0130,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor, great course!  I learned more through his art class than through most of my liberal arts courses.  Highly recommend."
218,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISAVISA,4.5,3.0,"Daniel Stupar is incredible!! He is so laid back, I loves taking his classes, I learned an incredible amount about sculpture. I learned how to make molds, how to use plaster, how to weld! I am very sad that he will no longer be at my school."
219,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA130,5.0,3.0,Awesome in every way
220,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0110,5.0,3.0,"Daniel is one of the most remarkable teachers I've found at Brown. He is engaged in the material and the students. During crit, no matter the student or project, he was always able to find the redeeming qualities of a piece and the areas where the student could push their work. On a personal level, Daniel was one of my most influential teachers."
221,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VA10,5.0,3.0,"Has the strongest technical, conceptual, and communication skills of the department.  I cant imagine my Brown experience without Stupar."
222,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA11,4.5,4.0,"Daniel was the perfect professor, friend, and mentor for me as a freshman. He always came to class excited to teach and inspire and found positive and constructive things to say about your work without letting you off the hook too easily."
223,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,VISA0110,4.5,3.0,Wonderful teacher. This course was fundamental to my experience at Brown.
224,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,ISPISP,5.0,3.0,He is an excellent teacher. His knowledge of materials and techniques is vast; there was never a question he couldn't answer or problem he couldn't solve. He is invested in his students &amp; devoted to making the sculpture studio top notch &amp; running smoothly. He was both very supportive &amp; also challenging toward my work. I appreciate Daniel very much.
225,188793,Daniel,Stupar,Brown University,Fine Arts,ISPISP,5.0,3.0,Daniel is an amazing teacher.  The work he inspires and pushes students to make is exceptional.

227,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,CALCINTR,5.0,4.0,"I took freshman calculus with Prof. Banchoff at Brown in 1969-70.  He was by far the best math professor I ever had.  Creative, clear, interesting, adequately demanding, and always willing to meet individually with students."
228,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH0010,2.0,4.0,"His first-year seminar is hilarious and fun if you're interested in math but not great at it. He's an inspiring man. I'm not sure how he'd be in an actual calc class though, because he's hard to understand."
229,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH141,5.0,4.0,Best class ever!
230,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH141,5.0,4.0,Brilliant professor! He makes math look so entertaining. Too bad he is not teaching next year.
231,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA17,2.5,5.0,"Banchoff is a nice guy, but he should not teach beginner/freshman classes. He assumes his students have a level of understanding that only a few actually have, leaving most of the class confused."
232,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA54,5.0,4.0,"ONE OF THE BEST @ BROWN! Professor Banchoff is truly a fantastic educator. He is able make the most difficult math concepts seem like third grade arithmetic. He has a great personality that not only math nerds can appreciate. If you really want to learn something, take a math course with Banchoff."
233,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA18,1.5,5.0,"obviously brilliant, but disorganized teaching style.  difficult to follow train of thought, and horrible writing.  fairly written and graded exams.  online homework system is inefficient - youll spend half your time typing up or scanning your homework."
234,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA19,1.0,5.0,awful.
235,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA0054,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors at Brown.  He works you twice as hard as any other professor is likely to, but you learn twice as much in his class.  He is not interested in non-serious students, but if you want to work hard he will motivate you to love math."
236,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA8,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Banchoff. A passion for math, and math for passion."
237,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA0054,2.0,4.0,"If you are really good at math, this class is fine. But if you have the slightest confusion it is really easy to get lost because he just assumes that you know what's going on."
238,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA18,5.0,3.0,one of the best at brown
239,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA141,4.5,3.0,"Best class ever, hands down!"
240,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA8,3.0,2.0,"He is very knowledgeable, if a little discombobulated.  And what a great guy!"
241,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA35,4.5,4.0,"Even though I'd done the class material before, I had to work hard and learned a lot. MA35 with Prof Banchoff isn't for slackers, but is definitely worth the time for those who are interested."
242,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA0035,4.0,4.0,"He loves it and makes you love it, even if it's a little scary and overwhelming at first to be challenged.  He grades such that if you know the basics, you'll get at least a B.  He's fair, very interesting, very passionate."
243,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH,5.0,4.0,Banch Rules!
244,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA35,4.5,4.0,Hard but really really good
245,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA35,2.0,4.0,"I'm sure that he is a very nice man, but his teaching style is completely wacko. Everything is done on the computer including tests."
246,232504,Tom,Banchoff,Brown University,Mathematics,MA35,5.0,4.0,"Tough teacher, but he knows his stuff."
247,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,POLS820U,2.0,4.0,"He is socially awkward which negatively impacts his teaching style, but I cant necessarily fault him for that considered hes been kidnapped threes times. His intermediate level class had more reading than graduate level courses Ive taken. He cares as much as he has a capacity to, but definitely expect to self start in this class."
248,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1020,1.0,2.0,Peter Andreas is one of the most eminent authorities on the global economy but he does not make that known. In class he just reads off slides and does not provide interesting anecdotes. All the assessments are just memorization. Everything in this class can be learned by reading a book on the subjects. Boring class with no critical thinking.
249,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1020,4.5,3.0,"cool topic, learned a lot"
250,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS1000,4.0,2.0,politics of the illicit global economy was the best class i took at brown last year. definitely one of the more interesting classes i've had.
251,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1020,4.0,2.0,I love Global Illicit Economy. He is an extremely interesting guy and everyone should take this class. All you bashing PS40 should hate the subject matter not the professor. I had it with a different prof and it was awful as well.
252,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS102,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Andreas is many things, but definitely NOT mean. The previous reviewer simply seems vindictive, who knows why. PS 102 is so far a great class, popular and hard to get into."
253,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,VARIO4,1.5,2.0,"Wow--that last rating was harsh.  Peter does like to be in charge and doesn't like his opinions to be too strongly challenged, but I've never seen him be mean."
254,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS409,1.0,3.0,"A prof should serve as a mentor to his undergrads.  Peter had a personal dislike of me that was evident to others (we disagreed on methodological and normative grounds).  Now that I, in turn, teach undergrads at a top polsci dept, I am stunned that he allowed his personal feelings to be so apparent."
255,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS40IR40,3.5,1.0,"Some of the topics were interesting and he did an okay job at clarifying some more complex subjects, but the class tended to be boring.  Also his 92384 analogies got old fast."
256,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS18232,5.0,3.0,"All these ratings are for PS40, which is a huge intro lecture class that all IR students have to take.  But Prof. Andreas also teaches one of the most amazing seminars at Brown, ""Contraband Capitalism."" Take it if you can, but it is one of the most popular hardest to get into."
257,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS40,5.0,4.0,Fantastic class!!
258,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS40,1.0,3.0,"He is sooo boring trust me - - all of my friends stopped going to his lectures,,, do NOT take this class... he really really annoys me with these stupid analogies. Makes it seem as if we were 3rd graders instead of Ivy league students...""the philosophies are like tools and this is your toolbox - with it you can fix the stage of government"""
259,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS40,2.0,3.0,sooo boring with those ridiculous analogies all the time.
260,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS40,2.5,4.0,fantastic--I decided to be an IR major because of this class!
261,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS0040,3.5,2.0,"This is a standard introductory course and Andreas is a decent professor. His lectures are occassionally uninteresting but that's not necessarily his fault. He does a good job keeping the students engaged, and his powerpoint presentations decent."
262,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS0040,4.0,1.0,I LOVE HIM.
263,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS0040,1.0,4.0,one word...boring!
264,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,PS40,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher, great class!"
265,262455,Peter,Andreas,Brown University,Political Science,POL40,3.0,2.0,Introduction to IR...bites.  At least his Klingon jokes were funny.
268,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIO0020,5.0,5.0,"Professor Miller truly is a gem. While he is a great lecturer, he also takes time after class to grab lunch with students, and he devotes tons of hours to review sessions out of class. He really wants everyone to do well despite the difficulty of the course."
269,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIOL0200,5.0,2.0,Some of the best presentations and lectures I've ever seen.  Highly recommended.
270,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIO20,2.0,5.0,"super-hard! think I failed my 1st exam?? u really only need this if ur pre-med/bio major. nice guy, but the exams are killer!! Be prepared! prior bio background would help. his exams R super hard. reccommend getting exams from previous yrs 4 prior prep. good luck!"
271,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIOL0200,5.0,3.0,one of the best professors i have ever had
272,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI105,5.0,3.0,HE IS AMAZING!
273,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI20,5.0,2.0,BEST PROFESSOR AT BROWN!!!!!!!!
274,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIO20,5.0,4.0,good
275,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIO20,4.5,4.0,Great teacher.
276,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI0020,5.0,3.0,"The professor is so so so so nice that some of the students fall in love with him. He is smart, nice, funny and hot!!"
277,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIO0020,5.0,1.0,One of the most comprehensible professors I've had!
278,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI0020,4.0,1.0,"Relatively interesting novel-like approach to biology.  Annoying, strict."
279,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI20,5.0,4.0,He's GREAT!
280,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI0020,4.5,4.0,"While I think he is a tight ass, I can't help but admit that I have learned a great deal in his class.  He is very helpful."
281,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI20,5.0,3.0,"his review sessions are really helpful, he loves teaching and makes it interesting for non-bio majors"
282,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI0020,4.5,3.0,i love ken miller! he's amazing and i don't even like science! really. SO approachable and enthusiastic. he's wonderful
285,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BIO20,5.0,3.0,"It's a huge class but he makes you feel like you're the only one in there.  Great lecturer, brillant, and funny.  Doesn't get much better."
286,11392,Ken,Miller,Brown University,Science,BI0020,5.0,3.0,"enthusiastic professor, great class"
289,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,4.0,"During our semester of COVID, Prof Bower made himself accessible at nearly any hour of the day to help us complete our final project. Also, super entertaining lectures but they sometimes go too fast to keep up with so just remember to write everything down and ask in office hours. The problem sets can be a lot so start before Wed. Hope this helped!"
290,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,4.0,"A great guy and a great resource for the aspiring engineers at Brown. His class is a LOT of work though, so be prepared to put a lot of time in. Lectures are very engaging and he's hilarious."
291,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,3.0,"Hilarious guy with engaging lectures (just wish they weren't so early). He's an incredible resource in the school of engineering and offers a very unique perspective into the intersection between computing and physics. He'll make you an expert in using the MATLAB ODE solver, if anything ."
292,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,4.0,"Engaging, funny, and always accessible and looking to help students. Idk how Bower has so much time to invest in us but he really does. He is amazing!"
293,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I ever had / will ever have.
294,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bower is an amazing amazing lecturer. He provides so much office hours to make sure that nobody is falling behind. He is very very very available and helps you in all areas. I really enjoyed the lectures, sections, and group projects. I learned a lot in ENGN0040 and would recommend this class to any freshmen considering majoring in engn."
295,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,3.0,"He's great! Wants the best for his students and will literally give all his time to helping them. If you're struggling in class, you obviously haven't bothered going to see him. The material is tough but manageable with him cracking jokes. Get there early to class- he recites poetry as he sets up for lecture. Definitely one of the best engn profs."
296,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,5.0,Probably the best engineering professor I've ever had!
297,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,5.0,Very good lecturer!  Teaches very quickly but is still incredibly effective.
298,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,ENGN0040,5.0,1.0,He is incredible!
300,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,EN3,4.5,3.0,Funny guy.
301,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,EN0003,4.0,3.0,Good professor who tries to make boring material a little more interesting.  The only professor I've ever seen take out a beer can and drink it in class.
302,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,EN0003,4.5,3.0,makes boring subject material tolerable
304,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,EN3,5.0,2.0,"Makes lectures really interesting, actually has good jokes"
305,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,EN3,4.5,3.0,"Though I didn't appreciate him nearly enough when I had him, he is one of the best engineering professors out there. He genuinely cares about his students and goes out of his way to be helpful and entertaining. Just a great guy."
306,40324,Allan,Bower,Brown University,Engineering,EN03,2.0,5.0,he's ok
309,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0800,4.5,3.0,"He makes lectures interesting and has a sense of humor. 85 and above gets you an A, however it's not all that easy. "
310,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,NEUR0010,4.5,3.0,"Very clear, seems to love teaching and tries to make his lectures has interesting as possible. Neuro 1 is by the way an amazing class"
311,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN01,5.0,3.0,"Very clear, explains things really well."
312,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN01,4.5,2.0,"Good lecturer, nice guy."
314,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BIO80,4.5,2.0,"Not as good as Neuro, but still a good class."
315,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN0001,4.5,3.0,great class...paradiso and stein were awesome
316,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN1,5.0,3.0,Amazing lecturer.  Made the material easy and fun.
317,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BI80,4.5,3.0,Nice guy
318,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN001,4.5,3.0,Good guy who knows his stuff and is quite willing to help...
319,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN1,5.0,2.0,He's awesome! He connects with his students through his corny yet endearing sense of humor but still conveys to them the material completely and efficiently. Take Neuro 1 with John Stein. He's the man!
320,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN0001,5.0,5.0,fav class
321,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN0001,4.5,2.0,He's awesome!
322,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN01,5.0,2.0,this man is so hot!! and smart what else can you ask for!
323,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN1,5.0,3.0,He's just funny...
324,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BI0080,5.0,1.0,Great choice of illustrations - keeps the entire class on their toes no metter what time of day it is.  Two thumbs up!!
325,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN1BI120,4.5,3.0,"clear and organized in his lectures, can seem friendly and easy-going at times which is good"
326,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BN1BI20,4.5,3.0,"stein is the cutest, especially when he plays johnny cash and slices and dices preserved brains."
328,160401,John,Stein,Brown University,Biology,BI20BI80,5.0,3.0,Easily one of the best professors in the country. He's absolutely fantastic.
330,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CLPS1680,5.0,3.0,Dave is a delightful professor and he really knows what he is talking about. Just make sure you do the reading!
331,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CLPS1,2.5,2.0,It wasn't a hard class. I got an A having done literally none of the textbook reading (although I went to every class) but honestly I went to office hours for help and he was really unpleasant and condescending.
332,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CLPS0200,1.5,1.0,"Sobel is the most inconsiderate, unapproachable, condescending, and insensitive professor I have ever had in my time at Brown. I have chosen to take a class I am uninterested in to fulfill a final requirement rather than take a more interesting class with him. I would rather take a class and be bored than suffer through another one of his classes."
333,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,COGS42,4.5,3.0,"He's a very good teacher. If you attend classes daily, you will understand the material, and it's extremely interesting. However, he initially makes it feel like he's pretty chill for grading: only later do you find out he creates (at least for the paper) a curve. 85 = median, +/- 8 standard deviation. And he believes in tests more than he claims."
334,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG10D,5.0,4.0,"I've had Prof. Sobel for intentionality (freshman seminar) and CG42.  I was a bit miffed at some of his grading criteria, but in general I thought Sobel was extremely detailed and thorough in discussing every aspect of the topic at hand, and offered me an extremely comprehensive introduction to psychology generally."
335,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,COGS1180,3.0,3.0,"His class was not bad; he knows his material, lectures were efficient and pretty good on the whole. That being said--and it's hard to over-emphasize this--I really can't think of a worse person to take a class under. Condescending, illogically inflexible, bureaucratic, self-absorbed. Don't come close to him unless you absolutely have to."
336,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,COGS0420,4.5,3.0,"Sobel is enthusiastic and clear. He has been nothing but helpful and friendly all semester. Not to mention, the class is pretty easy."
337,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,1.0,4.0,"The 5/14 comment says it best. His standards for grading the research paper seem arbitary and based on unimportant factors, such as whether you emphasized irrelevant details at the expense of content. My sense is you need to kiss his ass to do well."
338,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,1.0,4.0,"His grading standards are strict but he refuses to adequately explain/clarify them. Apparently you're supposed to be able to read his mind. If you miss a cutoff by .5 pts, he won't give you the benefit of the doubt. He is in general unpleasant in every imaginable way. Worst teacher I've had at Brown. It's too bad, because the class could be good."
339,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,5.0,3.0,"Explanations are a little simplistic, but he has a dorky enthusiasm about the subject that makes it OK."
341,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,2.0,3.0,he is so mean and not clear with the final project...if you take the class hope and pray for a TA to grade your final report
342,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,3.5,3.0,"easy class.  he is an ok professor, a little rough around the edges, but not a bad guy."
343,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,4.5,1.0,"The class is easy, and the material is presented in an easy format.  He seems a little full of himself, but that can be amusing at times.  I didn't mind him at all."
344,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,1.5,3.0,"If you ask him a question, he is rude and automatically assumes you weren't paying attention and that otherwise you would not have this question.  Overall, he's just a mean person that thinks he's a great teacher and deserves to be quoted on the jolt."
345,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,1.5,2.0,"Unwilling to help clarify outside of class what he thinks should be learned in class, not flexible, self-inflating."
346,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG63,1.5,3.0,Miserable man. Rude and condescending and boring. Couldn't think worse of a teacher.
347,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,CG42,3.0,1.0,"**** who resents students.  Thinks he is better than everyone and sneers a lot.  Just generally not nice and presents the material in a way that does not encourage you to THINK - ironic, too, since it was a class on cognition"
349,156494,David,Sobel,Brown University,Social Science,ENG,5.0,1.0,Lets not start!!!!
351,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,3.0,5.0,"Took this class making a decision about chemistry/STEM tracks and it completely turned me off. I understand that its because the course is a weed-out for pre-med students, but it felt impossible to do well on exams as they weren't curved until the end of the course, therefore you never knew your grade."
352,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,5.0,4.0,"I took Chem 330 with Stratt and it was definitely a really difficult class that required a lot of time and energy, but it was completely worth it. I absolutely loved this class, and Stratt explained the ideas in simple and easy-to-understand ways. He is passionate and cares about his students. Definitely not an easy A, but an amazing professor."
353,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,5.0,4.0,"Incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about the material. His questions are a bit unconventional and definitely require a  lot of critical thinking, but overall, it's an amazing experience!"
354,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,1.0,5.0,"Stratt is one of those professors that only cares about the annoying guys in the class.  If you're a girl or a minority, he'll completely ignore you even if you're begging for help.  He also assumes you have parents who have PhDs in physics"
355,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,3.5,3.0,Incredibly enthusiastic and energetic lecturer who really stresses understanding the material rather than simply memorizing.
356,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM330,5.0,5.0,"Stratt is the most difficult teacher for CHEM330 at Brown, but he is also probably one of the best introductory chemistry/chemistry professors in the country.  In my class he received a standing ovation after his final lecture.  I don't think I have heard of that happening ever, so if you have the chance to take ANY class with him you won't regret "
357,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,4.5,5.0,Great teaching style. He derives equations and explains everything in detail. He is very enthusiastic and funny.
358,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,5.0,3.0,Refreshingly clear chemistry professor.
359,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,5.0,2.0,"Stratt is amazing...he is entertaining, brilliant, enthusiastic and helpful. What else do you need?"
361,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH0033,4.0,5.0,Stratt had incredible energy and was definitely a prof. I recommend to incomming students!
362,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,1.0,5.0,"****, need i say more?"
363,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH0033,4.5,4.0,I would suggest a strong chem background before taking his section.  He's very enthusiastic and was great in office hours.  Couldn't figure out if he was arrogant or just really excited all the time.  Going for the latter.
364,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,4.5,1.0,"Extremely clear lectures. Lab wasn't fun, but that's not his fault."
365,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,2.5,5.0,"good lecturer, but difficult tests and long homeworks."
366,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,4.5,3.0,Very good lecturer who was able to present difficult material in a way that was easy to understand and remember.  The exams were difficult but generously curved.  The Chem lab was terrible but he is not involved with it so he can't be blamed.  Take this professor.
367,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM33,5.0,3.0,very welcoming and happy to help during office hours. chem lab sucked- but thats not his fault.
368,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,3.5,5.0,great lecturer.  hard tests and is a jerk about grading
369,345187,Richard,Stratt,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,5.0,4.0,"Great lectures, really enthusiastic and takes interesting approaches, it's still chemistry but he usually makes up for it"
372,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,5.0,"worst. teacher. ever. in fact, to call him a teacher would be unjust. how a school that supposedly values undergraduate education can continue to allow a prof who is universally considered awful to continue teaching such a popular and important course boggles."
373,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC111,1.0,3.0,he was extremely awful
374,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,2.0,3.0,He confuses himself in his own examples and he just doesn't understand how to teach. Disappointing.
375,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11111,1.0,3.0,"The worst teacher at Brown definately.  Spends all lecture beating around the bush trying to explain one simple topic, and ultimately fails miserably."
376,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,2.0,Worst prof I've ever had. The only good thing about him is he looks like Colonel Sanders.
377,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.5,2.0,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
378,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.5,2.0,"Delivers boring lectures, doesn't explain material well."
379,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,4.0,Terrible
380,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,2.0,he's so bad i don't even know what to say. i went to class the first day and have not been the rest of the semester.
381,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,2.0,dont go to lecture
382,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,1.0,worst professor ive had yet
383,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,2.0,2.0,"His lectures are too dry and disorganized, i'm sure the man is a nice guy but he's not much of a teacher, otherwise the course is kinda easy and you'll do fine by just reading the text."
384,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11111,1.0,2.0,Likely the worst professor at Brown.
385,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,HA0001,5.0,3.0,I really liked this guy.
386,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,3.0,Terrible prof.  The worst I'v ever had.
387,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.5,3.0,"nice guy, from limited contact.  But soooo boring."
388,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,ECON,1.0,3.0,"omg this guy is soo horrible... i feel bad for him but man he sucks.  I think he has to be the worst professor i have ever come across... and this was only summer school.  my advice, dont listen in class and just read the book."
390,179558,Harl,Ryder,Brown University,Economics,EC0011,1.0,4.0,He might be the worst professor at Brown

392,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,10147,3.5,2.0,"Bernard has a killer accent and great sense of style. He is always looking sharp when he comes to class. He talks very quickly, but that's okay because his beauty makes up for it. - He lectures for a long time, but he is definitely able to hold the students' attention. He always gives interesting examples and is open to engaging with the students(:"
393,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PHIL904,4.5,5.0,this was an extremely helpful class which answered a lot of my questions. his sense of humor is great (:
394,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PHIL0080,4.0,3.0,"Most agree that Reginster is an amazing lecturer. However, I didn't find his lectures as clear as I was led to believe they would be. I felt he rushed through a lot of material. Overall, though, Existentialism was a great class. *Just be careful who you get as a TA. Definitely shop a few different conference sections and pick a TA who seems decent."
395,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,EXISTPL,4.0,1.0,He was very interesting and attractive
396,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,EXISTPL8,4.5,4.0,"Reginster is amazing. Yes, he has a reputation for being gorgeous, but there's more to it. He knows what he's talking about and if you pay attention to WHAT HE'S SAYING and not what he looks like, you'll find yourself thinking about life through brand new and intriguing perspectives. Take Existentialism."
397,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,EXISTENTIAL,4.0,3.0,"I took him for Brown's Summer program as a sophomore in high school; he is an extremely intelligent man with a good personality.  He makes things clear and interesting, even if they are not."
398,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PL8EXISTENCIAL,4.5,2.0,The class is very interesting and he delivers excellent lectures that make all the complicated readings SO simple. Good food for thought.
400,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PL0080,5.0,2.0,He is very engaging!
401,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PY0008,5.0,2.0,"Excellent lecturer, really enjoys the subject and knows what he's talking about. I still haven't done any of the readings in the class and he simplifies so much that you really don't have to."
404,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PL174,5.0,1.0,Highly entertaining. Extremely clear lectures. Simplifies difficult material. Adorable accent.
405,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PL8,4.0,2.0,"Great lecturer. It doesn't hurt that he's a great lecturer and has an amazing accent when he says lings like ""true love"""
406,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,SP174,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. I have never seen anybody prepare his lectures like he does. Good sense of humor, very relaxed. He puts together fantastic reading packages that eliminate nights in the library hunting down materials.. Highly recommend his classes"
407,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PL8,4.0,3.0,he is an awsome lecturer if you don't do the reading and just go to class you will still learn lot.  HE is never boring and the work load is very fair........you should take this class
409,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PL0008,5.0,2.0,totally hott.
410,254641,Bernard,Reginster,Brown University,Philosophy,PL0008,4.0,4.0,Knows his stuff well
411,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,ECON155,3.5,4.0,Test questions were taken straight from the review sheet however you have to figure out the answers on your own
412,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,ECON155,3.0,5.0,"Love the man. Dry and sometimes pointless lectures, but most rewarding Econ class I have taken at Brown. Very intellectually challenging material and you really have to think to understand the material.  It's def difficult to grasp esp since Borts did not just give you the answer to your question, he guided you to help you solve it on your own."
413,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC155,5.0,4.0,love this guy - his dry sense of humor was hilarious - def one of my favorite profs at Brown!
414,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC11,2.0,3.0,"just don't put yourself through it unless you have to. warning: it's not just the lectures, the tests are incomprehensible..."
415,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC0011,2.0,2.0,"I'm sure he's a nice man, just a horrible prof."
416,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC155,1.0,4.0,"Horrible demeanor, text has little relevance to the exam."
417,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC155,2.0,5.0,What a horrible class!
418,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC155,3.0,5.0,okie
419,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC155,3.5,3.0,The material isn't that hard.  But errr...
420,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.0,4.0,He was very rude in lectures--he would put down students who tried to ask questions
421,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC11,1.5,4.0,"He was a little better than Ryder, who teaches the first half, but not by much."
422,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC001,3.5,4.0,"interesting in the introductory course; definitely knows his ****, but getting very old and mumbly in lectures"
424,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC155,1.5,4.0,I didn't think Economics at Brown can get anymore dry.
426,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC011,1.0,3.0,"horrid, one of my worst profs at Brown"
427,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC11,2.5,1.0,he's the evil santa claus  (the demand and supply curve... heh heh heh)
429,15393,George,Borts,Brown University,Economics,EC0011,3.0,3.0,Hilarious
431,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor.
432,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,3.0,4.0,"Andy is passionate for CS and really puts effort to lecturing, but he's not that good of a lecturer because sometimes he goes to fast and doesn't pronounce some words clearly. You don't want to procrastinate on the projects... He is not accessible for students, like others said, its an ""army"" of TAs behind him that takes care of student needs."
433,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,5.0,4.0,"Great lecturer.  Makes you work, but don't expect to see him directly after class, send an email instead."
434,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS123,1.0,4.0,"See others' below, all true. He is past expiration date, ought to be thankful for tenure. I should have accepted Carnegie-Mellon. "
435,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,11,1.0,3.0,The sun has set on this fellow. Not sure how he''s taught so long.
436,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS123,2.0,5.0,"Has a very high opinion of himself. While he does know a lot about graphics, he tends to spend a lot of time in each class just talking about how all of his former students have amazing jobs. He likes to attach himself to those he thinks will be successful. The rest, he simply does not care about. He has no interest in helping a student in need."
437,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,5.0,5.0,Andy is the bomb in CS15.
438,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,2.0,3.0,"This guy is arrogant. ""I have another meeting with Microsoft dudes right now. See how important that is? So I'll leave u guys with my TA."" That's about him. Absolutely unavailable right after class. Almost zero concern about students. TAs are the only source. He's successful to make his lecture looks fantastic, but the content is not that great."
439,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15CS123,3.5,4.0,"The guy knows his stuff, but unless you kiss his ass, he doesn't care for you."
440,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15CS123,2.0,4.0,"The mans a legend, too important for a student. At least he has an army of TAs and brilliantly designed lectures. An oh those sweaters."
441,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS0015,4.5,4.0,"Van Dam is a very enthusiastic professor that takes great pains to make his presentations as engaging as possible. The course itself can be a lot of work, and you will need to actively seek help from TA's if you want to do well."
442,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,3.5,5.0,"so hard, so so hard"
443,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,5.0,4.0,"awesome class, so glad i'm taking it"
444,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,3.0,4.0,"Andy knows a lot about what he's talking about, and so he really likes talking.  Sometimes relevant, sometimes irrelevant.  But either way, he'll probably keep talking."
446,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15123,3.0,2.0,"Andy may be a good lecturer, but he's certainly not ""down to earth."" It's all an act in 15, kind of like him pretending to know Java. To compensate, he definitely knows graphics and has a great sense about the graphics/UI industry."
447,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, amazing course!  He's a legend in the field, and yet he's totally down to earth.  He makes computer science your most fun class."
448,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,3.5,5.0,People live out of the Sun Lab...
449,168541,Andy,Van Dam,Brown University,Computer Science,CS15,5.0,2.0,soooo much fun
450,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENGLXXXX,5.0,4.0,"As an English graduate student at another university, I look back fondly on my days at Brown and remember the best professor I have ever had in all my many years in school: Ravit Reichman. I find it hard to believe that the detractors on this website have the right person as I have never met another professor as intelligent, interesting or helpful."
451,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENGL1760,5.0,2.0,"She is a brilliant, thoughtful, and compassionate person, all of which are evident in her teaching style. For Reichman, literature is a mode of being. Through her cogent and rigorous analysis, she offers tremendous insight into life. I felt honored to be her class and benefited enormously from the experience."
452,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENGL0800,5.0,3.0,"she does read from her notes for lecture, but what she says is absolutely brilliant. she's funny and engaging, and on my papers and in my discussions with her i got some of the best and most insightful feedback i've ever received (in terms of constructiveness, not compliments). i would definitely recommend any class with her."
453,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENGL0800,1.0,2.0,"I accept that some students like her, even though their positive comments come off as a bit generic. I personally was repulsed by Reichman's stifling teaching style. She may be a Fulbright scholar and a graduate of both Yale and Oxford (god knows how), but she is incompetent and an embarrassment to the university. Respect yourselves and stay away."
454,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENGL160,4.5,4.0,"The lectures are very engaging and the novels we read were great. Only two 5-page papers and a final. We read one novel per week, so the pacing was rather quick. She is a really entertaining and intelligent person, and she really knows and cares about what she is teaching."
455,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL171,5.0,4.0,excellent indeed
456,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENG171,1.0,3.0,"I heard bad things about this prof and I should have listened: the memory of this class sits with me like old cafeteria food. I did well in the class- once I realized you just had to flatter her and say nothing she disagrees with. Prof is woefully in love with herself.As for learning anything from her hamfisted lecture style, forget it."
457,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL008,5.0,3.0,Prof. Reichman is the most engaging professor I've had at Brown. She's passionate about the material and open to discussing different viewpoints. I went to see her on a couple of occassions and she was incredibly helpful.
458,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENG176,4.0,3.0,"Wow, the people writing neg reviews here were right. Listening to this prof lecture is like looking at a mannekin wearing clothes you would never consider buying...for an hour and a half. Has same capacity for dialogue as a mannekin. Kills interest, slows attention, makes you think about getting to the exit...if you only could. Miss this."
459,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL176,5.0,3.0,Excellent and engaged. Some of my best seminar discussions at Brown have been in her classes. Not sure some of the previous posters have the right professor...
460,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,ENG171,1.0,3.0,"One of the worst classes I have ever taken- from Kindergarten to Driver's Ed to Home Ec, this is the worst. Teacher is boring and crushes the interesting comments made by students in the class. She's too self-involved to hear anyone other than herself. Sub-par and unrewarding experience. Avoid!"
461,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL171,5.0,4.0,brilliant and engaging -- a must-take that will  challenge you in the best way possible
462,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL0177,1.5,3.0,"Highly insecure and therefore highly critical of students that have the potential to one-up her in class, while she's reading her lectures word for word off the page.  Not a nice person, either.  Don't just label me as someone who didn't do well in her class, either.  (I did well.)"
463,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL171EL176,5.0,4.0,"people generally love or hate her.  she expects a lot of her students, and hard work is rewarded by lively discussion and an engaged professor.  hot!"
464,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,MODERNISM,4.5,4.0,she's smokin hot
465,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL171,5.0,3.0,Reichman is an awesome professor. And that's all I have to say.
466,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL171,1.0,4.0,She's a terrible professor.
467,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL171,1.0,3.0,"The previous poster must have either been Prof. Reichman herself or someone without a clue.  Easily the worst professor I had in my four years at Brown.  If you suggested a different interpretation of a text, she belittled you and held it against you."
468,461993,Ravit,Reichman,Brown University,English,EL171,5.0,4.0,"She's amazing -- always manages to create the best discussions, but also gives us the 'big picture framework' that adds important meanig to the works we discuss.  open and approachable -- and the books are great!"
469,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI126,2.0,4.0,"My experience with her course goes back a ways, but it did scar me. She is smart, but intolerant and disorganized, with a weakness for immature, snarky humor. Readings were either impenetrable, repetitious, or never referenced in discussion, class, or evaluations. I love Brown, but she epitomized Brown at its worst: illiberal in her liberalism."
471,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI02,4.0,2.0,"really nice, wicked hot."
472,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI2,3.0,3.0,She's alright.  Not all that bad but not all that good either. But she manages to attract the most awful TA's in the history department so until she gets rid of them-stay away.
473,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI2,5.0,2.0,"Although Dean was sarcastic and patronizing in class, she was incredibly approachable and helpful outside of it. I learned a lot from her and she has a great sense of humor."
474,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI0002,5.0,4.0,"Killer workload, but she makes it managable.  Very approachable and helpful outside of class.  Very funny also."
475,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI2,1.0,4.0,"Funny yes, organised no, clear no. Her ideas are all over the place."
477,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HISTORY,5.0,4.0,very smart and complex lectures; go take a class with her!
478,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HIS50063,2.0,5.0,"She gave only the vaguest instruction on how to do research/papers.She had her own idea of what history was, and was not at all tolerant of people who had a different approach or political views.She avoided giving any help over email or in office hours."
479,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI0002,3.5,4.0,"She was an amazing lecturer - very clear, funny and engaging. But, so much work over the course of the semester - it was really hard to keep up. And when the final rolled around, there was soo much to study and she gave little guidance of how to prepare."
480,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI0002,4.0,3.0,"Very interesting and helpful, fun lecturer."
481,40298,Carolyn,Dean,Brown University,History,HI126,5.0,3.0,best professor I've had at Brown.hands down.

488,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS1150,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Burwell is a really sweet soul. She welcomed feedback on the difficulty of quiz questions, and she always made an effort to be fair. We mainly worked in groups in this course, but she was very supportive and passionate about the material."
489,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS1150,4.5,3.0,Great class. Flipped classroom format. She was very helpful and held impromptu office hours whenever students needed help. She was incredibly reasonable about adjusting difficulty of quizzes based on student feedback and worked hard to engage students.
490,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS1400,4.0,2.0,Great open discussion environment. You get out what you put it to it.
491,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS1150,5.0,4.0,The course is a reverse class-room model where you do all the learning at home and discuss questions that came up in class.
492,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS1150,4.0,3.0,innovative class that kept me engaged.
493,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS1150,4.5,4.0,"Great class on Memory &amp; the Brain, I left with a solid knowledge on the various discourses and studies from all of the neuro-cognitive memor approaches (get ready to know everything about the hippocampus!). It's a flipped classroom which is cool bc no tests or finals, but everyday quizzes and discussion groups, overall it was tough, but very good!"
494,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PSYC104,4.5,4.0,"Prof Burwell and PSYC104 are great. I've learned so much about scientific research and writing that I've never been able to get in any other class.   Prof. Burwell is extremely helpful, friendly, and all around awesome."
495,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PSYC0750,4.0,1.0,professor burwell is very laid back in lecture and very personable both in and out of class. she was able to recommend further reading in subjects that i was most interested in. she is very knowledgable and covers a wide range of interesting neuroanatomical subjects.
496,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PSYC0750,5.0,4.0,professor Burwell really cares about the success of her students. She took the time to learn all of her students names and had it down the second day. Very interesting subject and comprehensive coverage of behavioral topics. FUN!
497,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PSYCH75,4.5,2.0,Encouraged critical thinking and discussion in small groups. was very approachable outside of class. very friendly and approachable
498,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PSYC1030,4.5,3.0,"The class was very well run.  She led a discussion at the beginning of each class which clarified any confusion from the readings.  She was very helpful with the students and TAs if any issues came up with the tasks we were doing.  Highly recommended.  She's an ace in her field, and she really knows what she's talking about. Friendly too."
499,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PSYCH0750,4.5,2.0,"What a great class! Burwell's Behavioral Neuroscience is a  course full of up-to-date, understandable, and fascinating information about the neuroanatomy and physiology behind human behavior. Professor Burwell is a great resource to have and is always willing to set aside time to answer any questions. I HIGHLY recommend this class!"
502,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PY075,1.0,4.0,"Very poor lecturer, repeats every class on earth with no new material, boring... rude... tiresome"
503,40483,Rebecca,Burwell,Brown University,Psychology,PY75,1.0,3.0,"She's awful.  The one day she forgot her notes, she canceled class. This was a survey course when I took it and she's a professor! Just ask the questions at the back of the book. She was a TOTAL FLAKE.  Avoid her at all costs."
507,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HIST1230,5.0,3.0,I took Professor Gluck's Intellectual History course thirty-five years ago and am glad to see that people are still saying it's one of the toughest and best courses they ever took. She helped inspire me to become a prof. It was the toughest course of undergrad and opened my 21-year old mind. I still have all the books and my handwritten notes!
508,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HIST12112212,1.0,4.0,"One of the worst professors in the history department.  Reads her lectures in a dull, monotone voice.  Gluck's lectures are no more enlightening than what you'd get from Wikipedia. Has nothing interesting or insightful to say.  Third-rate mind.  Also spiteful against any students who knows more than she does about the texts, which is not that hard."
509,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI121,5.0,2.0,"The best. Brilliant lecturer, wonderful person - she hosted an end-of-semester party at her house that I still remember, 15 years down the line."
510,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,INTELEXPL,3.5,4.0,"Professor Gluck gave intelligent and insightful lectures - which were consistently well organized, if not a little static. Both the reading and the grading was difficult, but manageable with commitment."
511,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI121122123,5.0,4.0,"Delivers perfect lectures.  The class is hard, but it WILL make you smarter."
512,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI121,4.5,4.0,"Professor Gluck is one of the best, most precise and insightful lecturers at Brown who is also blessed with a pleasant voice. I took European Intellectual History as a freshman and loved it--the courseload was heavy and difficult, but it really shaped the development of my mind for years to come."
513,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,EXPLODINGMODER,4.5,4.0,"elegant lecturer, provocative ideas, great style, don't hesitate to go to office hours it helps"
514,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI,4.0,5.0,BRILLIANT LECTURER...REALLY TOUGH CLASS.
515,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI197,2.5,5.0,"so boring, so dry. and very tough grader. REALLY TOUGH grader."
516,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI121,1.0,1.0,Terrible
517,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI121,4.5,4.0,"Gluck gives the most amazing and trenchant lectures I have ever heard--be prepared to take pages of notes!  Her course was very hard with difficult reading, but amazingly rewarding."
518,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,INTELLHIST,2.0,4.0,hard to deal with on a personal level
519,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HIS0123,2.0,3.0,lectures were not interesting and she was not helpful in guiding the class through dense readings. Her section leading skills were horrible.
520,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,INTHS,1.0,3.0,BORING!!  Her lectures are incredibly superficial.  Doesn't answer questions very well.
522,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI121122,5.0,1.0,"Excellent lecturer. Very clear, well-organized. Interesting material. Helpful after class."
523,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HISTORY,1.0,2.0,"Among the worst profs in the history dept.  She just reads her lecture notes, can't lead a discussion group and published almost nothing."
524,297900,Mary,Gluck,Brown University,History,HI121122,5.0,4.0,"Possibly my favorite professor from Brown.  Extremely well organized, articulate, insightful, really knows how to run a section, and very caring.  Highly recommended."
526,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0910,5.0,2.0,This class was one of my favorites. No exams - we had to write 2 short (2 page) and 1 long (14 page) final essay that was about anything we wanted connected to the course. The professor is so kind and caring. Don't forget to ask him what country he was in last week!
527,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0910,5.0,4.0,I love himk!
528,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0910,4.0,3.0,Onesimo is incredibly knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches.  Was a very cool and unique experience to take a class of his.
529,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0910,4.5,3.0,"Had two First-Year Seminars at Brown and this is a much better one. Even for those not having a background knowledge about Columbus and Da Gama, it would still be a great history class. Highly recommend to take!"
530,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0910,4.5,3.0,Best teacher i've had
531,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0910,4.5,3.0,"Great Professor. Read plenty of interesting books, but he managed to connect topics through all of them very well. Just an overall great guy to have in front of the room."
532,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0901S01,5.0,3.0,"Professor Almeida is a kind, helpful, and humorous teacher who is passionate about what he teaches. He has experience from his years of work that make the class both fascinating and relaxed. The discourse in the class is lively; the professor is open to debates on readings. Readings from the course packets are essential to gain an understanding."
533,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UNIV1520,4.5,3.0,Brilliant man!
534,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,POBS0910,4.5,2.0,Great class! Read many interesting books and the professor's awesome.
535,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UC1520,4.0,2.0,Wonderful class and an even more wonderful person.  Onesimo is an awesome professor and cares very much that his students get a lot out of the class and positively conclude their experience at Brown.  We read really great books and his insight and words of wisdom were invaluable.  I looked forward to his class every day- its a MUST TAKE!!
536,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UNIV1520,4.5,4.0,Fantastic professor and person! A wonderful conclusion to my Brown career and one of the deepest intellectual classes I've taken.
537,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UNIV1520,5.0,3.0,"Amazing class, it exposed me to different fields that I always interested me. Great way to wrap up my undergrad experience."
538,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UC1520,4.5,3.0,"This course helped draw together  disparate disciplines and modes of understanding to help me and my fellow classmates shape our world views. Professor Almeida expects a lot from students, but loves this material and is happy to explain or clarify any confusion. He is a master teacher who understands how to hold an engaging class. Take this class!"
539,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UC1520,4.0,4.0,"This class was the perfect ending to my academic career. While seemingly ambitious with the material covered, the class gets a small sample of many important modes of thinking. Everything intertwines and what is taken away from the class very much depends on what was put into it. Prof. Almeida has been teaching for 30 yrs - he knows what he's doing"
540,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UC1520,4.5,4.0,"UC1520 is ideal for a senior looking for an ""intellectual wrap-up"".  Prof is lively and engaging in his delivery of material.  Class discussion tends to follow a guided pattern, however, the meetings allow and encourage new insight, discussion and analysis.  Benefits from this course are directly related to effort, ESPECIALLY re: the final project."
541,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UC0152,3.5,2.0,"Rough accent but incredibly knowledgeable and poignantly witty. While he maintains a very professorial air, his joviality in class spices up discussion and he makes a very conscious effort to answer students' questions outside of class whenever possible."
542,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,UC152,1.5,2.0,"Very unclear, i feel like I got nothing out of his class - The shaping of world views.  When people ask questions he doesnt know how to answer he always said: ""dont worry about that now, we'll discuss it later.""  very overrated and really aggressive.  No clear goals in the course."
543,300065,Almeida,Onesimo,Brown University,Philosophy,PHILOSOPHY,5.0,1.0,"excellent, funny , witty ...."
545,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH0070,1.0,4.0,I did not get most of the topics in this class probably because the professor was going off topic way too much.
546,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH1820B,5.0,4.0,"Professor Landman will teach you the beauty of Math. He will take you far and beyond. If you are not prepared for this you simply will not be able to enjoy. Be prepared to read a lot, think hard on why things work, and how all comes together in the discipline. You have to have a very good understanding to appreciate his teaching."
547,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH182OB,5.0,4.0,"I recommend Maths lovers to take his class. Professor Landman is very accessible during his office hours, and he will talk to you about many different interesting math topics ranging from Combinatorics, Graph theory, Geometry, to Algebra. His teaching style is that of subtlety in humour and genuine appreciation of Mathematics."
548,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH0520,1.0,5.0,"Nice guy but terrible at teaching. His course is incredibly unorganized and his lectures make little to no sense. His grading is unfair and he's terrible at answering questions. Basically expect this class to be an independent study. (Taken during the summer session). Bad textbook too, which he literally acknowledged - quote: ""It was cheap."""
549,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH1270,5.0,1.0,"Top, top professor. My best at Brown. And watching Math 007 kids rating him is actually hilarious. Its like asking primary schoolers whether they like Mondrian's paintings. Obviously they dont, and even if they do, they cant begin to grasp the subtlety of Professor Landman's teaching method, which has left a lasting impression on me."
550,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH0520,1.0,5.0,"Nice guy but awful teacher. He mumbles to himself for most of class, and doesn't explain material well at all. Definitely recommend AVOIDING Landman as your professor - he is every bit the worst teacher I've ever had"
551,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH0070,1.5,3.0,"The professor is kind, but that is about it. Be prepared to show up to class and not understand a word he is saying half the time. He often mumbles and goes way off topic (you have to be there to comprehend the extent of it). You basically have to decipher the material on your own. I don't recommend taking this class with this professor."
552,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MAMA,5.0,1.0,Alot of people complain about such an easy class. He was very clear and he helped me out whenever possible
553,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA9,5.0,3.0,I don't know why other students didn't like this Prof. I enjoyed his class and felt very prepared for his tests. The homework helped me greatly and the problems were the same as he went over in class. Brown is lucky to have him!
554,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA0017,2.0,4.0,doesn't seem to like math very much but he's not a terrible teacher.  His exams are very hard; they are far more difficult than the homework assigned and the majority of the class felt widely underprepared for his exams. The class average on our exams was a 45
555,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA17,4.0,3.0,A very good class for a fast-paced review of calculus.  Allows you to work independently.  Very good class!
556,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA9,1.0,2.0,this was the worst class ive taken at brown so far...
557,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA19,1.5,5.0,"Letures are unintelligable. Problem sets impossible. A 4 or 5 on the AP test was required to get into this class, and almost no one got above a C. Unless you enjoy being miserable, take math with some one else."
558,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA9,1.5,2.0,"mumbles, doesn't explain well"
559,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA19,3.0,3.0,"It's not such a bad class : if you do the homeworks when they are out -even though they are not graded- it's ok...the midterms were optional when I took the class, but they were recommended."
560,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA0019,1.0,5.0,"Very hard class, Very confusing lectures, nearly impossible homework
 A warning to anyone thinking of taking his class:
 You will need to learn most of the material by yourself.  Some isn't even covered in class and you are expected to learn it through confusing e-mails.Avoid this teacher at all cos"
561,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA18,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor and a mean man.  You couldn't understand his lectures and when I went to his office hours for help, he essentially called me stupid for not immediately understanding his unitelligable lectures."
562,411881,Alan,Landman,Brown University,Mathematics,MA9,1.0,3.0,He was such a bad professor who was extremely unclear and mumbled when he lectured. Don't take math with him.
564,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,MCM113,5.0,4.0,"I took (way back) MCM113 Literature and Society: The Problem of Mediation and the ideas and concepts discussed there influenced me substantially. Mr. Tennenhouse appeared wide-read, knowledgeable, and, important to me: took an empiric or descriptive stance toward theories, encouraged critical discussion, and was, deliberately, gender-sensitive."
565,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,ENG490,5.0,3.0,"The two English classes that I took this semester (Shakespeare, Culture of Capitalism) were both taught by him. He is one of the best 'teachers' that I have ever had. He genuinely cares about his students, encourages class discussions, gives amazing lectures and is super approachable. The negative comments below me are nonsense. TAKE HIS CLASSES!!"
566,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,COSMO1,5.0,3.0,"This Professor is absolutely AMAZING! He's a genius, for one, incredibly well-read and has an unsurpassed knowledge of the subject matter. Leans towards semiotic theory and literary theory which reveals the profundity of his brilliance!"
568,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,ELSECT,1.0,3.0,He's rubbish.
569,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,EL000,1.0,3.0,Take his classes if you can't tell the difference between real insight and inscrutable mumbo-jumbo. Tennenhouse is also quite arrogant and unhelpful. It is no wonder that grad students talk**** about him behind his back.
570,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,EL,1.0,4.0,Very unprofessional and vindicative professor.
572,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,EL1365,2.0,5.0,"Interesting prof, but you have to be really knowledgeable about the subjext to take his course.  He gives criptic messages and lectures A LOT.  He has some odd views on literature and it's not easy to figure them out.  If you are a pro at the topic then take his class--if not, take something else."
573,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,COURSECODE,4.5,3.0,"Not much discussion in class... seems like one of those profs who wants you to listen and repeat. He lectures, you listen, you repeat.  I like classes with more discourse.  Also, agree with the person who says buying all those books was a waste.. he never got to them.  $$ matters to me."
574,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,EL30,5.0,2.0,very good lecturer
575,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,CO181,3.0,3.0,"he's a little out there and tends to fall behind on the syllabus, which sucks since you like, buy the books, but mostly, i hated his TAs. and that matters, since they're the only people who read my work. and he lectures all the time instead of having section, which is a little bit much."
576,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,EL151,1.5,3.0,"Has his *own* ideas on literary theory...  Anyway- funny guy, fun guy, but obsessed with sex- has a dirty, unprofessional use of language (lots of swears)"

580,396725,Leonard,Tennenhouse,Brown University,English,EL30,4.5,4.0,"good course.  lots of shakespeare - but taken from a non-conventional view.  interesting lecturer and very nice to talk to in person, if you need help.  very understanding and flexible."
581,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HIST0150C,4.5,4.0,"She's incredibly passionate about her topics and it shows in her lectures which are non-stop and riveting. Going to class is like heading into a 90 minute in person documentary. Loved lectures, but as a history professor she assigns an avalanche of reading (most of which is interesting, but still a lot of time). One of the best profs Ive ever had."
582,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HISTA,5.0,4.0,"No question, she is the best professor I have had.  Engaging, brilliant, organized, thoughtful.  Simply excellent!"
583,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HIST103,2.0,3.0,"Loves to talk--listening, not so much...."
584,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HI104,5.0,3.0,Fantastic teacher.  Part of the reason I majored in history.
585,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HIST103,5.0,3.0,"I had no interest at all in ""Europe in the Early Middle Ages"" before I took this class to fill a requirement. I was utterly blown away. She is such a knowledgeable and passionate lecturer, you can't help but be fascinated by the material. Grading and assignments were very fair. This is what all history professors should aspire to."
586,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HI101,5.0,5.0,"Remensnyder's Medieval history classes were my favorite at Brown! She is such an engaging lecturer, which is basically an oxymoron ;)"
587,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HI0001,5.0,3.0,She's amazing!! totally engaging and interesting.  SHe also the most organized professor I've ever had
588,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HISTOFEU,4.0,4.0,"It's been almost 7 years and I still remember her class. It was the first one I attended at Brown, before walking through the gates. She is an amazing lecturer. We kept applauding. Had more contact with the TA though who taught me how to write for college, basically. Very educational."
589,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HI0001,1.5,3.0,Not a very good professor.

592,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,1104196,5.0,4.0,She's wonderful - brilliant AND and excellent lecturer.  I'm not the only one who majored in medieval history because of her.
593,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HI103,4.5,5.0,she rocks! Why else would I walk 25 mins to Smith B. at 9 am!!
594,11382,Amy,Remensnyder,Brown University,History,HI1,5.0,2.0,one of the best (and only) female professors i've had

598,40291,Herve,Vanel,Brown University,Fine Arts,HA90,4.0,3.0,he's the best prof in the department.  inspired lectures.  he's far from didactic and students have to think for themselves--many other professors just want to hear you regurgitate their own ideas.
599,40291,Herve,Vanel,Brown University,Fine Arts,HA88,5.0,3.0,Vanel is the best
600,40291,Herve,Vanel,Brown University,Fine Arts,HA88,1.0,1.0,please speak so i can understanr

605,40291,Herve,Vanel,Brown University,Fine Arts,HA89,4.0,3.0,herve is the greatest!  he often has time to meet and chat after class over a coffee.  he is really personable and interesting (though just occasionally too opinionated).  i like his class so much because it is so evident that he loves what he does.  he inspires me.
606,40291,Herve,Vanel,Brown University,Fine Arts,HA88,4.0,3.0,the previous poster is crazy!!  i have never had a more intellectually stimiulating prof in the past three years at brown.  i take every course vanel offers-he is so magnetic

Pucci is too good for this world, the dude is a saint among men and the single best teacher I have ever had- not a ton of work, but hes incredibly knowledgeable and you learn a ton. Great seminar style, he always fosters deep and fascinating discussions."
616,163263,Joseph,Pucci,Brown University,Classics,CLAS1120,5.0,3.0,"More than a great professor, he is like a loving father to me. AMIABLE. I took his class thrice and alway had a good time. He is willing to help under all situations. He listens to my troubles and is good at consoling. And his office is a FANTASTIC little vestibule to hang around! He's the one who I rely on at this place far from home. THANKS."
617,163263,Joseph,Pucci,Brown University,Classics,CLAS1120,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic teacher, incredible mentor, gifted and original academic. Has integrally shaped the way I think about not just classical literature but literature as a whole. Some are put off initially by his quiet eloquence and low reading load but if you let him he'll change your world. Informal class style but intensely academic discussions. GREAT."
618,163263,Joseph,Pucci,Brown University,Classics,CL112,5.0,2.0,"Pucci strikes that delicate balance between passion for his field &amp; his more droll, playful side. Encouraging &amp; always available for questions/feedback. He's committed to building personal connections with students, making him a great mentor long after a course ends. Plus: love his voice... &amp; not bad to look at;)"
619,163263,Joseph,Pucci,Brown University,Classics,CL112,5.0,2.0,"Joseph Pucci is a great professor: droll and amiable, able to foster a relaxed classroom environment, and clearly fascinated by the material he teaches. One of his talents as a professor is interweaving classical texts and modern themes; the course never seemed like a tour of a dead world."
620,163263,Joseph,Pucci,Brown University,Classics,CL112,5.0,1.0,"He is everything you could ask for: patient, extremely invested both in the material and making it accessible, eager to share as an equal, more concerned with what you explore than with how to evaluate you. Professors like Pucci are the heroes of my education."

631,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN51,4.0,4.0,"fast paced, knowledgable, helpful, supportive, challenging"
632,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN159,5.0,5.0,"Explains things really well.  He's an incredibly smart guy, and sometimes he goes really fast and it's easy to get behind &amp; lost, but he's very willing to answer questions in and out of class.  Also, He prides himself on being difficult which makes the class hard, but also forces you to learn more (which after all is kind of the point)."
633,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN51,4.0,3.0,"hmm maybe it has changed in the past year, but i thought zaslavsky did a great job.  E and M is just a very difficult subject; I think he was as clear as you could be with that kind of material."
634,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN52,1.0,5.0,teaching seems not to be his forte
635,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN51,3.0,4.0,"He assumes that students know more then they do.  He's a smart guy, but it's hard to learn in a large lecture class with him in the lead.  E&amp;M is bad to begin with, Zaslavsky knew his stuff, just went a little fast sometimes."
636,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN51,4.0,4.0,"very nice, relatively clear, but does make assumptions as far as students general knowledge goes"
637,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN52,1.0,5.0,"The worst part was when I tried to get extra help...his response was, ""Didn't you go to lecture? Didn't you do the reading? Didn't you do the homework? You should understand this."""
638,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN52,1.0,4.0,awful as could be
639,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN52,2.0,5.0,"class could have been MUCH better, maybe i could've learned w/ a dif. prof."
643,40322,Alexander,Zaslavsky,Brown University,Engineering,EN51,1.0,5.0,Zaslavsky's the worst....  He made E&amp;M worse for everyone involved.
646,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,ENG913,5.0,3.0,"You will get used to her analogy of journalism to anthropology:Its all about entering a new, strange environment and using your instincts to find out whats going on."" As a navigator, Professor Breton is really good at arousing your curiosity and human nature."
647,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,ENGL116,4.0,5.0,Wonderful. And she takes the time to make you better.
648,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,ENG913,4.0,4.0,"I took her for a summer course and she was a great professor. She was a little scary at first, but then as the three weeks progressed, she was much friendlier. I feel that she really cared about us (the students) and I learned a lot from her."
649,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,ENG913,4.0,3.0,"I took her intro to journalism course for a summer program. She was a bit intimidating at the beginning, but she mellowed as the class progressed. In just three weeks, she helped me pinpoint my strengths and weaknesses and gave me helpful advice in becoming a stronger writer. There's quite a bit of work, but the feedback you receive is worth it."
650,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,EL116,4.0,5.0,"She will make you a better writer--no question. But this is a class to make room for. You can have up to 20 hours of H.W. when you include prep time for interviews, and the interviews themselves, coupled with the writing. I am a slow writer, so it was even more. Nevertheless, she was invested and helped me produce my best work yet."
651,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,EL16EL116,3.0,4.0,"There are some great things about Breton's classes.  Unfortunately, actually going to class usually isn't one of them.  She spends too much time tooting her own horn and repeating herself.  However, she gives interesting assignments and helpful feedback.  Her classes are not easy but they will make you a better writer/journalist."
652,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,EL116,5.0,5.0,"Get ready for a part time. It's a great class if you're OK with that, but it's definitely tougher than EL16, even with only 4 stories. I liked EL16, and I wouldn't do this class unless you did, and in many ways I've liked this more because of the re-writing and workshopping that didn't exhist in the lower level."
653,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,EL16,4.0,5.0,"Intimdating.  She actually cared about teaching journalism though and thoroughly reads EVERYTHING, including rewrites.  Definately not an easy class, and she's not a ""nice"" professor, but you are forced to learn about journalism, get off campus, get really good at writing fast and concisely... Just don't expect it to be easy or fun."
654,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,JOURNALISM,4.0,3.0,"i took a summer course, but she was really nice and took an interest in her students. it seemed like she really cared. also, she brought in a lot of really interesting speakers"
655,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,EL16,1.0,5.0,the worst class i've taken at Brown
656,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,SUMMERJ,4.5,5.0,"she's a fabulous professor, tough, but really nice if you get on her good side. that means: do the work, rewrite when u need to, participate, and show good journalistic instinct. and if you need help, dont understand something, or need advice, GO TO HER!"
657,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,EL16,1.5,3.0,"Argh, how dreary. She was so annoying. I don't want to be a journalist anymore."
659,68131,Tracy,Breton,Brown University,English,EL16,2.5,4.0,could she be any less pleasant?
661,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,ENG41,4.5,4.0,"Egan is a joy as a person, even more than a professor perhaps, although he is a great one. I took an FYS with him, and it is still one of the most discussion based classes I've taken here. He is incredibly good about meeting with students and forming a personal bond. Reasonably tough grader, but fair. Go for it!"
662,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,Professor Egan was my favorite professor ever.  I became a much more analytical person after taking his courses - and I appreciate that he took the time to meet with us all one-on-one.  I received a B in my 1st class with him - but the A I got in the 2nd class with him was the most meaningful A I have received in my life.
663,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,ENGSECT,5.0,4.0,"Professor Egan was my favorite teacher ever -- and I am writing this 8 years after graduating!  He really cared not only about the subject, but about each student as a person as well.  He's the best!!"
664,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EN151,5.0,2.0,"I took two different upper level seminars with Professor Egan and really enjoyed both. He encouraged discussion by having people post questions ahead of time, and always came up with interesting threads and themes from student contributions. He offered really helpful feedback on writing assignments and is also a really nice guy with great stories."
665,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,ENGL0450,1.5,5.0,"I have always loved English, but this class was extremely frustrating for me. Egan is impossible to please when it comes to essays. In spite of myself, I have to admit that my writing improved, but every time I got a paper back from him I wanted to cry. He is very willing to meet with students, but these meetings are not particularly helpful."
666,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,ENGL0450,2.0,4.0,"Egan is a good guy who really cares about his students. The problem is, this was a seminar, and he didn't do a very good job leading the discussions. He also grades pretty tough on papers and is not very clear when explaining what he wants to see. Definitely shop this class before you commit."
667,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL41,1.5,2.0,"He was the worst English teacher I've ever had.  He didn't prepare for class and brought up very few interesting points.  I went to his office hours about an essay I had written and he was literally no help.  Instead of describing to me how to improve my writing, he told me that I was a poor writer and didn't even deserve the grade he had given me."
668,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL41,2.0,3.0,"Although he at first seems entertaining and charismatic, upon further examination his teaching is intellectually uninspired and his ideas vague and flaky.  I owuld not reccomend taking his class."
669,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL41OR42,2.5,3.0,"Good thing they got rid of this class.  He seemed like such a nice guy, and he occasionally had some interesting things to say, but this class was miserable.  It actually almost convinced me not to major in English.  Little discussion of the actual texts, which were generally awful"
670,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL131EL151,4.5,2.0,"Good-hearted guy with a great sense of humor and serious passion about what he teaches.  I got really into the subject matter even though it was not my vup of tea beforehand, and we got to take frequent trips to the JHay and the JCB to look at primary sources.  One of my favorite professors."
671,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL131EL151,5.0,2.0,"a good man with a bright, shiny head on his shoulders.  best humorous asides ever, but also manages to make powerful conclusions at the end of discussion.  everything he says is planned years in advance and tested on several focus groups."
673,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL41,1.0,4.0,"Lectures had nothing to do with the actual text, but instead talked about the history and culture *surounding* the text.  Makes it hard to do well on  papers and tests,when no one talks about the literature itself.  ugh."
674,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL131,4.0,2.0,"He's funny, cool, I was never a colonial lit person but he definitely made us all get into it. Thanks Egan!"
675,579791,Jim,Egan,Brown University,English,EL41,4.5,2.0,What a cutie pie.  Lovin the colonial lit in spite of myself/
676,641748,ED,Tomassi,Brown University,Music,PSIJ321,5.0,2.0,"Ed is one of the best teachers at Berklee. He teaches some heavy harmony but encourages soloists to play melodically, developing motives. This is something that is often overlooked. If you want to play musically and have a variety of tools to do so, he's that guy. He's also got a great sense of humor. Check him out playing tenor on YouTube."
677,641748,ED,Tomassi,Brown University,Music,PRIVA1111,5.0,1.0,Great teacher

692,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PHIL101,4.0,1.0,Justine was a great TA - always tried to stay tied to connect w trends &amp; 'teenage' lingo - talked bout aliens in middle of class cuz some kid mentioned the pyramids being built by 'em. Free to chat aft class &amp; took us on an out of ski trip. Spoke her mind &amp; prepared study slides &amp; guides for exams &amp; such.
693,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PHIL0360,5.0,3.0,"He is enthusiastic, somewhat funny and extremely knowledgeable!"
694,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PHIL35,5.0,5.0,MY HERO. The one who introduced me to philosophy and made me love it. Great accent. He is one of my best memories about Brown and among the very few people who I treat as family. LOVE HIM and will definitely miss him and the days spent in his office... GREAT office with great books. Amiable man and a strict philosopher!
695,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PHI121,5.0,1.0,"He has an infectious enthusiasm, excellent professor."
696,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,LOGICA,4.5,3.0,"He is very helpful, willingness to meet outside class is second to none (he came in on a sunday to help me!)"
697,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,EARLYMODERNPH,3.5,4.0,I really really didn't enjoy this class.  He was so boring.
698,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PHI121,2.0,4.0,"He was too difficult to understand. . .the accent got in the way.  Also, seemed distracted during the lecture; fidgety and uninterested."
699,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PL170,5.0,1.0,Very clear lectures. Well organized.
700,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PL36,3.0,2.0,I second the previous opinions: the subject matter could be interesting but Broakes is rather dull.
701,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PH101,1.0,2.0,"good accent, bad class"
703,25652,Justin,Broackes,Brown University,Philosophy,PHILOSOPHY,1.5,3.0,"he loves the subject, but he can't make it interesting for anybody else.  great accent, though."

707,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEOL0220,1.0,4.0,She's the reason I'm not a geology concentrator. Incredibly disrespectful and discouraging.
708,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEOL0220,5.0,4.0,It's so rare to find a Professor who genuinely cares about her students
709,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEOL0220,2.0,5.0,"She is really tough, but knows her stuff. Can be somewhat rude and disrespectful sometimes."
710,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEOL0220,4.0,4.0,"Jan is astounding. She is incredibly meticulous, which becomes a problem because if you don't phrase an idea in her particular words she wont understand. She is so willing to go a mile out of her way for you, connect you with your interests, introduce you to scientists and alums, and KNOWS EVERY UNDERGRAD by name, home state, concentration, and all"
711,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEOL0220,1.0,4.0,I came to Brown intending on studying Geology and it was primarily because of Jan that I decided against doing so. She is an awful teacher (very difficult to understand and incredibly discouraging) and quite possibly an even worse adviser.
712,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEO0220,5.0,3.0,She made herself consistently available for homework help as well as more general help with course material. She showed a enthusiasm and mindfulness rare for an introductory undergrad class at a top-tier university. She had an uncanny ability to propagate her own enthusiasm and to dissect complicated ideas into easily digestible information.
713,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEOA,5.0,4.0,"Jan is an outstanding professor, she influenced my decision to go into research.  She is truly passionate about learning, and has developed and adapted her teaching method such that it is very constructive and inspiring.  She is my muse!"
714,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GE0022,5.0,3.0,Amazing. Meet this woman.
715,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GE22GE145,4.5,3.0,An amazing professor! She really wants to make sure every student understands the material. She is the reason I became a geo major.
716,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GEO24GEO145,5.0,4.0,"The best geo teacher, in fact probably the best overall teacher I've ever had."
717,11384,Jan,Tullis,Brown University,Science,GE22,4.5,4.0,"She is really enthusiastic about the subject, but can be rather impatient at times."
721,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,ANTHROPOLOGY,5.0,4.0,Love her!! Great woman!! Amazing and interesting! So smart ! Such an interesting person and a great teacher and mentor . Greatest doctor I know!
722,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,ANTH200,2.0,2.0,She is all over the place! Her lectures never make sense. And the class should be called Babies across cultures
723,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,ANTH0200,2.0,3.0,"Lectures not always clear.  She lectured for an hour, only writing one or two things on the board so it was hard to determine what was actually important."
724,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN113,4.0,3.0,"Very interesting lectures, mixed up with movies.  Good at facilitaing discussion.  Always had something interesting to say about her own personal field work."
725,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN20,3.5,3.0,My only complaint is that she's not loud enough
726,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN20,3.0,3.0,"she's really nice, but the lectures are a bit unclear"
727,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN20,1.5,3.0,"Hollos speaks too softly during lectures.  Also, her lessons are disjointed and it's often hard to tell which parts of her lectures are important enough to write down."
728,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,SEVERALANS,1.5,5.0,"I took a few classes from Professor Hollos back in the day and she was my advisor, which she was horrific at. I also got remarkably bad grades in her class compared to my grades in all my other Brown classes. Inscrutable. Not recommended."
729,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN20,3.5,2.0,"I don't know why she is so disliked. I had her freshman year and I still remember so much from that class - I learned a lot. She had a very cynical, wry way about her that I enjoyed. I remember the last day of class she said, ""Even though I don't know any of your names, I am going to miss you all!"""
731,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN20,1.0,4.0,"Her worst moment was when she flipped out when a student, who was visibly ill, came in 20 minutes late and she told her that she shouldn't have bothered coming if all she was going to do was disrupt the class."
732,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN20,1.5,3.0,"The material is interesting, but her lectures make you question whether or not you want to stay. The lectures are dry. The grading is completely unfair (me and my friend answered the same question exactly the same and she got points off where I had not)."
733,253642,Marida,Hollos,Brown University,Anthropology,AN20,1.0,2.0,"Her lectures are entirely unnecessary if you read the nexts because all she does is reiterate what was assigned.  She doesn't speak loudly or clearly, and often speaks to the chalkboard, so if you feel the need to understand her, you have to be up front."
735,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,ENGL1140A,1.0,3.0,Gives very vague assignments and feedback. He put more white writers on the syllabus who wrote the N word than writers of color (2 total). He challenged someone in the class who asked for more writers of color. I didn't learn much in his class.
736,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,ENGL0930,5.0,3.0,"Anyone who is interested in language and writing should take Professor Stanley's class. He is one of the most patient people I've met, and he schedules private meetings with all of his students every two weeks; thus, if you are shy, you don't have to forcibly try to get to know him. He can even make theoretical readings interesting and approachable"
737,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,ENGL1140A,5.0,4.0,"many semesters after taking his class, i find myself using professor stanley's advice and wisdom in my day-to-day writing and thinking. a vital class for anyone interested in literary criticism or the art of close reading."
738,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,EL11,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor. Very vague, and didn't help at all. Don't even think of taking his class."
739,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,ENGLISH,5.0,2.0,"Very patient, very dedicated professor. Always has student papers on his desk, and is always reading them. Learned a lot from him."
740,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,WRITING,4.0,4.0,"Great guy.  So helpful, ezpects a lot, but worth the efort."
741,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,EL11,5.0,2.0,go to office hours to really get to know him
742,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,EL118,5.0,3.0,recomended

744,260218,Lawrence,Stanley,Brown University,English,ENGLISH,3.5,3.0,he's good.
748,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,ECON110,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING person! I would take the class again just because I enjoy his teaching style, jokes, and presence. Great person overall, and certainly makes Brown University a better place to be."
749,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC11,4.5,1.0,"A good lecturer, but the tests were way too easy that studying was a waste."
750,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC0011,5.0,1.0,A great professor
751,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC11,4.5,2.0,what an awesome guy.

753,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC11,5.0,3.0,"i love him! hes absolutely precious.  Never take econ 11 in the fall, take it in the spring with Serrano.  he makes you want to go to lecture"
754,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC11,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. The best I've had so far at Brown. Very clear, precise, funny, and responsive to questions. Also impressive how he memorizes overheads before lecturing. He obviously cares very much about doing things right."
758,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC11,4.5,3.0,"he makes econ funny, how shocking."
759,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC11,5.0,1.0,"I love this guy.  Econ11 is by far my favorite class, no question!"
760,358721,Roberto,Serrano,Brown University,Economics,EC11,5.0,1.0,This guy is so funny. Definitely the best teacher I have had so far.

773,40425,Jimmy,Xu,Brown University,Engineering,EN51,1.5,4.0,"awful class, aviod at all cost, unless you're an engineer..."
774,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,ENGL1510,2.0,4.0,"So surprised at the good comments! Gould is verbose-he uses unnecessarily long words while trying to look cool, which made me think that even he doesn't understand what he's saying. He doesn't make sure everyone has a chance to participate, allowing his favorites (the talkers) to go on and on. Half what people said in this class was bs/vocab words."
775,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,ENGL1560,4.5,3.0,"Took a seminar on Melville with Prof Gould.  He is a very knowledgeable about 19th and early 20th century literature and history; provokes stimulating discussions and responds positively to comments in class. Very approachable and sets up extra office hours to talk with students about essays, and give feedback.  Made me fall in love with Melville!"
776,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,ENGL0600,1.5,4.0,"Very surprised to see other comments. The most boring professor I've ever had (and this is my final year). No original thoughts, no spark, no clear idea of what he's doing in class, and extremely awkward as a bonus. His class is a complete waste of time."
777,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,EL151,5.0,3.0,I believe this man knows everything.
778,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,EL151,5.0,3.0,What a man.  What every man should aspire to.
779,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,EL156,5.0,4.0,Gould is the man.  Great prof.--one of Brown's best.
780,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,EL156,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful professor and wonderful man.  Though I usually hate early colonial literature, he made is amazingly interesting.  Plus, his feedback on assignments were incredibly helpful.  I definitely felt like a better writer at the end of his class."
781,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,EL156,5.0,3.0,Prof Gould is amazing.  He really gets you to tap into the material in a way that interests you.  He treats students as intellectually curious and brings a wealth of information to class.  Professor Gould ROCKS!
782,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,EL151,5.0,3.0,Prof. Gould rocks my world.  He made the most boring stuff interesting.  And for how busy he is he really takes the time to help you/talk to you.
783,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,ENG,3.0,3.0,Thought he was pretty cool for teaching at Brown and even wore a tweed jacket woith the elbow patches just to make sure everyone knnew he was a professor.  He also contantly reminded us that he had also gone to Brown - when it was more challenging
784,58795,Philip,Gould,Brown University,English,AMREN,5.0,3.0,"This man brought Hawthorne to life for me.  As a high school English teacher, I constantly find myself reaching back to his class!"
787,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,EDUC1850,5.0,2.0,"Professor Li is a wonderful professor. There are very few academics who care as much as she does about her work. If you're looking for a thoughtful, adorable, and caring teacher in education, I highly recommend taking her classes."
788,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,EDUC0000,4.0,2.0,Enjoys teaching and working with students!
789,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,ED80,4.0,2.0,"Professor Li is GREAT!  She was incredibly approachable, and the workload for her class was managable.  The take-home exams were great, and not too difficult if you went to her lectures."
790,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,ED80,5.0,2.0,"She gives very interesting lectures and she is a very approachable person herself. The class is not hard if you go to her lectures because the take home exams's answers are all in her notes, so it is not that hard to get an A in the class."
791,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,VARIOUSEDS,4.5,3.0,"Professor Li is great. She's so enthusiastic, and loves to meet one on one. She loves for undergrads to assist her on her research. She's a good person to know at Brown.  Her classes are interesting and the workload isn't too bad. Recommended."
792,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,ED80,4.0,3.0,amusing because she's crazy and always talks about her son. lecture was ok clarity but i was often bored by the end. she seems like a good person but didn't make me excited about the material. take home everything was awesome. made class gut-like. she LOVES visitors.
793,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,ED80,1.5,4.0,"Easy, but boring. Very boring. Her lectures are scattered and largely unrelated to readings/class material."
795,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,ED80,4.5,2.0,Great teacher. She really knows her stuff. Loves to meet 1-on-1.
796,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,ED80,5.0,2.0,jin is great -- very friendly -- funny in a way I'm not sure she's conscious of -- take home midterms were fantastic
797,153777,Jin,Li,Brown University,Education,ED158,4.0,1.0,"jin li is the best, she's so funny, this class is interesting and pretty easy. she always welcomes student discussion and the midterm is take-home"
799,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HIST179,4.0,3.0,Pretty good lecturer.  Left a section in the middle of each class to take questions and answer them.
800,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HIST179,5.0,2.0,Great guy!
801,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HIST0510,4.0,2.0,A genuinely nice fellow.  His American History to 1877 was geared as much towards and understanding of antebellum America as the practice of historical analysis.  Not difficult if you take his class seriously.  Had a nice semester and am now considering a history concentration.
802,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HI179,5.0,3.0,"An absolutely wonderful lecturer, advisor, and human being (though I must admit he's not a great section leader). The course (North American Environmental History) was the best I've ever taken, and I won't miss out on another Jacoby-taught course."
803,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HIST97,2.0,3.0,"This class was a freshmen seminar on the California Gold Rush.  He said about 30 words the whole discussion.  I have heard he is a wonderful lecturer, but he seemed like an extremely dull person in this freshmen seminar.  I would like to take his larger lecture classes, but this one kind of sucked."
804,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HI0051,3.5,2.0,Deserved a better grade
805,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HI0179,5.0,4.0,"I LOVED THIS CLASS!  JACOBY IS AWESOME!  VERY INTERESTING MATERIAL, MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY, NICE GUY.  TAKE THIS OR YOU'LL BE MISSING OUT.  I LOVE YOU JACOBY!!!!"
806,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HI0051,4.0,2.0,"Jacoby is one of the best professors that I have had at Brown.  He has dull and shinnning moments, never ordinary.  Good guy, recommend him."
809,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HI179,5.0,4.0,an awesome teacher and an awesome guy! my favorite professor at brown!
810,254307,Karl,Jacoby,Brown University,History,HI51,5.0,3.0,"Pretty good looking if not hot. Very nice, funny and informative."
811,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,SLEEP120,2.0,1.0,"For a scientist, she focuses on the intensely superficial.  More concerned with conveying information in a ""fun"" way than with actually conveying information of any use at all.  Incredibly boring, and I resented the class for its superficiality."
812,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS0120,3.5,1.0,"The material in the course was interesting, and she presented it fairly well.  Tests were easy, and if you can memorize, you're fine.  I thought problem sets were unfairly graded, and some things weren't nearly fair.  Sometimes she's upbeat and keeps students interested, but sometimes she's pretty mean.  She's brilliant in her field.  Up to you."
813,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,1.5,2.0,"The science of sleep is incredibly intersting; however, I found most of these lectures to be long, difficult to sit through, and boring.  Although Professor Carskadon is considered to be an expert in her field, I found her to be rather unimpressive compared to most teachers  at Brown.  Altogether, I would not recommend this class or Carskadon."
814,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,4.0,2.0,"Every Brown student should take this class.  Prof Carskadon is funny and makes the material interesting and fun.  It's easier if you are taking or have taken Neuro 1, but I got along fine without it.  This is an especially great class for freshmen because it will help you plan your college life around healthy sleep patterns, and it's not much work."
815,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,3.0,1.0,easy A
816,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,3.0,3.0,"Mixed on this class - she can be a very tough grader on written stuff, but the tests were easy. The classes could get tedious, and she was sort of ****y. However, she is an extremely well-known expert in her field and Brown is lucky to have her."
817,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,3.5,2.0,"This class is great as a 5th, or for someone looking for an interesting but very manageable work load.  Prof. Carskadon can be interesting at times, but generally her lectures were painful to sit through, especially after the first hour."
818,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,4.5,2.0,I absolutely LOVED this class. By far my favorite last semester.
819,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,4.0,2.0,One of my fav classes at Brown...prof is entertaining and funny; she is motivating (but lectures got boring at times)
820,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY0055,1.5,3.0,"She is very mean and sarcastic in lectures. She is world reknowned and is a Queen in her field of sleep and dream psychology. However, Carskadon is intimidating and very unfriendly. Take her class with caution."
821,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,3.0,3.0,"Lectures were kinda boring, but she taught me a lot."
822,363144,Mary,Carskadon,Brown University,Psychology,PY55,4.5,2.0,Lectures include humor
823,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,POLS1821,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cheit is an amazing, dedicated professor and a real asset to Brown. It's true, he doesn't coddle his students but he is fair, committed to his studentsand  smart as hell. You have to work when you're in his class but it's more than worth it. By far my favorite professor at Brown."
824,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS182,1.0,2.0,I wanted to like this class. But he was disorganized and would be at best dismissive of any comments not perfectly supporting him.  Mostly he would try to encourage discussion then shoot down everyone. liked brown nosers. Even with getting a good grade in the class and liking the reading I will avoid him.
825,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,POLS100,1.0,2.0,"This guy is really quite a bad teacher -- and watch out for a crazy temper and childish fits. I found him very self-satisfied and smug, but not smart or informed. Oh well!"
826,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS182,5.0,4.0,Best teacher at BROWN!!!!!
827,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS0010,3.0,3.0,"I didn't really like this class, I feel as though it would be a good half-semester class, all the essays are redundant and i just have to believe there is more to public policy than efficiency equity and effectiveness.  Cheit also encourages participation but then constantly shoots down those who speak..."
828,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS10,4.0,2.0,"He was a really nice guy, and the classes weren't that boring. However, I didn't feel like I learned all that much from this class."
829,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS10,4.0,3.0,Cheit is probably the most helpful prof I've encountered at Brown. His class is a work in progress so I won't judge him on it. He's extremely knowledgable and has a great ability to lead and provoke discussion without dismissing viewpoints or making students feel stupid.
830,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS10,3.0,1.0,"Class was somewhat redundant and very basic, quite dull as a public policy class... Cheit is involved but not the most organized nor most exciting lecturer"
831,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS10,4.0,2.0,Lectures somewhat disorganized - great enthusiasm for the topic though!
834,550911,Ross,Cheit,Brown University,Political Science,PS10,5.0,4.0,"Brilliant and enthusiastic, as well as knowledgeable."
835,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN0600,5.0,2.0,"Super energetic and enthusiastic. She's truly a gem in the French department -- haven't heard a single student say that s/he dislikes Stephanie. The feedback she gives on assignments is super helpful, and she's very encouraging of her students. Love her!"
836,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN600,5.0,3.0,Best professor ever.
837,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FRE100,4.5,2.0,"Great, approachable, and French. Awesome teacher."
838,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN500,5.0,3.0,She is a truly passionate professor. Her energy is contagious. She was extremely helpful and really cared about her students' progress. She has rekindled my love for the French language.
839,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN0600,5.0,3.0,"She is one of the best professors I've had. She is fun, energetic, and truly loves what she's teaching. She is very knowledgeable and is very interested in the progress of her students. A+!"
840,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN0500,5.0,3.0,She is the best!
841,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN0500,5.0,5.0,"She is so optimistic and enthusiastic about what she teaches, which makes it fun to be in class."
842,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN1510,4.5,2.0,"She's a really helpful, kind, fun professor.  She takes students' interests into account while teaching."
843,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FREN105,5.0,1.0,She really is the best !
845,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FR0020,5.0,3.0,"she is a phenomenal, possibly the best language teacher i have ever had. she is smart, energetic, and clearly works extremely hard, which motivates the students to work hard, as well. besides, i've hardly ever heard her speak a word of english. i hope she can quickly move up the ladder at this school. she certainly deserves it!"
846,741325,Stephanie,Ravillon,Brown University,Languages,FR60,5.0,2.0,"She's so cute and perky and nice to her students.  Always speaking in French, always ready to help."
847,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,1410,4.5,4.0,"Sometimes guidelines were not clear but like others have said, office hours! She is the most caring professor at Brown. Seriously one of a kind. And not only will you learn a ton but if you take good notes you will remember things that will be useful for the rest of your life."
848,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENVS1410,4.5,3.0,"Caroline is a humanities professor, but her class is NOT easy. However, she genuinely loves her students, which is why lawyers for the EPA and current Tier I law students frequently come back to thank Caroline for her class. If you're confused, go to office hours. Your grade will thank you and you'll find a great new mentor!"
849,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENVS1410,5.0,2.0,"I'm surprised by the negative comments here. Caroline's class is taught like a law class, but she loves and cares about her students in an extremely genuine fashion. If you talk to her for five minutes, you will realize how brilliant and passionate she is. I would highly recommend taking her environmental law courses."
850,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ES510,3.0,3.0,"Karp knows a lot, but her lectures can be unclear and the class was fairly unorganized. That said, I still very much enjoyed the class, as the assignments and projects were interesting and thought provoking. Karp is great if you seek out the help, but at times her lack of organization can be frustrating."
851,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENVS1,2.0,2.0,She's  definitely by far the worst professor I've ever had. By the end of my junior year I had a stronger understanding of environmental issues than she did. She doesn't understand anything and doesn't know how to teach anything. She's just really good at playing the politics of academics and at acting like she's an expert.
852,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENVSENVS,4.5,3.0,"Professor Karp is fantastic. She really engages students in environmental issues and does a good job explaining these issues to students like myself with little ENVS background. She's very open and approachable. Her classes are flexible--not a lot is required, and what you give in time and effort is what you get from the class."
853,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ES152,4.0,4.0,"I have taken two classes with Caroline and I have found her to be one of the most approachable, passionate teachers I've had at Brown. Yes, sometimes class is disorganized, but if you spend 30sec after class to chat with her, she'll clear up any lingering questions. Spend 10 minutes with her and you'll probably want to make her work your life's wor"
854,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENV110,3.5,4.0,"Dispite other comments, I found her class to be interesting. Although lecture was disorganized, she was friendly and helpful when needing help."
855,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENVS0110,1.5,1.0,"Terribly boring class and worst professor I've had yet by far. I wish I'd know I could have skipped this class with AP credit, it was atrocious.  It was insanely easy though, and readings were all unnecessary to a good grade. I suppose the other reviewer is right about her friendliness though."
856,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENVS153,2.0,5.0,"Professor Karp is by far the worst professor I've had at Brown.  She is a terrible lecturer, and is very unclear about what she expects out of assignments.  She never explains anything clearly and constantly jumps around instead of focusing on one thing at a time.  Her one redeeming quality is her friendliness."
857,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ENVS0110,2.0,2.0,"This professor is so horribly disorganized and as a result most of what she tries to teach us does not make nearly as much sense as it should, despite the fact that the material is actually really not impossible to learn.  She just doesn't know how to teach.  She is by far the worst professor I've had at Brown."
858,892320,Caroline,Karp,Brown University,International Studies,ES0011,1.5,4.0,Professor Karp is horribly disorganized and lectures are dull. I would never recommend taking a course with her.
859,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ADLS,4.5,2.0,I'm Speechless about this wonderful Professor. I'll just say one thing. A person can feel the energy being infused in him by this certain Great teacher and one can feel the glory of her Enthusiasm
860,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ADLS1314,5.0,4.0,"If I had to point to one class in an area outside my profession and say ""This class changed my life,"" it would be Prof. Alcock's Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets, offered online on Coursera. The class had very structured assignments that were challenging and fun; the lectures interesting and hilarious. This is one class that I absolutely loved!"
861,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ADLS,5.0,1.0,Awesome Class and Professor!

864,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ARCHDLS,5.0,1.0,"I took her class online, and she was great. Clear, funny, and easy going. Even on the discussion board she was friendly and kind, and tried her hardest to respond o everyone. I did learn a lot from her class and I would jump at the chance to have a class by her again."
865,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ARCHDLS,5.0,1.0,"Great professor! I took a MOOC from her and it was the best online class I have ever taken. Interesting, engaging, informative. I UNDERSTAND instead of memorizing, I will never forget the things I learned in her class."
866,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ADLS,5.0,1.0,"She was a fascinating professor. She taught my class on Courseca. She puts so much effort into planning the class, not just doing the lessons herself, but bringing in others. Everyone should take her class. Its free, so their is nothing to lose."
867,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ARCHDLS,5.0,1.0,Prof. Alcock is amazing! If you get a chance - take a course with her!
868,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ARCH402,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Alcock is exceptional! Her presentation style is well organized, thoughtful, highly informative. She makes art and archeology in the ancient Greco-Roman world truly interesting!!"
869,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,ARCH770,4.5,1.0,"Alcock is an awesome lecturer and a really intelligent woman.  The TA Lyra Monteiro was very helpful and always available.  Loved the topics, loved the class!  A must-take"
870,936980,Susan,Alcock,Brown University,Classics,AE77,4.0,4.0,"Interesting, enthusiastic, fun teacher; makes the ancient world very accessible; only complaint was the picky TA who ended up doing a lot of the grading"
871,15395,Catherine,Imbriglio,Brown University,English,LYRICISMANDLU,5.0,3.0,"Catherine is the best writing teacher I've ever had at Brown. Her feedback is clear and specific. She's incredibly attuned to nuances in the language you use (in your writing). She exceeds every expectation in how much she cares about her students. Many years later, she remains a much loved mentor."
872,15395,Catherine,Imbriglio,Brown University,English,ENGL0110,5.0,4.0,"Very helpful, always provides feedback,and doesn't dominate classroom discussions, simply guides everyone to understand on their own."
873,15395,Catherine,Imbriglio,Brown University,English,LYRICISMLUCIDI,3.5,4.0,"Like most writing courses, you can make this course what you want/need it to be.  Don't worry about the clarity of the assignments...just read and write.  You'll be surprised at the results.  Somehow, she just pulls it out of you, if you're willing."
874,15395,Catherine,Imbriglio,Brown University,English,EL0011,4.0,4.0,"She is great!  She gave at least 2 or 3 pages of feedback on each of my papers, and really read all of my writing.  We had some great discussions in class, and she really challenged us as writers and people."
875,15395,Catherine,Imbriglio,Brown University,English,EL0011,4.5,3.0,"great lecturer and wonderful person!  she is so caring and genuinely loves teaching.  really does care about her class and its students.  if you can, try and take one of her classes, she's terrific."

He always leaves really nice comments on grading, he's very lenient with extensions and such. He even invited the class to his house for our last day and made us all hot cider and talked to us about life! The whole course was laid out before we started so it was super accessible."

894,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY0021,2.0,4.0,"Smart man, but a horrific professor. Be prepared for lots of reading, but limited application."
895,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS0710,5.0,1.0,"Laid-back, funny, and highly articulate. He is extremely pleasant to listen to and, even though he may appear more research-focused, he connects to the material personally. He is one of the most intelligent professors (I'm in STEM), and is humble about it. "
896,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY0021,3.5,2.0,"Really nice guy, lectures sometimes boring but the material was fun and for the most part a really easy class."
898,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,SOCIALPSYCH,4.0,3.0,"I liked him and found him attractive. I still remember what was taught and found it useful and interesting. Gave good examples and encouraged participations. I think the exams were demanding but fair, from what I recall."
899,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY21,4.0,3.0,"My friend and I thought he was sorta cute in that German taskmaster sort of way. He's actually a really laid-back, funny professor, but I'll acknowledge that lectures could be boring - and the tests were hideous. But the material is AMAZING. I think he helped write the book they use, so he knows it"
900,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY0021,4.0,2.0,Material was interesting and presented almost entirely through powerpoint slides provided by the textbook publisher.  His lectures clear and he kept my attention but often was unable to answer students ' questions (which is probably because there were no psych studies that provided an answer)
901,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY21,4.0,2.0,"Lectures consist of rambling and are sometimes incoherent.  It's really not that hard a class, and his accent and sense of humor take some adjusting to."
902,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY21,2.5,3.0,"The first day of class he said, ""Well, they're forcing me to teach this class for another year, so here I am."""
903,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY21,1.5,3.0,"seriously don't take py21 with him. i long for the day, for others, when he doesn't teach it anymore."
904,165504,Joachim,Krueger,Brown University,Psychology,PY21154,4.0,4.0,"he is really funny, if you get his sense of humor, although his lectures are kind of rambling. he's great if you talk to him personally."
906,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,COLT1813I,5.0,4.0,"Yes, her enthusiasm can be alienating at times. However, she's a total GENIUS, both as a teacher and as a scholar. She makes you work for the grade but you'll see the rewards in how much you learn and how much your writing improves. You'll be wiser and sharper after taking her class."
907,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,COLT,5.0,3.0,"Professor Merrim taught the first class I ever took at Brown, and she's set the bar really high for other teachers. Take her FYS! It's fun and you'll learn a lot!"
908,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,CO0142,5.0,3.0,great prof. very enthusiastic. very just.
910,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,CO71,4.0,3.0,"Yes, very enthusiast.   Unfortunately, this leads to her being distractingly spastic.  Her course was laid out very well and very clear- I learned a lot.  I just don't think I would enjoy having her again."
911,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,CO71,4.5,4.0,"Very (sometimes overly) ethusiastic. Very knowledgable. Sincerely interested in getting to know her students. She is also TOTALLY CRAZY- she's obsessed with her work to the point of blind giddiness. Her ethusiasm is sometimes overwhelming and alienating, but readings are good and she teaches well."
912,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,CO,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Merrim is incredibly kind, smart, helpful, and a wonderful teacher."
913,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,COMP,1.5,3.0,a nightmare...
914,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,COMPLIT,1.0,2.0,sucks. didn't learn a thing. and she's rude too.
915,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,SP,1.0,3.0,"worse prof i've ever had, when will she be fired, please?!?"
916,187717,Stephanie,Merrim,Brown University,English,CO0181,5.0,2.0,"Besides being one of the nicest ladies I've met in a while, Professor Merrim is also really concerned and compassionate.  She has such a high level of enthusiasm in teaching and loves to work with students.  She is worth getting to know."
917,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,3.5,2.0,"Professor Rose-Petruck was wonderful! He always makes himself available for office hours- so you should definitely make it appoint to go and ask questions! Exams and problem sets are very helpful and not too difficult... the hardest part is the grading (make sure you include UNITS!). Oh, and the textbook will become your best friend!"
918,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CHEM0330,3.0,4.0,Doesn't do enough examples in class
919,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CH01,4.5,3.0,"Cares a great deal about his students. Honestly loves chemistry and wants his students to, at the very least, enjoy the subject and understand it. Doesn't consider his class a pre-med weed-out class but actually wants to teach."
920,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,2.0,2.0,"He covers material very slowly, and does an okay job explaining things. Tests and problem sets were not very difficult, and he is a very nice person."
922,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,3.0,2.0,Not a particularly good lecturer. Coursework is mild.
924,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,5.0,2.0,reaaly nice and good at explaining principles.
925,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,3.0,2.0,"The easiest of the chem33 profs, if you're looking for a hardcore chem section take Stratt, if you're just satisfying prereqs then this is the section to be in."
926,257661,Christoph,Rose-Petruck,Brown University,Chemistry,CH33,2.5,1.0,"Austrian accent is amusing.  Spends time on deriving equations when he won't expect us to know how to derive them.  Little to no application done in class.  I thought I would be confused, but then I realized I was making it harder. He's a nice guy."
928,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HIAAS01,1.0,5.0,"Stubborn, moody, uncompromising. I never had a teacher as cold as Muller. Definitely avoid this guy. Taking his class was the worst experience I had at Brown. The way he grades is also quite unpredictable."
929,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HA62,1.0,5.0,"uncompromising, never want to take art history again."
930,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HISTART,1.5,3.0,"This man is a skull that thinks something is inside it. Moody, bigheaded- could hold several collections inside that thing. Dusty seeming. Tragic."
932,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HA60,5.0,4.0,I LOVE HIM! hes amazing and totally brillant.  you learn a lot in his classes
933,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HA62,2.0,4.0,"Just terrible.  Mean, cranky, condescending"
934,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HA62,3.0,4.0,"Just terrible.  Mean, cranky, condescending"
935,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HA62,1.0,1.0,"mean spirited, negative, full of himself"
937,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HA0001,5.0,3.0,"Muller is a great lecturer - he's funny and engaging, and he really knows his stuff."
938,265947,J,Muller,Brown University,History In Art,HA0001,4.5,2.0,Hes very animated about the class which is good but gets caught up in hearing his own voice so he can kind of go on and on in lecture.  very accesible to questions
939,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SOC1010,3.0,5.0,"He was very good in lecture though the grading for the course was only based on midterm and final (four papers - we had one week to write each pair). Good, but I feel like focused too much on some sociologists like Durkheim and Marx, while others such as Weber and DuBois we barely spent more than 3 classes working on them."
940,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SC150,2.0,2.0,"He repeated everything!  Only do the readings after the exams are assigned- there are some that are totally useless.  I'm so glad this class is over, I could barely sit through the lectures.  He seem like a great guy, just too unorganized to lecture."
941,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,AF9,4.0,1.0,"Not hot appearance wise, but his class was.  He is incredibly smart and knows his stuff.  I'm so glad I got to take a class with him."
942,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SOC15,4.0,2.0,"It is very easy to get lost in his lectures, ,at the same time he is a very fun professor to listen to. The topics discussed are interesting, the class is overall easy especially if you go to class."
943,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SO15,3.0,1.0,Paget is clear in the sense that he often repeats himself and speaks in a slow slow Caribbean accent. The dialect is hard to understand. This is a gut. I barely read. Needed discussion section. Henry seems very enthusiastic and approachable but didn't give a damn about this class. Always late.
944,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SO15,3.0,1.0,"He was very easy for this class, and only had two assignments, which made grading easier for him and the TAs I'm sure.  Material was interesting, but I didn't feel he did it justice.  I've heard from others that he's an good africanist, but a horrible sociologist."
945,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SOC,1.0,1.0,He just repeats everything form the readings and tries to put on a show.  I'm not impressed.
946,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,AF9SO15,5.0,2.0,LOVE HIM!! his classes are interesting and he's hilarious.
947,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SO15,1.5,2.0,"only 2 graded assignments all year.  guess that's good, unless he screws you over in grading one of them.  Lectures rehash the dry readings.  Really dont see why rater 1 and 2 really like the guy, he's mediocre-&gt;avg"
948,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SO15,5.0,2.0,Amazing class. Amazing prof.
949,325565,Henry,Paget,Brown University,Sociology,SO15,4.5,2.0,"The dude's an ex-reggae ma. Awesome fun, cool class, funny guy."
950,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,COLT1210,4.0,4.0,"Professor Bernstein taught literary theory with Professor Sng.  I found her lectures informative, if a little dry.  She cracked a joke occasionally which was nice.  I think she is most likely an excellent professor teaching a dreadful subject.  Literary theory was mandatory for my major, and let's just say that I am glad it is over. "
951,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,COLT1210,4.0,4.0,"Yes, Prof Bernstein is intimidating. She's also extremely knowledgeable, has always been helpful and friendly in office hours, and seems genuinely pleased whenever a student shows enthusiasm or interest in the subject matter. I think there's a lot to admire in Prof Bernstein; she certainly motivated me to do my best."
952,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO121,2.0,3.0,"Professor Bernstein was unhelpful and biased towards certain students who sucked up (I once waited outside office hours for 1.5 hours to then be dismissed) Having been taught theory by others in the department, I found her approach inflexible and anachronistic. It isn't enough to toe the line but one must kowtow to her ""awesome"" intellect. Avoid!"
953,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,COLT121,4.5,4.0,"Teaches difficult stuff, but has a genuine interest and encourages exploration.  Very helpful. Love her approach."
954,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO121,3.5,4.0,"I really liked her.  Never had a problem getting in touch with her via email.  Found her lectures and sections interesting, enlightening, thorough and just complicated enough.  Not an easy A, but well worth it."
955,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Bernstein is put in the unfortunate position of teaching a new approach to reading a text, as well as some complicated theory. This is not easy or intuitive material and students who are used to an easy A don't take kindly to this.  For those who are confused, she offers thoughtful advice in office hours, which beats e-mail any time."
956,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO0121,1.0,3.0,i agree with other co0121 student. she was very unhelpful and it seemed like she just didn't care. maybe we're looking at two different people because i don't get the hot factor either.
957,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO161,4.5,5.0,"She teaches hard stuff, yes, and she does it with great deftness - i would also say wit and maybe grace.  One of the finest teachers of my time here at Brown.  And pretty bad-ass, too."
958,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO0121,1.5,4.0,unresponsive to emails and questions after class. my enthusiasm has taken a nose dive because it's clear she's not interested in passing along her knowledge but just cashing her paycheck.
959,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO0161,4.5,5.0,"VERY challenging course, but in a good way. There is a ton of reading, and it is heavy serious stuff - probably would be considered a graduate level class by most standards. She is an excellent teacher, with a cool dry sense of humor."
960,364175,Susan,Bernstein,Brown University,Literature,CO0161,4.0,4.0,"Professor Bernstein's awesome, but incredibly difficult.  The truth is she's not really very clear, but that's more because of the subject matter (literary theory) and there's no category for fascinating, so I weighted the other two."
962,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,APMA330,5.0,2.0,"If you want an A, you can get an A. He tells all the exam questions beforehand, if you're worried about your grade you can ask him and he'll give you extra credit. Literally the only STEM class I've gotten an A in at Brown is Diff Eq with Dobrushkin, and the cutoff for an A was a 92. He tells funny stories and is quite a character. Big fan."
963,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,AM0330,3.5,4.0,"Unlike all the other posters, in my section he had a very strict curve of 93.5 and above = A... naturally I got a 92.5, argh."
964,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,AM34,4.5,2.0,Easy A!
965,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,MTH108,4.5,1.0,"I had Professor Dobrushkin for a semester across town at Providence College.  He is a very nice man, clear, concise, and makes the tests as straightforward as he can."
966,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,AM3334,2.5,2.0,"The question is whether you have learned something from the class, or you just want to get an A? I am sure that Dobrushkin loves to give an A to students he likes! He makes the class easy because he'll let you know what will be on the exam."
967,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,AM0033AM0034,4.0,1.0,"My ? is: what's his basis on ""liking you or not liking you""? In any case, I think he's a great guy, if you showed the effort, you got an A. That's how all classes should be :o)"
968,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,AM33,5.0,1.0,He wants you to get an A.
970,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,AM33,1.0,3.0,"Tremendously unfair person, he should be ashamed of himself for putting such a bad attitude into his courses.  Hes a very bad teacher as well.  There is no reason he should be a professor.  NONE."
972,399857,Vladimir,Dobrushkin,Brown University,Mathematics,AM33SEC2,1.5,4.0,"Don't take his courses. He is very unfair in grading and very bias. If he likes you, then you're all set. If he doesn't like you, then he'll give you a bad grade, even your answer is correct. I had a real bad experience with his attitude."
974,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,NEUR0010,5.0,3.0,His diagrams are amazing and make neural systems incredibly understandable! I highly recommend NEUR0010!!
975,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,NEUR0010,4.0,2.0,He's kewl
976,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,NEUR01,4.0,2.0,"Great lecturer. Both Stein and Paradiso know what they're talking about and are eager to make you understand it, too. On the bad side, his handwriting can be tedious to read so be sure to get the slides after class!"
977,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,NEUR0010,4.0,3.0,"Professor Paradiso is an amazing lecturer.  His most popular course is NEUR0010 (The Brain: An Intro to Neuroscience), which he co-teaches with Professor John Stein.  The class is very fun and interesting and both professors are wonderful.  It's a must take!"
978,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,NEURO0100,3.5,4.0,"In my opinion, a better lecturer than Stein. Engaging and writes most pertinent information down on slides that can be accessed online."
979,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,NEUR0100,4.5,3.0,I love this guy! His lecture style is easy to follow and he is strangely adorable in a middle aged man kind of way.  I liked him a lot.  Be careful though-- his handwriting can be hard to read!
980,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,NEUR0100,4.5,5.0,His teaching style is really easy to follow and helpful.
981,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,BN01,4.5,4.0,The best lecturer I have yet encountered.  Extremely personable- never hesitate to go up and ask a question afterward
982,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,BN0001,5.0,3.0,Great lecturer. He makes neuro organized and easy to understand
984,507148,Michael,Paradiso,Brown University,Biology,BN1,4.5,4.0,"Great lecturer, really organized.  Take this class!"
986,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGL1010,5.0,4.0,Professor Villa-Ignacio is a fabulous Professor and I feel as though my writing truly improved and it became easier to write. She is so understanding and a great help during office hours and essay appointments.
987,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGL1010,5.0,3.0,"Taking this class will turn you into a very effective researcher and writer, and for me, it brought up my grades outside the course, as well. She breaks essay-writing down into concrete steps and gives you all the tools you need to succeed. Always available to help, and very understanding when it comes to extensions.. Great class!"
988,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGLISH1010,4.5,4.0,"I genuinely appreciated the rigor of the class, because although I found it difficult. Professor Villa-Ignacio was more than available for one on  ones. Her feedback was really insightful and I felt as if I left the class a better writer. She also picked amazing and unconventional topics to discuss which definitely made writing more interesting. "
989,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGLISH1010,4.5,3.0,"After taking Professor Villa Ignacio's class,  I feel I have really grown as a writer.  If you go to her office hours, Professor Villa Ignacio is more than happy to help and gives you great insight into how to improve your papers."
990,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGL1010,4.5,3.0,Professor Ignacio was awesome!  Her class is definitely interesting-the books we read were unlike any I was exposed to in high school. Essays and assignments are vary in style and expectation which really helps with writing for other classes. The work is manageable and office hours are incredibly helpful (go to them) !!!! Loved this class!
991,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGL1010,1.5,5.0,"she is extremely strict, assigns way to much work to be capable of doing, assigns work over holidays, vacations and weekends, and assigns homework on top of essays. AKA there is a lot of work and she is very unclear about assignments so you need to be pretty reliant on her website and your own independence."
992,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGLISH1010,3.0,4.0,"Definitely a good teacher, but she's just not a great person. Probably the most condescending teacherprofessor I've ever had. The work load for her freshman class is ridiculous. If you can, avoid taking the class, the mental scars are not worth it."
993,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGLISH1010,1.0,5.0,"Had her class for freshman english and it was the hardest class I took that semester. I consider myself a good writer, receiving mostly A's in high school, but I never received above an 80% on my papers. I tried going to her for help but it never made a difference in my grades. Additionally, she picked the most obscure novels for us to read."
994,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGLISH1010,2.5,4.0,Never clear what she is asking for. Tough grader. Not an easy course.
995,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,ENGLISH1010,2.5,4.0,One of the most condescending people I've had the misfortune to encounter. Makes it up as she goes along. Not interested in what the students have to say.
996,647600,Teresa,Villa-Ignacio,Brown University,Literature,CO181,5.0,3.0,Teresa is the best!
997,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,COLT0510F,3.0,3.0,"Professor Whitfield clearly knew and cared a great deal about the course, however she could have facilitated more discussions during class. She felt the need to respond to each student's comment, which was often unnecessary and broke up debates. Grading was only released twice (once for the midterm and then for the final) and was not helpful al all"
998,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,COLT,5.0,1.0,"Best professor at Brown. Engages with students, receptive in office hours, very bright."
999,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,CO181,5.0,4.0,Professor Whitfield is always well prepared and engaging in class and a great help during her office hours. She chooses compelling material for her classes and takes more time in identifying the pertinent parts of the texts than many other professors do. She is excellent at sparking and guiding student discussion -- she is a great professor!
1000,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,COMP1810,4.5,2.0,"Tale of Two cities is highly recomended! She is so engaging and understanding. Lectures are always well planned and interesting, but texts are sometimes boring (but not too long)"
1001,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,CO81,3.5,1.0,"Young and eager.  I agree she is overly affirming, however at least she conducts classes in such a way that one never feels scared to speak up (I was a freshman when I took this class).  Her interest in her subject is obvious."
1002,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,CO81,5.0,3.0,great
1003,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,CO51CO81,4.0,3.0,"Great range in readings, good ideas presented in lecture, very friendly and enthusiastic. Only qualm is- she's still young and a little unsure of herself. Sometimes her lectures are a little TOO nervous and high energy. She can be overly affirming-- says YES to ANY comment in discussion."
1004,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,CO143,5.0,3.0,I love Professor Whitfield.  She is so knowledgeable and communicates themes and analysis very well.  She is also not afraid to explore new books or new views in her courses.  Her grading is fair and visiting her in office hours helps a lot.  She also writes great recommendations.
1005,156842,Esther,Whitfield,Brown University,Literature,CO81,4.0,3.0,very nice and easy to talk to.

1009,165506,Phil,Brown,Brown University,Sociology,SO30,4.5,3.0,Prof. Brown is a very engaged and personable teacher.  He is very passionate about the environment and has a great wealth of knowledge to share.
1010,165506,Phil,Brown,Brown University,Sociology,SO30,5.0,3.0,Professor Brown is very passionate about Environmental Justice and his personal interest spilled over onto the rest of the class.  The work was manageable and worth while...I would recommend this class to everyone!
1011,165506,Phil,Brown,Brown University,Sociology,SOC30,5.0,2.0,He is a great teacher.  Talked the class if you have the chance.

1017,298116,Akio,Yasuhara,Brown University,Economics,ECON172,1.0,4.0,"Awful professor. Too much focus on theory over practice, no interest in student concerns, and incredibly monotonous teaching style. Take the course with Welch instead."

Voice is hard to listen to. Midterm + final are NOT easy just b/c you did the HW. Scheduled impossible final at 9AM."

He is a poor lecturer, does not treat people who ask him questions well and gives alot of work that he is a jerk about about....PS he doesn't curve his tests and those homeworks are near impossible.....enjoy!"
1027,483154,Dan,Abramovich,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH0100,5.0,3.0,"Enthusiastic about the subject, has comprehensive class notes, and is really helpful outside of class (He has office hours 3 times a week!)! I don't know why you wouldn't like him - he is really wonderful."

1030,483154,Dan,Abramovich,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH251,5.0,4.0,"Abramovich is one of the best professors I've ever had. Most of the other raters had him for freshman calculus...I can see that this might not be his best subject. But when teaching abstract algebra, he is enthusiastic, engaging, entertaining, and extremely clear."
1031,483154,Dan,Abramovich,Brown University,Mathematics,MA18,1.0,5.0,"He is difficult to understand, and not approachable for help."
1033,483154,Dan,Abramovich,Brown University,Mathematics,MA18,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor or teacher Ive ever had, back to preschool. Do not bother going to class, as you will learn nothing. He has a Good Will Hunting complex where he obviously thinks he's far too brilliant tbe teaching this class, and as a result he spends classtime amusing himself and explaining nothing"
1034,483154,Dan,Abramovich,Brown University,Mathematics,153,1.0,5.0,I was very scared he is a real perv
1035,483154,Dan,Abramovich,Brown University,Mathematics,MA153,1.5,5.0,"Very unclear; talks like a textbook. Rarely shows up for his skimpy office hours, and assigns homework about stuff he hasn't talked about at all."
1037,543654,Annie,Wiart,Brown University,Languages,FR0151,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I have ever had. Hands down. She loves her subject and doesn't just want her students to learn, she wants them to love it as much as she does. Energetic, hilarious, kind, responsive, not to mention BRILLANT - the woman is a mine of information and she knows how to teach it. Beg, borrow or steal a place in this course."
1038,543654,Annie,Wiart,Brown University,Languages,FREN100,5.0,4.0,My favorite professor at Brown so far. Never had a better experience.
1039,543654,Annie,Wiart,Brown University,Languages,FR0151,5.0,3.0,"The best professor I've ever had - she's excited about what's she's teaching and she wants you to love it just as much. She's extremely helpful, cheerful, very open, and clear with her explanations. I want to be her!!"
1040,543654,Annie,Wiart,Brown University,Languages,FR0060,5.0,4.0,Great at organizing class activity. nice usage of small class size and pays great attention to students' interests. One of the best prof at brown that i had.
1041,543654,Annie,Wiart,Brown University,Languages,FREN151,5.0,4.0,Annie is truly a ray of sunshine.  She will present a topic that is impossible to answer and sit there and encourage her students to dive right in. She is truly an angel. Sweetest prof at Brown.
1042,543654,Annie,Wiart,Brown University,Languages,FR60,5.0,4.0,"Mme Wiart, Chere Wiart, you rock in all languages. I loved your class. Runs a solid discussion, a great woman. Take her."

1048,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0530,5.0,4.0,"Indubitably the best Biology Professor at Brown. For every topic he teacheseven the intricate and complicated onesDr. B derives a means to ensure the content is interesting, awe-inducing, and easily digestible. And above all, he loves teaching. A true guru who strives for his students' progress and well-being."
1049,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0530,5.0,3.0,"If you ever have a chance to take a class with Dr. B DO IT!!! His teaching method relates incredibly specific components of complicated systems by relating them to pop culture (he is proudly nerdy) and making the material actually understandable, not just repeating the textbook (which he doesn't even make you buy because it's really expensive)A Gem"
1050,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0530,5.0,4.0,Highly passionate and deeply cares about his students. Highly recommend his class!
1051,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0530,4.5,4.0,"Absolutely amazing professor, he really cares about his students and has a passion for immunology that can be contagious."
1052,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIO0530,5.0,4.0,Fantastic lecturer.  Would highly recommend his classes.  He does a fantastic job of making students apply the information that they've memorized to solve interesting and novel problems related to the topic of study.  Thoroughly enjoyable classes.  He also cares deeply for all of his students.
1053,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIO1600,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Bungiro is one of Brown's best! He's a genuine person, and truly cares about his students and their learning. His lectures are interesting, clear,  and to the point! He's quirky, which makes learning cell-molecular Biology and immunology a whole lot better! I would HIGHLY recommend taking a course with Dr. B!"
1054,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0530,5.0,4.0,"Awesome lecturer, totally there for you, has very available office hours and wants everyone to succeed."
1055,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL1600,2.5,4.0,"Easily the most overly-hyped professor at Brown. I took his vaccins course, and he taught the material well, but there was absolutely NO outside support given, at least when I asked for it. I think that once professors get such a good reputation, they start to care less about their students. He rarely responded to my emails, I don't recommend him. "
1056,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0530,5.0,2.0,"The absolute best professor at Brown. Period. He is a gifted, entertaining, warm and friendly professor. He is a great mentor outside of the classroom and gives 110% for his students. I have never met a professor more involved with and interested with his students. He renewed my passion for biology and science."
1057,1893319,Richard,Bungiro,Brown University,Biology,BIOL0510B,4.5,2.0,Bungiro is hilarious and makes class very interesting. This is the second course I've taken with him and he has not failed to make his lectures engaging with plenty of cultural references and jokes!
1058,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,HIST1290,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Harris is quite possibly my favorite professor at Brown- he is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable, has the best 'British' sense of humor that comes out in every lecture and is so helpful to students. Take any class with him, as long as you are willing to put in a reasonable amount, though certainly not excessive, of work."
1059,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,HIST135,4.5,4.0,"Ignited my interest in history.  Fantastic professor.  Demands a lot, but really is fair.  If you do the work, you'll do well."
1060,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,HI128,5.0,4.0,"Hilariously funny, really interesting and engaging.  Pushes you hard, but the results are worth it.  Great section leader too."
1061,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,HI197,5.0,3.0,Outstanding professor. Highly recommended.
1062,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,HI0128,5.0,4.0,This professor is amazing! He's really funny but you learn so much in the class!
1063,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,BRITISHHISTORY,5.0,4.0,Harris is a very open and affectionate yet challenging and rigorous instructor. Loves to argue and doesn't mind being contradicted. Nuttily obsessed with England.
1065,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,HI129,3.0,4.0,"jumps into course without explaining anything that happened before, just expects you to know."
1066,10402,Timothy,Harris,Brown University,History,HI129,4.0,3.0,"Great lecturer...Tough grader, though."
1067,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,ANTH,3.5,2.0,"Knows his stuff.His mind is like a library of information in his field.He is also very open and caring about your work and wants to make sure students do the best work they can. He's not out to get you with tricky test questions, he genuinely wants you understand the material. He seemed a little shy,but once you get over that he will help you alot."
1068,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,AN121,3.0,3.0,"also would have to say, a very boring class taught by a very nice man."
1069,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,AN50,2.0,4.0,Painfully boring class taught by a nice man.
1070,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,AN0110,4.5,3.0,"I actually liked Prof. Anderson a lot. He is kind of this friendly lovable guy with lots of stories. The reading is long, but I don't think he expects us to get anything more then a general overview of the material. And a great guy, or so it seems."
1071,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,AN110,2.5,4.0,"ugh...  too much reading!  really nice and interesting, but the class has too many vague and lengthy assignments that are really hard to place in context.  good for anthro concentrators, i guess."
1072,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,AN0050,2.5,3.0,This is the most painfully boring class I've ever taken. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you have to for the anthro concentration.
1074,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,AN,2.0,3.0,not so good....
1075,119231,Douglas,Anderson,Brown University,Anthropology,AN50,2.5,3.0,"intro to archaeology sounds easy, but it really involves tons of memorization of sites, bones and neanderthals! you have to be really interested or an anthro concentrator to take it (it's required)..."
1077,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH2260,5.0,3.0,"Best math professor I've had. Lectures and thinks at a high level of abstraction, and is clearly passionate about the material."
1078,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,4.0,Does not make sense.
1079,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH0350,4.0,4.0,Legend. Very quotable
1080,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MA18,5.0,1.0,my fave
1081,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,5.0,"Incomprehensible, gave exercises so difficult that the TA couldn't make them. Asked many questions the first few weeks but soon gave up.."
1082,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MATH10,1.0,3.0,"difficult to understand, does not answer questions to satisfaction of students, does not really teach to the needs of students"
1084,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MA8,1.5,4.0,"He was a horrible professor.  He didn't make himself clear at all, and no one in class understood what he was talking about, time and time again."
1085,177363,Brian,Cole,Brown University,Mathematics,MA112,1.0,3.0,"He's completely detached from the class and doesn't make any connection with the students at all.  He also goes very fast, has bad handwriting, and answers questions poorly."
1086,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JA01,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Yuko Jackson is one of the kindest and most motherly of educators, not to mention her obvious wealth of experience in teaching Japanese. She is clear in her teaching, using examples to elucidate grammatical points and utilises unconventional tools such as fun websites and music to liven up the class. Most of all,she is caring and approachable"
1087,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JAPN80,5.0,3.0,"Imoto-sensei is one of few teachers I've met who absolutely refuses to give up on students. even after studying in japan, I still have a lot of work to do, and she goes above and beyond to push me to be better. If you're serious about Japanese, you won't regret taking one of her classes. She makes it a lot of fun and always listens to suggestions!"
1088,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JA80,4.5,2.0,"Imoto Sensei is a wonderful advanced Japanese professor. If you want deep analysis -- and a helpful understanding, then she is the sensei for you. If you are having trouble understanding something, she will teach you how to understand it. I have never before had a professor as available to help me with such patience until i could finally speak Jap."
1089,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JA80,5.0,4.0,"Imoto-sensei is awesomeness. Seriously, she is the reason why my Japanese is still alive and kicking. She's really funny and always helpful. :)"
1090,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JAPS01,5.0,4.0,"Professor Imoto is very dedicated and enthusiastic about teaching Japanese. Oftentimes her humor lights up the atmosphere in the classroom. She also takes into heart the progress of each student and is always available for help. Imoto sensei is a wonderful teacher, I enjoyed taking her classes and will definitely recommend them to other students."
1091,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JAPANESE,1.0,3.0,"STAY AWAY FROM HER!!  Easily one of the worst teachers at Brown, also one of the worst people.  If you want to take japanese, take a class with wilkner or tajima or yamashita instead"
1092,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JA5070,1.0,2.0,"She is maybe an average teacher, a little bit on the boring side.  BUT I don't think she's a very good person.  Intimidation does not facilitate learning.  I would stay away from any class she's teaching as she is obsessed with power and manipulating people."
1093,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JA5070,2.0,3.0,"Ok. so she's a pretty good teacher when it comes to *just* Japanese.  but as said above, she hides this evil interior and will often single students out or adjust the way things are done in the japanese depratment just to display and exert her ""power"
1094,193384,Yuko,Jackson,Brown University,Languages,JAPANESE,4.0,3.0,"she is pretty clear and organized.  she tries very hard to be nice to her students in class.  i'm not sure if she really has a nice heart though.  i always thought she was a bit scary and sarcastic.  but i do admit, you do learn in her classes."
1095,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,BWS111,2.0,3.0,"Lauren Sarat has a(narrow) specific p.o.v. about what constitutes good writing. If you are not within the scope of her interests, there is not much to learn. Her detached and distracted presence conveys that she clearly is at the end of the line with her teaching."
1096,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,NONFI1111,4.5,2.0,"She's clear about what she wants, and she makes class fun. Though make sure that you can take criticism. She can lay it on you."
1097,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,ENGL0180,4.0,4.0,"The first few weeks, you'll probably hate her and think she's overly harsh and critical-- which she kind of is.  I almost didn't stay in her class based on the first impression I got from her.  But I am so glad that I did, because she turned out to be one of the most helpful and involved teachers I have had at Brown.  Truly an awesome woman."
1098,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,ENGL0180,4.0,4.0,"One day, she realized that we all looked stressed out so instead of doing the usual work, she led the class in meditation. She's tough and intimidating sometimes, but she's funny and cares about her students."

1100,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,ELL0018,2.5,3.0,"Very self-involved and self-indulgent.  Can be quite condescending.  On the up side, she is a clear lecturer, if a bit basic."
1101,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,EL18,4.5,2.0,She's a good intro teacher
1102,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,EL18,4.0,2.0,"She's a little big-headed but brilliant, very well spoken and gives great suggestions in writing.  It's a hard class to teach, but she's well spoken and her ideas are well thought out.  I liked her."
1103,242064,Lauren,Sarat,Brown University,English,EL18,1.0,3.0,"The worst discussion leader I've ever experienced. She interrupts students, makes inappropriate comments, and insists on responding to each student's statements making it impossible for a fluid discussion to occur.  Inflexible and unreasonable."
1105,321775,Michael,Vorenberg,Brown University,History,HIST1740,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors at Brown. Universally well-respected, kind, inspiring, incredibly intelligent. I looked forward to Professor Vorenberg's lectures and he gave excellent feedback on papers. He pushes you to do your best work, and an A from him is very gratifying."

1107,321775,Michael,Vorenberg,Brown University,History,HIST1740,5.0,4.0,"Civil War is an awesome class. Lectures are always well structured and engaging, and Vorenberg is extremely helpful outside of class, especially with the research paper. He encourages you to think critically and originally, and presents history as an exciting and ever-changing discipline. Great prof and great class."
1108,321775,Michael,Vorenberg,Brown University,History,HI171,5.0,3.0,"American Legal and Constitutional History.  FANTASTIC course and the best, most engaging professor I had at Brown.  So generous with his time and passionate about his material.   His views are a little left, but he acknowledges this upfront and never lets it influence his dissemination of the material, which is rare in a history course."
1109,321775,Michael,Vorenberg,Brown University,History,CIVILWAR,3.0,3.0,"He is a pretty good lecturer and manages to make even boring things interesting, but his TA's really detract from the class."
1110,321775,Michael,Vorenberg,Brown University,History,HI174,5.0,3.0,He is by far the best lecturer I've had at Brown.

1114,373610,James,Valles,Brown University,Physics,PHYS7,2.0,5.0,"His way of teaching is not meant for those who need explanation to understand. He teaches by simple statement rather than answering the looming questions of ""why?"""

1117,373610,James,Valles,Brown University,Physics,PHYS7,5.0,5.0,"Extremely difficult class, taught by an extremely helpful professor. If I had to describe him, I'd say Bill Nye for college students. The study sessions he had multiple times every week were extremely helpful, and he'd make sure you had someone to work with. Plus, very personable."
1120,373610,James,Valles,Brown University,Physics,PH47,5.0,2.0,"He's definitely the best physics professor at Brown, by far.  He really makes you appreciate colored chalk like nobody else can."
1122,373610,James,Valles,Brown University,Physics,PH47,5.0,3.0,"Probably the best professor at Brown.  He makes you work, but when you finish you know the material by heart, forever.  Funny, sincere, sharp- he is a testiment to amazing teaching."

1124,474906,Hilary,Silver,Brown University,Sociology,URBN0210,2.0,2.0,"It was pretty evident that all the grading was done by the TA, whom she seemed to put a lot of work on. The syllabus was packed with readings that were not always touched on, and her lectures were often unorganized, which made things confusing. However, information was interesting and grading was relatively easy."

1126,474906,Hilary,Silver,Brown University,Sociology,SO101,2.5,2.0,A lot of reading and a pretty monotonous approach to this class. Her lectures were decent but I strongly disliked her use of slides and having a midterm and final jammed with questions.
1127,474906,Hilary,Silver,Brown University,Sociology,US0021,1.5,1.0,"she's really moody and seems to care nothing about the class.  very uninvolved and not a great lecturer (TA was a better teacher!).  could have been a cool class, but very disappointed with it.  only take this if you are SURE you're going major in Urban Studies, otherwise it's a waste of time.  some good readings on syllabus, but volume overwhelms."

1132,551403,Coppelia,Kahn,Brown University,English,ENGL0400A,4.5,4.0,"I hate Shakespeare, and Prof. Kahn got me to enjoy it. Certainly not the easiest of teachers, but if you want a professor whose comments and help will improve your writing, she's definitely it. Great section leader. A bit hard-shelled but a lovely person."
1133,551403,Coppelia,Kahn,Brown University,English,ENGL1310,4.5,3.0,"Professor Kahn is by no means the easiest teacher in the Eng dept, but she is definitely one of the most knowledgeable. Take a seminar with her -- lectures are amazing and she gives time for discussion. It won't be an easy A but there's not a ton of work and your writing will improve so much. Her paper comments are critical, but usually spot-on."

1139,551403,Coppelia,Kahn,Brown University,English,EN0030,3.5,3.0,"The class is good, but often the lectures are useless. The sections are good though."
1140,551403,Coppelia,Kahn,Brown University,English,EL136,4.0,4.0,Prof. Kahn knows her****t.  Take this course to learn about Shakespeare and his contemporaries from a master.  But be prepared for some critical feedback on your papers.
1141,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,ENG112,2.0,5.0,.
1142,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,ARTS001B,4.5,4.0,Lisa is a great professor. She knows how to get students motivated and clearly cares for their progress. She will only get upset with you if she knows you can do better and are simply not putting in the work. She is a nice person and really amusing to be taught by!
1143,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,ENGL112,4.0,2.0,good teacher. seems harsh at first but she'll work you to excellence
1144,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,ENGL112,4.5,3.0,"Nice teacher, good atmosphere, pushes you to work hard. good education for the future!"
1145,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,ENGL112,4.5,3.0,Although she may seem harsh sometimes sometimes (grade-wise) she's a really warm and nice teacher. She pushes you to work hard and learn proper rhetoric. She lets you off the hook sometimes when your going through troubled times.
1146,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,ENG112,2.0,4.0,only take her class if you intend to go through hell
1148,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,EL0020,5.0,4.0,"Lisa was a great teacher, she pointed me to the right resources and pushed me to be a better writer."
1149,603712,Lisa,Brocklebank,Brown University,English,EL20,4.5,2.0,"Great class, easy, interesting, with a nice professor."
1150,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RELS0110,3.0,4.0,"Her beginner courses are just as difficult as her most advanced courses, there was as much work in her introductory course as I had for a graduate seminar in the same field. The lectures are interesting, but scattered, and she struggles to separate her own religious viewpoints from the material. Very kind and accessible for feedback."
1151,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RELS410,5.0,3.0,"Probably the best, or one of the best, teachers I have ever had in any discipline. Gives you a lot of work but makes you want to do it all and grades fairly. A GIFTED lecturer...turns class into an emotional experience. You will laugh, you will cry, you will learn. Never has history or philosophy/theology been made so alive for me. TAKE HER CLASS."
1152,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RELS401,3.0,3.0,Nice lady who seems to help those she feels sorry for more than others so that's a bummer if you need some help but aren't pitiable.  Can be interesting and that is what a student lives for. Alot of reading so you need to set aside a lot of time for her clss.
1153,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RELS0410,4.0,2.0,"She is brilliant and a very personable, humorous, an dynamic lecturer.  I loved taking class with her, she's a sweetheart!  My only complant was that she gave a lot of superfluous reading, but honestly it's not all necessary (although it's all interesting if you have the time.)"
1154,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RELS410,5.0,1.0,"Best professor I've ever had-- reliably mind-blowing lectures, she's a natural storyteller and poetic and funny.  She makes it come a live and I walk out of lectures ready to go and live as a  monk or whatever we studied that day because she gets inside their minds and theology so well.  Also uses slides properly-- just for background pictures."
1155,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RS72,4.5,3.0,She has a quiet intensity that gets under your skin.
1156,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RS9,4.5,2.0,"Amazing lectures, SO interesting.  She does give lots of reading, but you don't have to read everything to do well in her class, and all of it was interesting anyway.  Great professor."
1157,706807,Susan,Harvey,Brown University,Religion,RS72,5.0,3.0,AMAZING. TAKE ANYTHING SHE TEACHES. Her lectures are incredible; you will be riveted from the time you sit down until the time the class ends. The readings can be heavy at times but you don't really need to do them to do well on her exams.
1160,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,STRT230,4.0,3.0,No homework except presentations. He's super chill and interesting but so cocky. Interesting class but you will only do well if you participate a ton. Never used textbook once
1161,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,STRAT255,4.0,3.0,"I took Professor's Brennan's Moral Foundations of Market Society course to satisfy my ethics requirement. Not a bad way to go, Brennan himself is pretty arrogant but a good lecturer. Topics were definitely more interesting than intro to ethics. The ethics group project was a pain, but  he reads drafts of papers and gives good feedback."
1162,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,PHIL2180,5.0,3.0,"Just plain great, as always."
1163,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,PHIL500,5.0,3.0,"OP has it wrong.  Lots of discussion in this class despite size.  We need TAs, but that's the economy's fault that there's no funding.  Brennan is great--I will take more classes from him."
1164,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,PHIL500,5.0,4.0,Excellent class.  Changed my mind about what philosophy is supposed to be.  Needs discussion sections and TAs.  The guy who wrote the mean comment below probably only comes to class once a month.
1165,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,PHIL500,4.5,3.0,This class would rule if only the other students in it weren't so stupid.
1166,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,PHIL500,3.0,4.0,"From taking Moral Philosophy and reading some of his work, Jason Brennan is not a good Professor, and doesn't seem to be a good philsopher either. These are strong claims, but I don't expect 350 characters to establish this. His lectures are redundant and stick to the readings, which would be fine, but he does not facilitate discussion."
1167,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,PHIL500,5.0,4.0,"Amazing job teaching a tough, esoteric subject.  Jokes are usually good, too."
1168,940055,Jason,Brennan,Brown University,Political Science,PS82,4.5,4.0,Really passionate about material.  Class was hard.  Lots of writing.  Very respectful of different views.  Great class.  I learned a lot!
1169,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS0700,2.5,2.0,"Horrific experience taking this class. Professor Malle and his TAs are incredibly unorganized; multiple times they promised to have assignments graded by a certain date and missed their own promised deadlines. I understand it's a 300 person lecture class, but taking nearly a month to grade a one page paper is absurd."
1170,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS0700,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor - makes the material easy to grasp. Entertaining lectures. Response papers were tricky, but he gives you time to improve. Exams were fair. "
1171,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,PSYCHCLPS,4.5,3.0,I love Professor Malle. He's funny and friendly and he makes everything make sense. He takes time to answer questions and he makes the material relevant with anecdotes. He looks out for your best interests and is understanding of learning differences. The class was a little difficult for me because I took it my first semester freshman year.
1172,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS700,5.0,2.0,"He is an AMAZING professor. Absolutely loved Social Psych. He is clearly a genius and loves what he does, which makes the lectures so enjoyable. I wish he taught more undergrad classes! Whenever he teaches, TAKE HIS CLASS!"
1173,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS700,5.0,3.0,"take social psych regardless of your concentration. malle is amazing, adorable and incredibly helpful outside of class if you make the effort. i also appreciated how he didn't take himself or lecture too seriously. he had fun with it, whereas some other profs here think they are god."
1174,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS0700,5.0,3.0,"He's the nicest, funniest guy. Lecture was extremely enjoyable--I looked forward to it, which I find is rare at Brown. Writing assignments are tricky, but once you get the hang of them, you can do well. Tests are extremely fair: do the reading, understand lecture notes, and you're good. He's approachable, and answers emails quickly. He's cute, too."
1175,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,CLPS0700,4.0,3.0,"Excellent Professor, funny and engaging. Clearly very interested in Social Psychology and made the lectures, even on more boring topics, as interesting as possible. Writing assignments were very structured, but not very hard."
1177,1415216,Bertram,Malle,Brown University,Psychology,PY21,5.0,2.0,"Phenomenal class.  Of the few complaints I have are the structuredness of his writing assignments -- I was able to figure out what he wanted from them, but I definitely disagreed with some of his pedantic grammar rules, which were penalized despite being perfectly valid english."
3506,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ACH101,5.0,2.0,He barely teaches us anything and asks us to give him advice about his romantic life. A overall good teache rmostly because he treats us like his friends or even advisors.
3507,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARC101,5.0,3.0,Best professor I've ever had!
3508,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ECON305,5.0,3.0,pretty cool guy
3509,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARC101,5.0,3.0,"Definitely worth taking one of his classes. He is the most inspirational person you will ever meet, dispute his lack of ability to pronounce Chameleon. Trust me, you wont regret taking his class."
3510,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARC101,5.0,4.0,Professor Mosby is by far my favorite professor. His class was always the highlight of my day and I always looked forward to it! He was also fun to hang out with at the bar and it was amazing to see the building he was designing.
3511,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARC101,5.0,1.0,my favorite professor of all time. he's just the best.
3512,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARC101,5.0,1.0,"WE LOVE PROFESSOR SCHMOSBY!! He took us on a field trip through new York but it was fun, we even met his roommate at the time. he's hilarious and inspiring,and he has amazing costumes!! I love his way of teaching even tho he wanted to tear down beautiful building once. I would definitely take the class again, but too bad he doesn't teach anymore :("
3513,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARCH101,4.0,1.0,"I was actually taking ECON305 when Prof Mosby walked in and began lecturing for ARCH101. When the actual prof showed up he was so insistent that was ARCH101, poor guy the entire class was in hysterics! But after one proper lecture of ECON305 I yeeted myself into ARCH101 with Prof Mosby and haven't looked back since. Whoops gotta go re-design GNB!"
3514,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARC101,5.0,3.0,"pretty funny. took us to a bar for a field trip, so pretty chill too. i wanna be a dj, but prof mosby made me think that if that doesn't work out being an architect seems cool too."
3515,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARCH101,5.0,2.0,best professor ever!!!!
3516,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ARC101,1.0,5.0,His puns are cringy
3517,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ECON305,5.0,2.0,"he made fun of my friend, cool poo, but other then that his halloween costumes were great and his friend on tv was cool"
3518,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ECON305,5.0,1.0,SCHMOSBYYYYYYY
3519,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ACH101,5.0,2.0,"Aside from the amazing lectures, he would probably talk crap all the time. Love the dude!"
3520,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,TRACY4EVER,5.0,2.0,"He know what he's talking about. Also, not only a great prof, but also a great detective."
3521,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ECON305,5.0,2.0,"T-Dog is cool, he has to be THE BEST Econ-305 teacher."
3522,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ECON305,5.0,2.0,He kept poking fun at my name. What's so wrong with Cook Pu?
3523,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ACH101,5.0,1.0,He was so good. I want to be an architect now.
3524,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ECON305,5.0,2.0,"walked into econ305 wearing some legendary red cowboy boots. he was really pulling them off, i think ill get a pair of my own. lectures were fun, sometimes this robin chick would show up in the slides but um... ye t-dawg is cool even if he cant spell professor but well let that slide."
3525,1482580,Ted,Mosby,Columbia University,Architecture,ECON305,5.0,2.0,Prof ted said the most hilarious lobster pun today!
3527,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,CSE101,5.0,3.0,"I have taken classes with this professor before. She is always very thorough and always makes herself available to answer questions before, during and after class. Through her classes, I have gained tremendous knowledge of architectural concepts not typically taught in architecture school and that would take years to learn in the field."
3528,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,CSE1,5.0,4.0,Professor Hanlon has a real knack for breaking down the heavy complicated topics and explaining them in a very clear and straightforward way that makes you just get it. Our course was heavy in topics and items and she still did that for everyone of them. If I study just what she gave me I know I ready to pass my exam!
3529,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,CSE101,5.0,4.0,Professor Hanlon is a very knowledgeable and thorough instructor. Her course material is concise and is exactly what I needed to prepare me for the California Supplemental Exam. She very thoughtfully added an additional day to the course in order to deliver all of the information and work with the candidates. Would definitely recommend.
3530,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,CSE1,4.0,4.0,CSE Prep - Professor Hanlon has excellent knowledge of the material and taking this class is almost critical to passing the CSE. The online version of the class is very effective. Moves quickly and keeps you focused. I took the class in person and the days were long and I lost focus. This class was very effective. I recommend it!
3531,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,CSE101,5.0,4.0,You can tell how much effort she puts in to making sure that you are have accurate and clear information.
3532,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,PPDPDD101,5.0,4.0,Taking this class has made passing the ARE the low hanging fruit and encouraged me to strive for so much more.Â ExcellenceÂ is contagious and you have definitelyÂ passed it on. Thank you for your commitment to education in every way!
3533,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,4.0,4.0,something it is hard to follow. I wish we had pages for notes in the actual syllabus to write as we go.... This is a really fast class so going back and forth is not helpful.
3534,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,4.0,5.0,"Most helpful support for the ARE exams... It's intense, but very helpful and informative. Prof. Hanlon goes to the point."
3535,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,3.0,"I took an online lecture-based study course. Professor Hanlon is very informative, clear and concise. She swiftly moves through the material and stays focused on the topics that matter. I feel much more prepared for my exams thanks to her lectures and direction."
3536,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,3.0,Very knowledgeable on the subject and helpful answering all of our questions. Gave us one extra class to try to finish all of the material. Thank you!
3537,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,4.0,"Fast paced course but she does a great job of helping us get through it. Great teacher and is knowledgable on all topics and is always there to assist, definitely recommend her."
3538,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,4.0,Solid knowledge of code.
3539,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,4.0,4.0,"The pace of the course is perhaps a bit too fast, but overall a great tool to prepare for the exams"
3540,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,4.0,extremely helpful for understanding the ARE and how to navigate the challenging exams.
3541,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,4.0,very good for online learning
3542,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,3.0,Professor Hanlon's commitment to providing future Architects with valuable understanding for the exams has been a tremendous helpful. I am grateful to her dedication and commitment to educate. She was easy to understand and had the right balance of providing background code information while addressing what we actually need to know.
3543,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,4.0,4.0,I took the PPD and PDD 101 course and it is a good class to help you understand what you should be looking out to study for the ARE.
3544,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,PPDPDD101,5.0,3.0,"Accessible and easy to follow along with. Professory answers questions quickly, and gives in depth review of answers"
3545,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,4.0,3.0,Answers student's questions thoroughly.
3546,838456,Umber,Kazmi,Columbia University,Architecture,ARE101,5.0,4.0,The full course was lectured by taking notes and referencing back to the syllable which was very helpful in preparing for the architectural licensing exam. I would recommend taking this course again due to the fact that there are very limited resources out there that are willing to prepare you for the ARE.
3547,1913851,Colin,Mullins,Columbia University,Arts &amp; Humanities,ENGLZ0012001,4.5,2.0,The contents he taught us in class were well balanced in both academic and daily English.
3548,1913851,Colin,Mullins,Columbia University,Arts &amp; Humanities,ALP7,5.0,3.0,"Colin is a teacher who explains things well and gives really helpful feedbacks.

3567,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NU5100,5.0,3.0,"Araujo made my first semester at an Ivy League seem bearable. In a class of students of 200 plus, she managed to be personable and caring. There  were always long lines to speak with her. She's instantly likable and has a different approach to teaching. She engages the class, makes you critically think and laugh out loud while doing it. Love her!!!"

3574,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURSI5110,5.0,3.0,"Great class. Well organized. Strong advocate for women. Understanding when issues come up, she's willing to help you with test taking tips."
3575,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NUR5270,5.0,1.0,This professor has her teaching down to a science. The lectures are organized with just the right amount of info on her slides. Class discussions are fun and open. The entire clss environment was delightful. I met with this professor several mornings BEFORE class and she was nothing but accomadating. She's great at putting things into perspective.
3576,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,5.0,1.0,"This professor is awesome!!!  So full of life and information. Not only does she help you with anything possible, but you can go to her for study tips, career advise or anything else you need help with because she is that dedicated to her students. She always went above and beyond with the students. LOVED HER, HER NOTES, AND HER ORGANIZED CLASS1111"
3577,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NUR5270,4.5,4.0,"In only five short weeks, Professor Araujo taught our class all about OB, Women's Health and Newborns!! She frequently will repeat important information through out the lecture and even did a ""game show quiz-like"" review to make us comfortable with the material. Her lectures are very organized. I also like that she asked us about our clinical exp."
3578,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,5.0,4.0,"Araujo is the best Professor ever!!! We laughed in this class and had a great time...while we were learning. She doesn't try to trick you or act like she is above you. Down to earth, approachable, and clearly an expert in the field. This class didn't last long enough for me. I loved it! I also had Prof Araujo for clinical...I lucked out!!!"
3579,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,1.0,5.0,"araujo was horrible, obnoxious &amp; unreasonable; We will make sure all the prospective students avoid her, she is mean, rude, has no patience, has no recollection how she struggled in school to get where she is; her teaching skills are dreadful!!!"
3580,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed this class and this professor. You actually pay attention in this class because you are not only learning, but being entertained. Lots of tricks to help us remember everything. Araujo is one of my favorite Profs of all time!"
3581,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,5.0,2.0,"Excellent teacher. If you pay attention in her class you will learn. Some students complained because she actually requires tht you READ the textbook, but the text in this class was well worth the money. Very dedicated and interesting to watch during lecture. I was never bored in her class, but rather very interested in what was going to be said ne"
3582,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,5.0,2.0,"As a guy in a mostly all girl class about OB and women's health, I was surprised how Professor Araujo kept me interested in every topic. She is funny and enthusiastic, which even allowed me to enjoy the 6 hour marathon Mondays. We had a few obnoxious students in our class, but they were no match for Professor Araujo's quick wit. Learned a lot!"
3583,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,5.0,4.0,"I was having a tough time and Professor Araujo really helped me out a lot. I met with her several times for one on one ""extra help"" sessions. She is very dedicated and one of the best Professors Columbia has to offer. Strict, but you will know your stuff when you leave her class. I'm sad her class is over"
3584,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NURS5270,5.0,2.0,"FUN CLASS! I almost forgot I was learning. Very dedicated, loves students. Keeps the wise guys in check. Breaks every hour are a plus!"
3585,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NU5270,5.0,3.0,"Thought I would hate this class, but she made me love it. She is very interesting and shares her personal/professional experiences related to the class. Dr.Araujo has total control of the class and she doesn't let the attention seeking question-happy students take over the class. Helps students learn instead of remember. One of the best teachers!"
3586,1084340,Christina,Araujo,Columbia University,Nursing,NU5270,5.0,4.0,One word. Awesome!!!! Too bad that all professors are not as dedicated as she is.
3588,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLSS206,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I've had - If you have the chance, take her class! Manageable work, interesting lectures, great course material guest performers and musicians -what's not to love? She does a great job moderating rewarding daily discussions on literature complemented by stage or film (or even live) performances. Easy to talk to and cool."
3589,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,GREEK332S,5.0,3.0,"Claire is an amazing professor and makes sometimes-difficult material relatable and compelling. Even though the material itself can be challenging, she clearly lays out what's expected in each class, and takes care not to overload students with too much work."
3590,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,GREEK332,5.0,3.0,"By far one of the best professors I've ever had the pleasure of learning under. She is an engaging lecturer, effective teacher, and incredibly kind and understanding, while also just being a super cool person. The workload is not terrible, expectations are straightforward, and you'll learn so much. Absolutely take a class with her!"
3591,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic class taught by a fantastic professor. This is BY FAR the most interesting course I have taken. Her lectures actually inspire you to attend class, which flies by so quickly. There is a fair workload, clear grading criteria, and tests that allow you to really show your understanding. Regardless of major, I cannot recommend highly enough."
3592,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,"Amazing class! Claire is so funny, knowledgeable, and passionate about her subject. Lectures are always fascinating even when you're not allowed to use tech. Not heavy workload, can skim by if you don't do the readings but it's discussion heavy so you should and you have to identify passages in midterms. Assignments really straightforward + short"
3593,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,3.0,"Claire just might be the best lecturer I have ever had. She is engaging, hilarious, and is open to questions. Her background knowledge of her field is extensive, and she is happy to talk about her work after class. Just an absolutely wonderful professor to have and her class has been a highlight to my education."
3594,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,3.0,Absolutely enjoyable class! Prof Catenaccio is extremely well-read and engaging! She incorporates lots of different material so you can really immerse yourself in multiple writing styles and authors. She's extremely considerate and her passion is really contagious.
3595,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,Prof. Catenaccio provided a welcoming environment and class was very interesting. The assignments were short and very fair. The readings were interesting and very manageable. You should stay on top of the readings but if you do fall behind the lectures will keep you informed but to do well I highly suggest completed the readings. Highly Recommended
3596,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,"Professor Catenaccio made class very fun with her witty comments and discussions of Ancient Greek and Roman writings - the workload was light but interesting. Additionally, it was super refreshing to listen to analysis done in a thoughtful way that reflected human emotions (vs. last semester I took this exceedingly boring Ancient Philosophy class)"
3597,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,3.0,"She is really knowledgeable about all things myth, and I am so happy she was the professor for this class that I wasn't so sure that I would like. It ended up being one of my favorite classes so far at Duke! She assigns readings for each class but it's not bad at all. There are 3 writing assignments during the semester."
3598,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,"Claire is an amazing lecturer and her passion for the material makes every class super entertaining. She keeps things fun by introducing contemporary references (in music, art, etc.) to the topics discussed in the class. The reading materials are excellent and you will feel like a real expert on myth after taking this class."
3599,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,1.0,"Claire is absolutely amazing! She made this the most fun and engaging course I have taken at Duke. Low workload, high entertainment. 100% take this class, or any class with her."
3600,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,Prof Catenaccio is an engaging lecturer and works hard to select readings that are relevant and interesting. Her class is accessible for both those who have lots of background in the Classics and those who are just taking the class for fun. Expectations on midterms and papers are pretty clearly defined. Highly recommend taking her class!
3601,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,1.0,"Professor Catenaccio is an awesome teacher! She does a great job at both facilitating discussion and at lecturing for herself about some of the intricacies of the myths that we read. She also did a great job at relating ancient mythology to modern works. She was funny, very nice, and an engaging lecturer who was highly accessible. Take her class!"
3602,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,"Claire is an amazing lecturer, classicist, and person! Her lectures are always engaging and nice break from a busy day. The class is really accessible and low-commitment, but also fun. Would recommend this class and her as a professor!"
3603,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,THEATRST228,5.0,3.0,"Claire was great and really cared about the subject. She also really wanted us to care about the subject and tailored her lessons to class preferences as the semester went on and she got to know us better. She made it really interesting, even for those of us who had never studied classics before."
3604,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,3.0,"Claire is an amazing, thoughtful, and humorous teacher. She clearly knows her material and makes sure that by the end of the class, you are similarly familiar with the subject matter. The readings were enjoyable, didn't take too much time, and she is fair in terms of grading and tests. You won't regret taking a class with her!"
3605,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST208,5.0,2.0,"Fantastic professor. The entire class was extremely well put together, from engaging lectures to efficient homeworks and readings and fair exams. If you're taking a class and have a choice between another professor and Catenaccio, choose her every time."
3606,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,CLST277,5.0,2.0,"Really enjoyed this class! It was very accessible for varying levels of background knowledge on the topic. The papers were clearly explained and the midterms very easy if you read the class materials. Definitely would recommend this class, and Professor Catenaccio was really knowledgeable about the content of the class."
3607,2028091,Claire,Catenaccio,Columbia University,Classics,REL208,5.0,2.0,"Entertaining lectures, engaging, and funny."
3608,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,CSERW391,5.0,4.0,"Took multiple classes with Professor De Genova. He is, without a doubt, one of the best professors Columbia has ever seen.  His scholarly work is exemplary and his commitment to his discipline and the development of his students in unparalleled. Even after leaving, he is still in touch and continues to help through graduate school!"
3609,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,ANTHLAT,4.5,4.0,"I had the pleasure of taking Professor Nicolas De Genova's Latin History &amp; Culture course.  I thought he was a fantastic professor!  I do not think he is anti-american at all!  He was very helpful and approachable, also I guess it helped that he is easy on the eyes."
3610,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,ANTH0000,4.5,4.0,Incredibly knowledgeable about Marx
3611,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,LATS3917,2.0,1.0,pretends to cares but like most of them is insecure and ambitious little man
3612,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,ATH000,3.0,3.0,Shows signgs he endured some sort of Marxist re-education at a low point in his life.
3613,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,ANTH660,5.0,3.0,"very interesting course. he let the seminar do the talking, so he wasn't putting any of his own view on us-- he picked very interesting readings and very approachable when it comes to assignments and office hours"
3615,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,ANTH,1.0,3.0,imposes his warped political views on students.  No desire to be objective or make rational arguments
3617,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,ANTHROPOLOGY,5.0,3.0,"You have the opportunity to study with one of the most intelligent people - go register - you are missing out.

3619,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,LATINOHISTORY,5.0,3.0,"he was a great professor!  People who bash him usually did bad in the class or did not really understand the purpose of his teachings.  His work might be consider controversial, but he is very informative and refreshing."
3620,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,ANTHROPOLOGY,5.0,3.0,"one of the best professors I have encountered in academia.  his scholarly work is outstanding, his teaching commited,his commentaries on papers is comprehensive and reflect his dedication.  the negative comments of others are clearly politically motivated.  He does make his politics clear, but theres no need to worry if you don't agree."
3621,174751,Nicholas,De Genova,Columbia University,Anthropology,LATINOHISTORY,4.5,4.0,Excellent Professor. Excellent Class. Excellent TA's.

3628,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,MACROU6401,5.0,5.0,Professor Bubula is amazing. Very good at explaining tough concepts!
3629,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,EMPAU6017,5.0,4.0,"Exams are like physics exams without the cheat sheets; he really tests your understanding by turning the problems around and having you apply the principles to a problem you haven't even thought about before. Incredibly accessible and a truly kindhearted person at that.  Earn your A here, it's always better that way."
3630,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,U6401,5.0,4.0,Great lectures. Explanations are clear and materials are very useful. You will get rigorous training on macroeconomic basics and also a better understanding of real world issues. Will definitely recommend.
3631,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,EMPAU6017,5.0,1.0,"He is clear, knowledgeable, funny, attentive and takes a genuine interest in students - and best of all, is a gifted teacher. He has a rare ability to make the toughest of concepts easy to understand and breaks it all downs for you step-be-step."
3632,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,MACROU6401,4.5,4.0,Professor Bubula's smaller sections make this course worth it!
3633,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAF4600,4.5,4.0,"Bubula's course is revered and feared by students. An in-depth survey of macro and micro, it delves into technical economic models. Students get frustrated due to the difficulty, but he will spend hours outside of class to help you.  He holds himself and students to the highest standards. My most dedicated SIPA prof and a paragon of teaching."
3634,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,SIPA4201,4.5,4.0,Great professor who really cares if his students learn.
3635,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,U4201,5.0,3.0,"I don't get the angry student below that just kept repeating the same comments.  Professor Bubula is just great.  Very clear, very patient, and very dedicated.  He makes economics accessible."
3636,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAFU640,1.0,4.0,He is not a good professor.  His material is the same every year and teaches class as if he is in a marathon race with no room for questions.  His lectures are poorly written and he relies entirely on his TA's to teach the material which is disconcerning.  I basically taught myself the material and hired a tutor.
3637,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAFU640,1.0,4.0,His material is the same every year with nothing in the current market to add to make the class more stimulating.  His notes are also poorly written and does not know how to explain the concepts well.  Cannot answer any questions outside of his lecture.
3638,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAFU460,1.0,5.0,The material is very interesting and its a pity that he rushes through it and crams in so much without really teaching it.  I feel short changed because we pay so much money at Columbia and instead of getting stellar teaching we get a person reiterating his poorly written lecture notes which he posts online.  His material is the same every year.
3639,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,ECON000,4.0,4.0,"Econ Analysis - Professor Bubula takes a great deal of information and packs it into a short period of time. He's amazingly accessible, so if you get lost, go to his office hours. He'll teach it 20 different ways until you get it, no matter who you are. I loved this class."
3640,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,TRADE4300,5.0,4.0,Absolutely gifted in his craft. Remarkably brilliant and supports the text with personal notes from decades of field work. Makes the course empirically challenging while grounded in relevent policy. He invested extra energy into designing an incredibly well structured course.
3641,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,ECON1,1.0,5.0,Complicating simple ideas.
3642,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAFU600,1.0,5.0,He is not a good professor.
3643,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAF4600,4.5,3.0,"Great instructor who puts a lot of effort in organizing the class, with excellent notes. The problem sets are creatively designed to talk about current issues. Responds well to questions and is extremely helpful."
3644,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAFU460,5.0,5.0,"He is a wonderful Professor that really cares about his students and wants them to succeed, he is also very flexible and is willing to devote extra time if you need it."
3645,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAF4600,4.5,4.0,Great teacher. Supplements the material with problems and examples from whats happening in the world.
3646,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,INAF4600,5.0,5.0,"The course is a lot of work,but he is really invested in students learning the material."
3647,534980,Andrea,Bubula,Columbia University,Economics,ECONSECT,3.0,5.0,He is teaches alright.
3648,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,1.0,PC warned us that we were gonna miss him. He's correct.
3649,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG6001,5.0,1.0,Great semester.
3650,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG6000,5.0,1.0,Gets us to think deeper and write better.
3651,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,1.0,He taught me a lot.
3652,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG6000,5.0,1.0,The most hilarious prof I've ever encountered. Extremely learned even though he plays against it.
3653,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,2.0,One of the good guys.
3654,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,2.0,Good job as PC says.
3655,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG6001,5.0,3.0,Great. Very well-read and informed. Brings a global perspective to his class which most Americans do not.
3656,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,1.0,He's one of the best I had at CU. funny and compassionate.
3657,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,2.0,Scared me at first. He's a hip hop and martial arts expert. It turns out that he's caring and compassionate but obviously not a pushover. As it states on hi syllabus: come strong or don't come at all.
3658,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,1.0,I miss the coolest prof ever.
3659,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG7445,5.0,2.0,He's reminded me of one of the kids in high school who everyone wanted to hang out with. Our classes flew by. I wish he would have lectured more because he seems like he has a lot of useful information about pedagogy and life in general.
3660,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,2.0,I think everyone at CU has a crush on him. More of a gansta than a prof but he's smart even if he doesn't seem it.
3661,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,EHL6001,5.0,1.0,"I thought I was going to hate his class; in the end I loved it. The man is cool, cocky, and a true nonconformist but at the end of the day, he cares about all of us."
3662,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,1.0,It was like being at a comedy club every week. Why isn't this guy on tv?
3663,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ETW5008,5.0,1.0,Definitely teaches out of the box. But he's a welcome change from the stringent political correctness that sometimes stifles us here. And he's a hellava writer.
3664,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,2.0,Great!!!!
3665,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,3.0,Dude's my dude. Doesn't fit in here; doesn't want to. Irreverent humor. Lots of knowledge. Lacks patience sometimes.
3666,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,3.0,"Conti is not your typical professor. He's young, he acts young. I think he misses being a student. The tats, muscles, and New York attitude can be a bit intimidating but once he sees you work hard he'll go all out for you. Just don't be late or defend texting... Its a no-win situation!!"
3667,718899,P,Conti,Columbia University,Writing,ENG1009,5.0,3.0,"great guy. down t earth, really cares."
3669,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALAD101,5.0,4.0,The best course Ive ever taken! Highly recommend!!!

3672,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALAD101,5.0,4.0,Outstanding!
3673,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALAD101,5.0,3.0,"MUST TAKE!!!! This course is one of the best courses that I have ever taken. I was self conscious and nervous about public speaking. this course changed all that. Professor Altshiler is approachable and kind and easy  to understand. She makes the material interesting and, more importantly, manageable. I learned so much in such a short time!"
3674,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALAD101,5.0,3.0,Prof. Altshiler's class is life changing.  I was scared of public speaking and never believed that I could handle a trial.  I went from hesitantly participating in class to handling a full cross examination at trial in federal court.  It was an amazing experience and I feel very confident as a result.  I never imagined myself really doing all this
3675,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALAD101,5.0,3.0,"At first she's difficult but it gets easier and fun. Overall, I highly recommend the class and professor. She makes the material fun and interesting and encourages participation without demeaning anyone."
3676,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALAD101,5.0,2.0,"Liked the class a lot, would take again."
3677,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,2.0,"I recently saw Prof Altshiler on TV.  I thought to myself, that's right, I had her as my professor.  She really is every bit as amazing for every minute of a two hour lecture.  So many professors are dull and boring.  Prof Altshiler is nothing like that.  I wish more professors were like her.  She makes class interesting and exciting and real."
3678,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,3.0,Prof Altshiler makes hard material much easier.  She uses stories from her actual trials to illustrate the rules of evidence and offers examples to make this difficult material come to life.  A lot of professors simply recite whats in the text book.  Prof Altshiler adds life to whats in the text and adds value to the course with her experience.
3679,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,5.0,"At first, Prof Altshiler was a little scary and intimidating. As the class went on, I became more confident in myself and appreciated the Socratic method of teaching. Prof Altshiler is smart and engaging and makes very difficult, voluminous material easier to understand with real life examples. highly recommend!"
3680,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,3.0,Hands down the best course I've ever taken. She's brilliant.
3681,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,3.0,"Professor Altshiler stands out as an objective, funny, reasonable and easy to understand lecturer. She makes dry material simple and even fun by employing real life examples and supplementing the Federal Rules of Evidence with courtroom stories to bring dry material to life. Her course is one not to be missed!!!"
3682,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,2.0,"Beyond a reasonable doubt, the best class ever (chessy, I know). Seriously, loved this course."
3683,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,4.5,3.0,The dry topic evidence rules with exceptions to exceptions to exceptions is made vividly clear with examples upon examples. She does not stand there and boringly recite the textbook; she lectures with real life situations and personal trial experiences. Professor Altshiler is a rare bread with extensive experience to support what she lectures.
3684,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,3.0,"You can tell she cares. She is super passionate about trials and her excitement and passion make you want to participate and get excited about the topic too. Unlike some dry professors, she engages everyone and encourages involvement. I've never felt so enthusiastic about a course as I did in this class. Why isn't she offering more courses? "
3685,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,3.0,"I don't think that I've ever laughed as hard or learned as much in any other class, ever!  This is the one class where I want to put my cell down, turn off Facebook notifications and just listen and participate.  The Prof takes an otherwise tedious and complicated topic and turns it into something real.  Her stories are incredible.  I want more!!!"
3686,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,3.0,"You go from knowing nothing to presenting a trial in court. You feel like a hero; the professor nourishes your strengths, erases your weaknesses, makes you believe that you are an intelligent, capable adult and never talks down to you (like some professors tend to). She's also hilarious. I cant say enough great things. This changed my life. Serious"
3687,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,3.0,Professor Altshiler was and still is my favorite professor EVER. This class is worth taking even if you have no interest in trial law.
3688,1912223,Florina,Altshiler,Columbia University,Law,TRIALADVOCACY,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor! One of the most approachable, insightful and  outstanding professors I have ever had!"
3690,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,2.0,"David Siegel is of one the best professors I had at SIPA. He is very energetic and engaging. He is as eager to share his decades of experience as he is to listen to students' inputs. I also really liked his teaching style and grading system - no midterm or final exams, just weekly one-pagers about a case or a book, and a final group project."
3691,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Siegel IS AMAZING. I adore the man and most importantly he is a fabulous teacher, so much energy, he gives so much to his students, listens to us and is fabulous all around. I loved his class and recommend it to everyone. Ps- Prof. is very hot."
3692,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,4.0,He is one of the most energetic professors at SIPA!
3693,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,4.0,4.0,"To encourage people to speak in class is good, but maybe add some in class group discussion to share opinions will be good as well."
3694,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,2.0,"David clearly has passion for his work and it extends to the classroom. He is engaging and enthusiastic and high energy, which makes class a lot of fun to attend. He asks great questions about the books and case studies. I would definitely take his class again and highly recommend this one!"
3695,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,3.0,4.0,A good overview of entrepreneurial management cases and books. Can be more systematic.
3696,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,2.0,"That class was a rare combination of being not especially challenging, but at the same time very engaging and I walked away from every class feeling that I had learned something of quality -- about working with people in the real world -- that I would not hear from other professors. Definitely treated this class like ""life therapy."""
3697,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,4.0,"Professors that work in practice are always much more interesting than professors that teach to theory. Professor Siegle has a huge amount of first-hand practical knowledge and experience which he shares with us. Relatedly, he is upfront and honest about how things are in 'the real world,' which is extremely refreshing."
3698,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPA6014,5.0,4.0,"Very active and interactive teaching style. Classes are entertaining and full of real-life advice, stories and experience."
3699,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,3.0,"I really like the concept of one-pager, it truly allows me to reflect every week on the reading and actually learn something. The discussions in class were all valuable. I also love how he is open to suggestion about any change which will help improve the course."
3700,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,4.0,"Very charismatic in the classroom, makes it hard for students to not stay engaged!"
3701,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,4.0,"There are no tests but every week you will HAVE to read &amp; write a one pager. There is no way to get around doing the work for the class. Great lecture, really adds value to your every day life too. All learnings are relevant to your daily life and the professor is really engaged in class. You have to be wide awake in class because he definitely is."
3702,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,3.0,Great class!
3703,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,SIPAU6014,5.0,4.0,"Given that he's a business person teaching at a policy/international affairs school, it might seem an odd fit, but he care about his students and put their interests first, always tying class material back to policy/real world implications. His passion/energy is infectious and he's an excellent discussion facilitator!  TL,DR: David is awesome."
3704,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,3.0,The class is discussion based and participation counts. The discussions are interesting and thought-provoking. I highly encourage you to take any course with David if you want to be pushed to think outside of the box in terms of business.
3705,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,3.0,"Professor Siegel is great! His lectures are brief and interesting, most of the class is dedicated to class discussions where he pushes students to really critically engage with the readings and with each other. He shares wonderful insights from his own (very rich) work experience. I highly recommend the class!"
3706,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,3.0,"The reason I really liked David as a professor was because he really cared about all of the students, he knew all of our names by the third class and was dedicated to having us get as much as we could out of the course, which can't be said for all professors at SIPA."
3707,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,4.0,4.0,Professor Siegel 's energy and passion for good business management will rub off on you! Great material and teaching style with lots of participation and discussion opportunities.
3708,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,4.0,Prof. Siegel is very energetic and inspiring.
3709,2192193,David,Siegel,Columbia University,International Studies,U6014,5.0,3.0,"Professor doesn't just lecture, he engages the whole class. Fun class to be in and learnings are always relevant and practical. However, having no choice over group members and not being privy to the way groups are formed results in some difficulty working in a group with low synergy and lack of complementary skills or interests."
3711,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7103,3.0,3.0,"The grading criteria for assignments was unclear at times but our TA would always clarify. He had a habit of inviting people to ask questions and then saying that those questions should be asked privately/after class, but that could be because it was an online course. Overall, it was an okay class."
3712,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6801,5.0,4.0,"Professor Robertson is the real deal. He's an amazing professor with a wealth of knowledge. His classes definitely have a good amount of work, but you will learn a lot. I appreciate the space he creates for other opinions, and I also appreciate the push back he gives because I think it creates better social workers. Work hard you'll do well."
3713,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,T7103,5.0,4.0,"A great professor. A lot of people might think him to be arrogant. That's probably because he likes challenge students in terms of their existing beliefs and thoughts. However, I think he is open-minded and respect people with different thoughts and backgrounds. I especially appreciate that. The requirements for paper is also clear and specific."
3714,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6801,4.0,3.0,"The Bad: a bit arrogant (but nowhere near the terrible Marian Riedel). The Good: I actually learned a lot in this class, which is more than I can say for many of the classes at this school. While he can be aloof, I think John Robertson is also a pretty good teacher and I appreciated his class making me work and challenging my beliefs."
3715,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,T6801,3.0,3.0,"Lectures are good. You have to do weekly assignments, but they're not a big deal. He can come across as a little arrogant, but I'm always glad to hear from a professor who will share their (well-supported) opinion."
3716,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,POLICY,5.0,3.0,"Very Clear. Likes to challenge students to think from a different perspective, which I found really helpful and inspirational. Helpful. Has a sense of humor."
3717,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,T6801,2.0,5.0,Definitely someone who needs to learn people skills first.  Does not respect students or their input.
3718,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,WELFAREPOLICY,4.5,2.0,"Professor Robertson is an extremely intelligent, knowledgeable and effective teacher. He may not seem approachable in class, but if you get to know him, he's a very empathic and thoughtful person. I learned a lot from him about welfare policy and about myself."
3719,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,T6801,1.0,4.0,"Terrible professor. Avoid him if you can. He puts no effort into class, and so the two hours we spend there each week are useless. VERY confusing on assignments, and on grading as well. Worst of all, he is extremely pretentious, and very disrespectful to his students. I love the topic, and am really disappointed about this class."
3720,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6801,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Robertson is incredibly intelligent and I loved his lectures because I felt like I was really learning a lot. I can see what others are saying about the non-personability, but that didn't really bother me. I would recommend him because I did learn a lot however it does seem to take a lot to impress him."
3721,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,POLIC1,4.5,2.0,He actually is approachable  You just have to approach him.  He is a very kind.  Once you approach him he'll be very helpful.
3722,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVO1,1.5,3.0,"Knowledgeable alright, but I've had knowledgeable profs who are actually also personable. This prof is probably the one I dislike the most. He can't engage the class, people hardly participate, because he hasn't managed to create a good class atmosphere. He does not know how to reflect, respond, and relate to students' feedback. Preachy in lecture."
3723,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT008,1.0,3.0,Very knowledgeable but very unapproachable and unclear about expectations for assignments.
3724,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6801,2.0,3.0,"I found Robertson to be very knowledgable but not at all personable. Whenever I had a question about an assignment, he made me feel like an idiot and refused to provide clarification. While I learned a lot in his class, I found him to be completely unapproachable. If policy isn't your cup of tea, I wouldn't suggest taking his class."
3725,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,POL6801,2.5,4.0,"Prof assigns a LOT of reading and expects you to remember them in minute detail for his ridiculous pop quizzes (also the only policy prof who additionally quizzes you on the ny times). He is okay as a person, just wish he would be cognizant of everything else most SW students deal with and didn't set unrealistic expectations for reading."
3726,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,T7103001,4.5,3.0,one of the best professors in policy related classes
3729,523923,John,Robertson,Columbia University,Social Work,T6801,5.0,3.0,"Class is interesting, and he adds real life through use of stories from the NYT."
3730,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,5026,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Allsup is the best professor you will ever have. He is one of the most inspiring and intelligent people on the planet!! I feel so lucky to have taken his classes this year and I know that they have made me a better musician, collaborator, educator and overall a happier individual.  I would retake this class over and over if I could!!"
3731,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,CPSCPS,4.5,3.0,"Took him for Creativity and Problem solving in music ed. People who criticize are looking for a fountainhead of information perhaps, and Randall is more about letting us make our own discoveries through the class activities and readings. He is VERY humble. He reinforced my confidence in thinking outside the box and gave me paths to success!"
3732,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,AHM5025,4.5,2.0,"Be fair people. We are talking about a highly committed educator here. None of us are perfect, yet these professors work their hardest to ensure our education. It's up to you what kind of education you receive. Blaming the professor will make you a lousy teacher. Great work Randall. Signed, a Non-favorite"
3733,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,AHM5025,5.0,2.0,"Coming from someone who is currently teaching in the public schools, I have found Dr. Allsup's courses to be helpful and inspiring. It is evident that he puts an enormous amount of thought and care into his teaching, making each class enlightening and productive."
3734,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,AHM5025,5.0,2.0,"He surely is one of the most intelligent people I have ever known.  He is always very supportive.  He cares, respects and listens to the students.  He has helped me think critically about my role as a music teacher.  It has always been a pleasure to be in his class.  I would definitely recommend his class!"
3735,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,CREAT101,5.0,3.0,"Have to strongly disagree with the other reviews of Allsup. One of the best teachers I've had. Encouraged me to think about music in ways I never had, and to think critically about my real life teaching. Exceptionally thoughtful and engaged, and pushed me to imagine more of myself. Can't recommend him highly enough."
3736,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,PHIL599,1.5,3.0,"A very intelligent person. Needs to learn a little humility. His ideas on politics and education are definitely on the far left. As a professor, I hope he will learn to see the argument on all sides and NOT take sides. Objectivity is not one of his strengths."
3737,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,MUSICAABB,2.5,2.0,"This guy is full of himself. He speaks but says little that is useful, and he's no musician. He is a great example of the common assumption that music ed prof are unmusical and incomprehensible. TC should have much higher standards for their profs. They hired him because he graduated from here. Sorry, not good enough!"
3738,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,GRADOOOO,2.0,4.0,"Allsup is overrated. He doesn't know much about real music making, or the real world of teaching today. He talks in circles. He sounds intellectual, but if you listen carefully, he isn't saying anything of consequence. Smooth, but full of postmodern nonsense. He's not nearly good enough to be at TC."
3739,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,ST1,5.0,3.0,A wonderful mentor.  He changed my perception on teaching.    He was always available for help even after I graduated from TC.
3740,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,CREAT101,5.0,3.0,"This creative professor opened my mind, and truly helped my own teaching. Stellar."
3741,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,PHILO101,3.0,3.0,"Inspiring professor, but sometimes gets overwhelmed with his work and consequently makes mistakes"
3742,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,MUS101,3.0,4.0,nice!
3743,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,AHM001,4.5,4.0,Great teacher.
3744,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,CREATIVITYI,5.0,3.0,Absolutely brilliant.
3745,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,CREATIVITY,1.5,3.0,seems to show favoritism
3746,733550,Randall,Allsup,Columbia University,Music,PHIL,1.0,3.0,Disinterested in his students.
3749,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,LEGALT710,5.0,4.0,"Hands down the best Ivy League Professor I have ever had!  He is brilliant and has multiple graduate degrees and a law degree.  He is always available for his students, and is also extremely good looking!  He inspired me to go to law school and change the world!   I would have taken him for every class if I could.  He should never stop teaching."
3750,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7901,5.0,3.0,"Professor Redding is very passionate about the balance of law and social work regarding various legal issues.  The lectures are informative and presented well so that you are not confused by law terms. Course consists of several written assignments and one oral presentation, but everything is manageable."
3751,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT7901,5.0,2.0,"Literally one of the most passionate and knowledgeable professors I have ever had. Spends massive amounts of time sharing his experience with ample class participation. Legal Foundations was all papers, but easy assignments. If you want an easy professor with a ton of knowledge, this is your guy."
3752,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT7103,5.0,2.0,"Best Professor I have taken at Columbia, extremely helpful and really cares about his students!  His classes were engaging and interesting, I don't need my usual triple shot of espresso for this class.  He also lined-up an outstanding summer internship in the NYC courts for me. Take this Prof., he will inspire you to change the world! "
3753,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,T7103,5.0,3.0,"Professor Marcus Redding is a brilliant professor, passionate about advocacy, professional, and able to see the big picture about all issues however intense. Accessible and approachable. I only have good things to say, and truly learned lessons on how to be the  social change agent we aim to be. He made my project come alive for me. Take his class!"
3754,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT7901,5.0,2.0,"Professor Redding has been my favorite professor at Columbia so far. He is bright, eloquent, available and invested in teaching. He presents the material with enthusiasm, clarity and relevance to the work we do, bringing in real-world experience as examples."
3755,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT7901,4.5,3.0,"Professor Redding is everything everyone describes. He's so passionate and invested in getting his students to think about social issues from a legal perspective. Overall a great course, and by far my favorite of the semester. I'm only bummed I'm not going to be able to take him for advocacy. He's the best."
3756,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT710301,5.0,2.0,"The professor was extremely experienced, interesting and passionate about advocacy. The advocacy skills you learn you can actually use in your professional practice. Overall, I learned more in this class than any other Columbia course I have taken.  TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!"
3757,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVOC002,5.0,3.0,Awesome Professor!!!
3758,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVOC7103,5.0,2.0,Outstanding class and teacher!
3759,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVOC7103,5.0,2.0,"FIVE STAR IVY LEAGUE PROFESSOR! HE IS BRILLIANT, BUT VERY PERSONABLE."
3760,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVOC7103,5.0,2.0,Finally I found a Professor who has real world experience coupled with academic expertise. His teaching method is outstanding and after you take his class you feel like you can change the world!
3761,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,HBSE660B,5.0,2.0,this professor really cares about his students and is an amazing lecturer - highly recommend taken him - your learn a lot!
3762,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,LEGALT710,5.0,2.0,OUTSTANDING LAW/SW PROF. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! HE ALSO HELPED ME FIND A JOB AFTER GRADUATION THIS SPRING SEMESTER IN THE COURT SYSTEM.
3763,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCB,5.0,2.0,Outstanding Professor! Highly recommend taking him : )
3764,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7103,5.0,2.0,"Omg he is the best professor ever and I've never met a professor that cares so much about he students, he will make a difference in your life and career!"
3765,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVOC7103,5.0,2.0,"The best professor at Columbia, he was engaging and passionate about the subject matter. I learned how to be an advocate in his class."
3766,1559862,Markus,Redding,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7901,4.5,1.0,"A great and stimulating lecturer who is extremely interested in the intersections of social work and law. He attempts to cater to his students needs, so be sure to speak to him if you have any disagreements/suggestions for the curriculum. Be sure to talk in class."
3767,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCW3225,5.0,3.0,"Professor Buhle is a wonderful professor. I took his class as a senior in Columbia, after having taken a multitude of science and psychology courses, and I can confidently say that he is one of the best professors I've had. He challenges his students, but is always there to explain and help. Jason is a great and I recommend any class he teaches."
3768,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCS3225,4.5,4.0,Jason is a great professor; readings and discussion was great and stimulating. But he is not easy; he assigns a decent amount of work and expects a lot from his students. I really enjoyed this class.
3769,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,W3225,5.0,4.0,"Highly, highly recommended."
3770,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYC3225,5.0,3.0,"Jason is the most helpful, most approachable professor I've encountered in Columbia's sometimes somewhat frosty Psych Dept.  His courses are meticulously constructed and pretty much require and guarantee student participation at a high level--so also don't take Jason if you're hoping to miss classes fairly regularly or to get an easy A."
3771,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,SQ3225,5.0,3.0,"A fascinating scientific inquiry into the wandering mind that seizes undivided attentions. More than knowledge is gained, as Professor Buhle passionately invests in cultivating student’s skills in cogent analysis and reasoning of diverse research studies. Rising intellectual tides support each student’s float to scholar status by course end. Great!"
3772,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYC3225,5.0,4.0,"Professor Buhle is knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and helpful.  He was great at encouraging and sustaining discussion in a summer class that met at 9am, which is pretty impressive."
3773,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,3.0,"Jason is an earnest, honest, intense, intelligent, and creative teacher.  He seems to take a genuine interest in seeing all of his students learn and succeed.  I would jump to take another class with him if that were feasible."
3774,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,S3225,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic! He gives very constructive criticism relating to assignments and class discussion. Extremely eloquent and approachable,knows how to create a developing syllabus. genuinely cares about your interest and success. So glad I got the opportunity to have him. Great professor, and I'd say mentor as well."
3775,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYC1010,4.5,4.0,"Definitely recommend this professor. The course covers a lot of material, but he presents it well, at times he's funny, &amp; so it's not too heavy. Actually cares about his students and does more than any other professor I've had to make sure students understand the concepts and do well."
3776,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYC1010,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor! Very organized, an eloquent lecturer, and utilizes many teaching methods to make the information as accessible as possible. His course definitely requires a lot of work, but it's all interesting, and he gives many interesting opportunities for extra credit. Also, he is always available for help if a student has a question."
3777,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,MBB1010,5.0,4.0,"Really good instructor. Very well organized and prepared - which was great with the large volume of information in this course. This instructor really wants students to learn and does everything he can to make that happen. Great with study tips, knowledge and presentation. Liked the way he introduced critical thinking of subject beyond the text."
3778,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYC1,4.5,3.0,"Very effective professor and really cares about his students.  His tests cover a lot of material, but he tries as much as he can to help out the students along the way with refresher quizzes along with numerous study guides and office hours."
3779,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCH1010,5.0,3.0,"Extremely nice guy, and a solid professor. He really seems to care about the students. The material is a little difficult sometimes, but that is primarily due to the sheer volume of material, and not due to any lack of clarity from the professor. His lectures are very clear, and he always tries to incorporate creative teaching methods."
3780,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCH1,5.0,3.0,Concisely presents and summarizes key points in extensive text book. Answers questions willingly and well. Willing to schedule additional office hours. Seems to care that students do well and understand material. In class non-graded pop quizzes helpful.
3781,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCH1010,4.0,4.0,Efficiently attempts to move through a large amount of material.
3782,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCH1010,5.0,2.0,Of all the teaching qualities that Professor Buhle possesses his eagerness for students to learn the material he presents is seen in the multiple methods of learning and tutoring that he employees in lectures. He is extremely receptive to student feedback making the class feel they are part of the delicate balance that is learning and empowerment.
3783,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCH1010,4.5,4.0,"Good, efficient professor. Passionate about teaching the material."
3784,1710157,Jason,Buhle,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCH1010,4.5,4.0,"Professor Jason Buhle is very knowledgeable in his field of work.  He is incredibly helpful and willing to support student learning,  Which is necessary if you are not a Neuroscience major. There is a retinue of TA's for the class so there is plenty of support with facilitated study sessions and quick response to emailed questions."
3786,17674,Xavier,Sala-i-Martin,Columbia University,Economics,MACRO11,2.0,1.0,Professor Sala acts more like an entertainer than a teacher. Engaging lectures but little learning. He also quite political and promotes a pretty extreme view on neoliberalism.

3788,17674,Xavier,Sala-i-Martin,Columbia University,Economics,ECON3213,5.0,2.0,"Incredibly interesting AND entertaining. Most useful material I've learned in school. Midterm comically easy, final difficult but with heavy curve. Absolute must take! "

3830,170601,Maura,Spiegel,Columbia University,English,ENGLISH,1.5,3.0,Superficial; lacks her own ideas
3831,170601,Maura,Spiegel,Columbia University,English,VICTORNLIT,5.0,2.0,"very nice prof, not the most dynamic class... maybe it was just my year. Almost all girls.  She was very helpful, though.  I saw her on the history channel once, talking about the history of cleavage or something.  Interesting."
3832,170601,Maura,Spiegel,Columbia University,English,ENG,5.0,3.0,"She is phenomenal. Respects student opinions, presents brilliant interpretations of texts, and is laid back and approachable. Wonderful person and teacher."
3834,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIOL2005,2.0,5.0,"The material is fascinating and in depth but your grade depends on how well you can solve puzzles, not how well you understand the material. The desire to confund/obfuscate on exams was demoralizing &amp; conjured up a special kind of dread. Professor was condescending and relished her notoriety. This class is unfortunately not designed to help you."
3835,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIOL2005,3.0,3.0,Take her class if you are a bio major. It's def worth it. Just be ready to put effort
3836,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIOL2005,5.0,4.0,"If you are a Biology or Neuro major at Columbia you have to take her class. It's a difficult class with difficult material but you are overwhelmed with resources, assistance, and help along the way. Her lectures are better than any professor I've ever had for their flow, engagement, and clarity. Exams are the only points in the class."
3837,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,UN2006,1.0,5.0,"""Well maybe you don't have what it takes to be a doctor"" she says while claiming to have a modern pedagogical approach to Biology. If you are struggling in this class, she doesn't care. Don't encourage this instructor by accepting whatever she throws at you, fight the system to change it. needs to be taken off her self-created thrown and exposed!"
3838,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIOLC2006,2.5,5.0,"You will realize that even the people who were fond of Dr. M, gave the class an easiness rating of 1. Challenging is one thing, but this class is hard for all the wrong reasons. Say what you want, but this class was very inefficient, and the ridiculous tests made ""beating"" the tests more important than learning biology."
3839,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIOLC2005,2.0,5.0,Useful info in lectures. Tests are basically word games and brain teasers testing whether you can avoid her traps within the time limit. Most of the convoluted problems do not apply to the real world and make no sense or are cryptically worded. This is nothing like an ordinary Intro Bio class and is a definite set-up for failure.
3840,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIO101,3.0,5.0,"She is the hardest professor I have ever had in my entire education. Her tests are very convoluted and extremely difficult. It is not enough to know the concepts and terminology. You MUST know how to apply the concepts to real world examples you have never heard of, that often do not make sense. She sets you up to fail."
3841,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,INTROBIO,3.5,3.0,Took the basic bio class way back when.  She was a crummy advisor but an excellent in-class professor.  Concepts were explained clearly and the lectures were all well organized.
3842,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIO121,5.0,5.0,"Dr. M is a great teacher, but you will have to work hard to get a good grade."

3844,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,CHEM2414,5.0,4.0,I downloaded her podcasts and believe she is one of the best professors in term of clearing up my understanding on cell biology and hormones.  Definately recommended for any health care professional to review their knowledge and understanding
3845,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIO101,4.5,5.0,"Class is hard in terms of getting a good grade. However, the Prof. tries harder to teach the material.  If you do not miss class and take good notes, the class can be rewarding and even fun. One caviat, tough grader~!"
3847,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,BIOLOGYC20056,4.0,4.0,Great lecturer. Hard class but you will definitely learn the material. You'll be thanking her when you take the MCAT.
3848,813119,Deborah,Mowshowitz,Columbia University,Biology,C2005F2401,2.5,5.0,soooo hard!! exams are more like logic puzzles than biology tests...must be 100% fluent with the material to do welll on the exams....takes 3-4 weeks minimum to study for 1 exam. soo hard!

3852,798155,Robin,Reisig,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,3.0,3.0,"The worst class I've ever taken.  Gratuitous criticism, incoherent edits, and massive class disorganization.  She finds a way to say the meanest things in the nicest sounding voice.  Borderline abusive in her stinging personal comments.    Lacks any sense of tact and will wade into your personal life.  Got to love those late Saturday night  calls!"
3853,798155,Robin,Reisig,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,1.0,3.0,I feel like I wasted my time and money taking her class.  get out while you still can!

She can be hurtful, but I have yet to find another j-school professor who cared more about my future. She creates a tight group in her class, which usually are among the most ambitious, bright and most published students."
3857,798155,Robin,Reisig,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,1.0,4.0,"All she did was insult me--she never helped me with my work.  If I wrote something good, she would put me down, mock me and say somebody else must have written it for me."
3858,798155,Robin,Reisig,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,1.0,5.0,"A complete ****.  Taking her class was my worst experience at Columbia.  Reisig is condescending, annoying, selfish, and makes spending time with her in class an experience you come to dread.  Do anything you can to avoid RW1 with her, and find a new job, Robin."
3859,798155,Robin,Reisig,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,3.0,4.0,"Robin is really very sweet and sincerely wants to make you the best writer possible. But she also can be cloying, unintentionally hurtful and just plain annoying. I learned a lot. I also rolled my eyes a lot. If you're impatient and like a lot of order, don't take this class. But if you can handle the overabundance of e-mails, go on and take it."

I really knew very little about the dynamics of the Muslim world going in and came out with not only a strong understanding of contemporary Islamic civiliization, but also a stronger appreciation of its relationship with Western Civ."
3871,398827,Joseph,Massad,Columbia University,Languages,MEPOLITICS,4.5,3.0,Excellent professor by all standards. He has his opinions and isnt afaid to share them- and DOES allow others express different opinions. I think he is an excellent- esp. when he argues with facts and data rather than sheer emotional passions
3872,398827,Joseph,Massad,Columbia University,Languages,MEPOLITICS,5.0,2.0,Interesting narrative. Open to differing opinions. Engaging.

He is brilliant, articulate, masterful at presentation of complex material, demystifies all the math and technical terminology, gives easy-to-remember illustrations and study tips. He is kind, patient, always accessible, and has a genuine interest in his students. A wonderful person."
3878,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT6505,5.0,4.0,"Professor Schinke got me  through a very difficult course.  He made it easy to understand,  with a  very good staff.  Professor Schinke made the difference!"
3879,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,T6009,4.0,2.0,"Professor Schinke is a great Statistics teacher. The textbook he uses is great for class, and makes learning statistics easy and fun (PS - Math is not my forte). I was a little nervous for the class to be taken online, but overall it wasn't bad. Complete the weekly readings and quizzes and it's an easy pass."
3880,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,SW6501,5.0,3.0,"Schinke is a brilliant professor who makes research methods interesting and applicable to real life.  If you do the readings and participate in class, you will do well.  He is one of the best at CUSSW."
3881,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6501,1.5,5.0,"The rules of Prof. Schinke's class are what makes it so difficult to get a decent grade. You only get credit for participating on certain days and if the TA doesn't notice you, you get points off. It's curved to your disadvantage. Schinke's a good teacher, but it's a bad class."
3882,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6501,4.5,5.0,This class is hard but I learned a lot.  If you keep up with the readings and participate actively in class you should be alright.  The exams can be a bit tricky but I seem to have learned so much more than students who took this class from other professors.
3883,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,RESEA1,4.5,3.0,"Great professor-- made a boring topic fun and even funny. I'm not sure I agree with those who said the class was hard-- as long as you do the reading and make some notecards for the tests, it seems pretty simple to me."
3884,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,RESEA1,4.0,4.0,Professor Schinke is great! He made a very dry and boring class pretty easy to follow along and interesting. Be prepared for those pop quizzes and your requisite turns to speak in class. If you stay on top of your readings and in class notes you will be fine.
3885,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,RESEA6501,4.5,4.0,Schinke knows his stuff! he is informative and makes the boring information understandable. He utilizes examples that are relateable. The first hour is lecture style followed by 30 mins of group work. GOOD class to learn.
3886,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,RESEARCH,3.0,5.0,The hardest class I've ever taken.
3887,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,RESEARCHMTHDS,3.5,5.0,"If you love taking tests and quizzes ONLY--without opportunity for any papers--take this class. If you do better with papers and presentations, take someone elses class.  Hands down, Schinke is the best dressed professor at Columbia.  Seriously--he looks like a million bucks at all times. Take his class just for the view!  Very easy on the eyes."
3888,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,RESEARCHMETHOD,4.0,5.0,"Hard class, but he is totally available to give extra help.  He is the most avaible prof at school. His class is not for the faint of heart!!!  If you've never taken a research class before--or if you have trouble with math, statistics, other technical areas--he is not the teacher for you.  If you are advanced, take the course."
3889,831227,Steven Paul,Schinke,Columbia University,Social Work,RESEARCHMETHOD,1.0,2.0,"Schinke's class manner is fun at first, until you begin to encounter his frustratingly arbitrary testing style. He wrote cutesy questions that were ambiguous and then dug in his heels despite the protests of the entire class. Very frustrating!"

He knows he is more brilliant than you are, but he lacks proper social awareness that would lead him to interact normally with you as a human being. He's precisely what you would imagine as a law professor -- a high opinion of himself with grossly lacking interpersonal skills."

The one good point he makes is that BigLaw is awful.  You can get that from reading Will Meyerhofer (the People's Therapist),  and you don't need Moglen repeating it ad nauseum at you.  But hey, the class is easy."

3930,552246,Ernest,April,Columbia University,Science,ANATANAT,3.5,4.0,Dr. April is actually a pretty cool professor. As a first year medical student I had heard horror stories but found that most of them were exaggerated. Overall I would enjoy having him again.
3931,552246,Ernest,April,Columbia University,Science,ANAT101,1.0,4.0,OMG. This guy is still teaching?! I took his class back in 1990-1 and hated it. The man was generally disliked by P&amp;S students back then. He was consistently hitting on the more atractive women in the class. Very ego driven. A legend in his own mind.
3932,552246,Ernest,April,Columbia University,Science,ANMY1,1.0,5.0,"Dr. April certainly thinks he is one of the best teachers at the medical school, but he is actually one of the worst.  His approach to teaching is best described as Machievellian.  Whatever you do, don't go to his office hours."

He enjoys teaching anatomy and tries to make the course interesting and clinically relevant.  People who have trouble with anatomy like to take their frustration out by bashing him."
3939,552246,Ernest,April,Columbia University,Science,CLINICALANATOM,1.0,4.0,THE WORST TEACHER IN THE WORLD.  AND MEAN-SPIRITED GUY TOO.  BUT HIS COURSE IS REQUIRED.
3940,552246,Ernest,April,Columbia University,Science,ANATOMY,1.0,3.0,"Professor April is an exceedingly insecure, vulgar individual who consistently treats students in an inappropriate manner.  He sometimes fabricates anecdotes during his lectures, which also contain highly inappropriate and bigotted jokes.  Anatomy is fascinating, in spite of his teaching."
3941,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,JOUR6002,2.5,5.0,"The first thing I noticed about Prof. Friedman is that he is angry. The anger comes out sideways, and energy better spent helping students organize their book proposals is instead used to demean and belittle them.  His makes excellent suggestions on narrative journalism and my writing improved, but his anger gets in the way."
3942,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,BOOKSEMI,5.0,5.0,"Freedman is phenomenal.  During my dual-degree at Columbia, I?ve never had a professor as dedicated to improving his students? writing and diligent about editing their work as Freedman.  He has a genuine reverence for journalism and inculcates his students with exemplary habits. I only regret that I was too timid to go to his office hours more."
3943,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,ETHIC001,4.0,3.0,"I found this class thought-provoking and well-thought out.  Prof. Freedman is a little rough around the edges in terms of personal style, but if you look beyond that, he cares passionately about journalism, his students and the value of integrity.  He never came to lecture less than 110 percent prepared and what he offered was from the heart."
3944,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,BOOK1,5.0,5.0,"I was in Freedman's book class. It's one of the best at J-school. It required super-human work and, for me, no spring break. He could be blunt. But it's rediculous to expect him to shower you with complements. His comments were comprehensive and helpful, and he did commend strivers. After graduation he also put me in touch with a book agent."
3945,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,BOOK1,1.0,1.0,"I had Freedmen for his book class in 05. His ""sophistic dialectic"" helped me get an agent the day after graduation, and now i'm on a book contract. Plus, you used ""byzantine"" wrong, you nitwit. You meant draconian, and he is that. Unless you meant that his no potty rule was highly complicated or intricate; seems pretty simple to me."
3947,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,CRITICAL,4.5,3.0,"Organized, clear, structured, focused.  Freedman was more committed to clarity than any other professor in my experience at Columbia.  The undue criticism is directed toward his strict lectures and impersonal presentation style.  He's here to teach, not to be your friend.  Get over it, and do the readings.  You'll have less time to complain."

3950,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,CRIT1,1.5,1.0,"His arrogance masks deep insecurity. Maybe he could e-mail his ""speeches"" to the students instead of making everyone suffer through the most wasted class in jschool (collective punishment?). His ethical Fridays were a pompous exercise in self-adulation. He seldom talks about the readings and a typical speech always begins, ""In (fill in year here)."""
3951,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,3.0,5.0,He prides himself on being a dictator and seems to get too much pleasure out of being tough.  i could have used a gentler style.
3952,812121,Samuel,Freedman,Columbia University,Journalism,BOOKWRITING,4.5,5.0,Don't take Freedman if you want warm and fuzzy.  He's distant and tough.  But he'll inspire you to good work and read every word you write.  His comments are extensive and detailed.

I rated her poorly because every single class you will be bombarded with talk of her political opinions. Every class is about patriarchy, sexism, racism, etc., instead of focusing on the literature."
3956,1696418,Mary-Grace,Albanese,Columbia University,Not Specified,ENG270,4.0,2.0,She's great. Light course load. Student presentations take up most of the class period. This course helped me become better at close reading and analyzing texts.
3957,1696418,Mary-Grace,Albanese,Columbia University,Not Specified,ENG270,5.0,3.0,"Prof Albanese is one of the best I've had at Bing. She really pushes students to be better thinkers and totally changed the way I analyze texts and write. I don't know what the other reviewer means about her being pretentions, she is pretty much the opposite of that. Only time I remember her cutting students off, they were saying offensive stuff."
3958,1696418,Mary-Grace,Albanese,Columbia University,Not Specified,ENG270,2.0,4.0,Gives pretentious feedback that is difficult to decipher and find the meaning of. Cuts students off while their talking in discussion if she doesn't agree or if the student is wrong and doesn't explain. Doesn't give clear expectations for papers and grading and is always on her phone and not paying attention during presentations.
3959,1696418,Mary-Grace,Albanese,Columbia University,Not Specified,450G,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor. She doesn't baby you and takes student's interests seriously (she even asks our input for the syllabus/classroom activities). Don't take her if you need essay prompts or hand holding but an awesome class if you are considering graduate school or just want some flexibility. Young, laid-back, cool clothes."

3961,1696418,Mary-Grace,Albanese,Columbia University,Not Specified,ENG270,5.0,3.0,Mary Grace is smart and funny. The syllabus is non-traditional and heavier on politics and race than I expected. Her assignments can be confusing because they're open ended and she is always changing the syllabus. However she responds to emails quickly and is approachable and enthusiastic. She definitely cares about her students.
3962,1696418,Mary-Grace,Albanese,Columbia University,Not Specified,ENG270,5.0,3.0,She's pretty chill.
3963,1696418,Mary-Grace,Albanese,Columbia University,Not Specified,ENG270,5.0,2.0,Prof Albanese doesn't give much reading but she makes makes us talk a lot. Pretty laidback.

Her lectures are boring and we were graded on two papers, one was only 2 pages and the other was 5-7, and attendance. You don't have to do any of the readings except for the ones you're writing your paper on. She's also an easy grader. The only reason I showed up to class was for the attendance points"
3967,17676,Herbert,Terrace,Columbia University,Psychology,PSYCW1001,4.0,3.0,"Curious fellow. He'll call for commentary on a viewpoint only to flat-out tell the pupil they're irrevocably wrong, and himself right.

He's opinionated, but if you don't take it personally you'll discover that he's teaching you *how* to think, not *what* to think. While he tends to talk over people, just be patient.

4012,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVC7103,5.0,4.0,"Barbara is an amazing professor: caring, understanding, and simply amazing! Her discussions are always insightful and thought-provoking. She gives great feedback for your work and is always accessible outside of class. While participation somewhat matters, you won't regret taking any of her classes."
4013,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,PSC,5.0,1.0,What a sweet and caring human being. She is very compassionate and considerate of others.
4014,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,POLISCI,5.0,2.0,"I took her for my internship seminar at City College. Leave it to a Columbia Professor to let me have any great memories of CCNY. Unlike any other professors at CCNY, Professor Simon was very thoughtful and caring towards her students. You read great short stories and discuss them. Will miss this class."
4015,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT8801,5.0,5.0,Best professor in the school. Take a class with her if you get the chance. She is brilliant. All of her lectures are straight from her head. She has every historical date memorized from the past 400 years. So warm and empathetic. So helpful. I loved her so much that I made sure I took more classes with her just because she was the professor.
4016,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVOCACY,5.0,2.0,She is the BEST professor I've had at CUSSW. Take a class with her.
4017,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVC7103,1.5,1.0,I was really disappointed with this class. All we did was watch movies every week and then talk about them. We had to buy 4 brand new textbooks (costing over $200) and we rarely discussed them in class.
4018,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,SWSECT,5.0,5.0,"Excellent professor, a luminary, clone her!!!"
4019,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVOCSECT,1.0,5.0,"Class Advocacy! irrelevant class readings. no lecture at all. class consisted of only boring discussions. felt like a clinical class. do not take it! i have heard she is a bit better in other subjects, but this one was terrible"
4020,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,VARIOUS,5.0,3.0,"If you have the opportunity to take a class, ANY class, with Barbara Simon, DO NOT PASS IT UP!! She is probably one of the two or three best teachers at the school-- a feeling shared unanimously by all. She is also a tremendous human being, brilliant and wise. When you are with her, you feel like you are in the presence of greatness."
4021,510536,Barbara,Simon,Columbia University,Social Work,FOUNDATIONS,4.5,3.0,"Great class, but no direction. Learn more grammar than ever before."
4023,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,SWT7100,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Marks always emphasizes empathy and humanity. She does not use the term ""client"" because of its potential dehumanization of people. She interacts with you during your roleplay practices to brainstorm response options, which was very enlightening. She is very other-centered. She welcomed us on the first day with homemade cake and warm hugs."
4024,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,FOUNDT710,2.0,1.0,"Prof Marks utilizes her long career of direct service work in class. She gives you that radical 1960s social worker vibe. Her class is like story time with Aunt Judith. However, she is massively disorganized which is odd since she has been teaching here for so long. The assignments are easy. It was an easy A but sadly I did not learn much."
4025,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT7100,4.0,1.0,"Professor Marks is a caring and wise woman. The class is mainly discussion, alongside short papers every so often. Professor Marks facilitates deep group discussions and role plays to prepare for role play assessment mid-term. I would take another class with her."
4026,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,ADV7103,4.5,2.0,"Professor Marks is one of the most passionate professors at CUSSW. I truly enjoyed her class and learned so much. I am really proud of all of the progress that I, and my classmates, have made this semester and Professor Marks helped us every step of the way. This course truly enhances students' potential as professional social work practioners."
4027,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,FOUNDT710,2.5,1.0,"I was looking forward this course for foundations, but sadly did not learn much. I was envious of other classes that seemed to ACTUALLY be learning the DSM, assessments, diagnosis, and clinical work. The class felt like a place to hangout, and talk about our experience at field. Not helpful in my leaning b/c there was no incentive in doing well."
4028,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,SW4,2.5,3.0,"Extremely disappointed.  She has a lovely personality- just as others said- cares about students, good will, etc., but she is extremely disorganized.  My sensibilities seem to be too different from hers for us to create much a rapport."
4029,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7109,5.0,3.0,Best professor I have ever had. I credit every good practice I have as a Social Worker to Judith. She cares about you as a student and a person
4030,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,ADVT6,3.5,1.0,"She is available,nice, knowlegeable but a little disorganized"
4032,523926,Judith,Marks,Columbia University,Social Work,T660A,4.0,1.0,Great class discussions.  She really ties the topics into human behavior as a whole.
4033,769553,L. Don,McVinney,Columbia University,Social Work,T7302003,3.0,1.0,Professor McVinney was great! He has a unique teaching style that goes off more of his own field experiences. We didn't get through all the slides. For some this may not be best (I thought I'd have trouble when I read a similar review) but it turned out to be perfect for me. I learned a lot and really enjoyed his class!
4034,769553,L. Don,McVinney,Columbia University,Social Work,T7302SUBSTABUSE,3.0,1.0,"I really enjoyed his class! That being said before taking his class be sure to know what's your best learning style. In my opinion his is more from experience, which is really insightful and one can easily relate to. He does go off on tangents but he has a lot of knowledge and loves to teach students. If you need more structure take someone else."
4035,769553,L. Don,McVinney,Columbia University,Social Work,SOWK001,2.0,4.0,People rave about him because he barely requires any work from you. I didn't like his class or his style of teaching.
4036,769553,L. Don,McVinney,Columbia University,Social Work,SOWK001,2.5,1.0,"Tangential but interesting stories, never finished on time"
4037,769553,L. Don,McVinney,Columbia University,Social Work,ALC7102,4.5,2.0,He's great! If u can take him for alcohol &amp; other chem. dep. you should!

4041,769553,L. Don,McVinney,Columbia University,Social Work,SOWK0000,5.0,3.0,"Professor McVinney was, by far, my favorite teacher at CUSSW.  He has extensive experience, keeps your attention and he helps students learn practical skills for the field."
4042,769553,L. Don,McVinney,Columbia University,Social Work,T7102,5.0,3.0,McVinney is a fantastic lecturer! He is so knowledgable and has extensive experience.  You have fun in his class and he encourages a lot of discussion.  I highly recommend him for any course.
4043,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,ARTHUM,5.0,4.0,"Tina is one of the best professors I have had at Columbia. She has an excellent command of the material. Her lectures are interesting and organized, along with slides &amp; reading material.  She works hard to help her students do well in the class.  Her thoughtful comments on assigned papers are extraordinarily helpful.  I highly recommend Tina!"

The clarity with which Tina delivers the course material is brilliant, and she helps you frame and articulate your arguments really well. I strongly recommend her class."
4046,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,HUMAW1121,5.0,4.0,"Tina Rivers is the best teacher I've had at Columbia  and one of the best teachers I've ever had, period. She's an incredibly knowledgeable, no-nonsense instructor. Seriously, if you have the chance to take her class, DO IT. 
 
 Readings for every class, two major papers, a difficult midterm, and a final project. It's Art Humanities at its finest."
4047,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,NYARAHIS,5.0,4.0,A spectacular professor!  She gave the most concise and brilliant explanation on how to write a compelling essay (any type of essay)I've ever heard.   She is a total rock-star professor who thinks clearly and is delightfully organized.  Can't recomend her classes enough!
4048,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,HUMA1121,5.0,4.0,Fantastic teacher!!!
4049,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,ART1121,5.0,3.0,Tina is a phenomenal professor. I came into her class confused by and disinterested in art history and left looking to take another art class. I learned so much with her.
4050,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,S1121,5.0,1.0,"Tina is the perfect TA to have if you are taking this class as a requirement. Not only is she super hot and extremely articulate, she can tell you where to listen to the best house music in the city. Her passion for EVERYTHING is super contagious and no matter how disinterested in art history you are,I promise you will walk away blown away inspired"
4051,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,AHIS3681,5.0,2.0,"Great TA, easy to understand and very good at explaining difficult topics. Fair grader and easily approached. Highly recommended."
4052,1119096,Tina,Rivers Ryan,Columbia University,Art History,ARTHUM,5.0,3.0,"you'd be a fool not to take her class.  she is super smart, generous with her time, and makes art history fun, as cheesy as that sounds.  the best."

4062,207255,Richard,Betts,Columbia University,Political Science,EMPAU8500,1.0,3.0,"Not a subject matter expert. Does not answer any questions. All feedback on the papers is about grammar. Don't take the class! The name and the subject are very interesting, but you will learn nothing from the class. All readings are outdated and everything he ever said proved wrong. Definitely is a no go class."
4063,207255,Richard,Betts,Columbia University,Political Science,POLS4895,4.0,4.0,"Professor Betts makes you work for it, but he's absolutely brilliant and very respected by his students and the faculty. He knows what he's doing and while the class itself is tough, you get the grade that you deserve based on how much work you put in. He is very nice, although intimidating, and is always happy to help."
4064,207255,Richard,Betts,Columbia University,Political Science,U6871,3.5,4.0,"Great class, great perspective, even if international institutions and technology get short shrift. Tough class but worth it. Great survey course, and even if some of the readings seem a bit dated they stimulate great discussions."
4065,207255,Richard,Betts,Columbia University,Political Science,U6871,1.5,4.0,Not very good at teaching. Not very approachable. Classes are like 2 hours of storytelling. Doesn't like questions and doesn't give a thorough response. His courses encourage little interaction with a course materials. Heavy readings but little engagement with content in class.
4066,207255,Richard,Betts,Columbia University,Political Science,WAR,4.0,4.0,He almost failed me but he was a great prof.
4067,207255,Richard,Betts,Columbia University,Political Science,INTERNATIONAL,4.0,1.0,"This guy is an IDIOT! His idealistic approach to international politics is an utter joke!

4071,289030,Alan,Blaer,Columbia University,Physics,6036,5.0,1.0,Alan is a legent and by far the best teacher I ever had. I took 2 courses in Electromagnetism with him in 1982-83 and I still remember and use his lecture....

4074,289030,Alan,Blaer,Columbia University,Physics,PHYSICS,5.0,2.0,"Professor Blaer is one of the best teachers I have ever had.  His lectures are incredibly clear and he is tremendously helpful both as a lecturer and at his office hours.  I have no hesitation in giving him my highest recommendation.  Columbia is lucky to have him, he is a great teacher who really cares about students."
4075,289030,Alan,Blaer,Columbia University,Physics,PHYSICS,5.0,2.0,"2 words: THE BEST!!! Not only is he an excellent teacher, he's SUUUUUUUUPPPPPEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR nice, and he looks so adorable..u just wanna pinch his cheeks!"

4082,694005,Elizabeth,Currid,Columbia University,Architecture,URBAN,4.5,3.0,she is an amazing professor and is very passionate about her work. you will learn so much from her. i couldn't recommend her more.
4083,694005,Elizabeth,Currid,Columbia University,Architecture,SOCIALECONOMIC,5.0,1.0,One of the most interesting and thought provoking classes that I have ever attended. The sheer extent of her knowledge and keen insight never fails to impress.
4084,694005,Elizabeth,Currid,Columbia University,Architecture,URBAN,5.0,2.0,I concur. Beautiful and brilliant. And so sweet and helpful!
4085,694005,Elizabeth,Currid,Columbia University,Architecture,URBANPOLICY,5.0,3.0,Elizabeth is by far the best looking TA at Columbia. I had a total crush on her. She's also one of the smartest people I know. She's truely the full package.

4089,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,HIS14,5.0,5.0,"Halvorson is terrific!  Be prepared to work very hard in his class, but the depth of feedback is great.  He was trained as a philosopher so think about that when you talk with him, he loves logical arguments."
4090,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,BARD500,5.0,5.0,"I'm guessing this is the same Seth David Halvorson who teaches at Bard.  He is a treasure.  I can say with a great deal of certainty that Dr. H is one of the greatest teachers and minds I have encountered.  He is brilliant yet approachable- and he is very attentive to issues of race, gender, and class.  We should clone him."
4091,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,SEMINAR,5.0,5.0,Dr. Halvorson is the best teacher you will ever have in your life.  Do your homework.  Do your reading.  You will get so much out of this class.
4092,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,HIS14,5.0,2.0,He's a great teacher
4093,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,CONTE076,5.0,5.0,I did not take full advantage of having SDH as my professor.  Iff you have him: Do the reading.  All of it.  He cares about his students deeply. Do the recommended readings.  I only realize my mistake now.   He is hard but fair and friendly.  He actually exhibits the good will that Kant talked about. No joke.  He is the good will.
4094,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,ENG303,4.5,4.0,"He was great- quick and diligent. He never stopped and thus, there was never a dull moment. And he explains everything really well. He is also really helpful with essays."
4095,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,CC0001,5.0,5.0,"If you get a chance to take a class from Seth, you should.  I am a better thinker and writer because of it.  He is tough, but fair and you want to do the work- he is awesome."
4096,763609,Seth,Halvorson,Columbia University,Philosophy,CC57,5.0,4.0,"So far, Prof. Halvorson is the best teacher I have had at Columbia, or anywhere."

4099,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,SWK7501,1.0,4.0,Too rigid and machine like. Has no empathy for student in struggle. To the point and lazer focused on weekly topic. Rarely talks about oppression and inequity as it relates to practice. Very bright but needs to meet students where there are.
4100,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,SWT6416,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Jethwani is direct and to-the-point. She is not your friend, but she is there to help you. She is very knowledgeable about evaluations and has a lot of real-world experience. Class wasn't much ""fun,"" but you learn. Never opened the textbook, but reading the weekly article is necessary. Semester-long group project encompasses all class grades."
4101,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW660A,5.0,4.0,"If you want to work with adolescents, take this professor! She is so clearly knowledgeable on this subject and her lectures are really engaging. She definitely expects participation, effort, and deeper thinking from her students, but she is a really brilliant facilitator and lecturer. Be prepared to have something to contribute about the readings!"
4102,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,T660A,4.0,4.0,"Professor Jethwani is a really great professor. There are a lot of readings and class participation counts. If she feels the class is not reading, she will give a pop quiz. Luckily, our class was very engaged and participated often. No exams, just a interview check in, thesis proposal, and paper."
4103,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT660A,3.0,4.0,"Monique is a great professor, but not the warm kind who I would go to for advice. She keeps herself distant from her students but was a wealth of knowledge. Haven't even opened the Textbook but she gives LOTS of readings. Make sure you read at least one and have something to say. She will give a pop quiz if she thinks people aren't reading."
4104,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,T660A,4.0,5.0,"There is only one paper, and unfortunately, this professor and the 3rd one in the 3-module course didn't focus on the Developmental Life Course as much as Prof. Cogburn did. This was detrimental to students writing the paper, but that is a whole separate rating, to be honest."
4105,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,HBSEB,2.5,2.0,She is way too boring. Lectures are so dry and uninteresting! I would really advise against taking this class.
4106,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,T660A,4.0,2.0,"Nice enough, clear, and fair. My only real complaint about Professar Jethwani is that although her lectures had generally interesting subject matter, they were extremely dry which made engaging difficult."
4107,1804185,Monique,Jethwani-Keyser,Columbia University,Social Work,SWK7501,5.0,2.0,"I had her for Clinical Case Evaluation, she was outstanding and extremely knowledgeable . I highly recommend her. Only negative was that the class was too big (50 students) for graduate level."

4110,1844716,Homayoon,Beigi,Columbia University,Computer Science,COMSE6998,5.0,4.0,"I don't have a strong background in Info theory and math, so I have to study hard (really hard) for that part of the material. Luckily, Professor Beigi is super knowledgable; his lecture and book cover everything in detail. The knowledge covered by the course is about three times more than regular course. You will learn A LOT if you want to."
4111,1844716,Homayoon,Beigi,Columbia University,Computer Science,COMSE6998,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Beigi is by far one of the most inspirational people you can hope to come across. He teaches the course with passion &amp; genuinely cares about advancing the knowledge of students. Morn, night, holiday or not, he works tirelessly to answer queries. I highly recommend his lectures. Also, he truly cares that you do well in life. A gem of a person!"
4112,1844716,Homayoon,Beigi,Columbia University,Computer Science,COMSE6998,5.0,3.0,"Professor Beigi is one of the smartest and most approachable professors I have met at Columbia. He genuinely wants his students to learn, and his passion for speech recog is apparent. His office hours are strongly attended as he sits with students one-on-one to make sure theyre on track. He is a very well-liked and respected professor on campus."
4113,1844716,Homayoon,Beigi,Columbia University,Computer Science,COMSE6998,5.0,2.0,Heard of walking-talking encyclopedia? This is him! He was THE most knowledgeable professor I have seen in Columbia. From signal processing to machine learning to NLP - he's got it all in his head. Lemme demonstrate how helpful he is: He would take your laptop to save your life and fix your problems AND explain what went wrong.  Respect!
4114,1844716,Homayoon,Beigi,Columbia University,Computer Science,COMSE6998,5.0,2.0,Professor Homayoon Beigi had the patience to explain key concepts  and guide me throughout the semester. The content was really intimidating at first  but I  started to understand key concepts as the semester progressed. This was one of the best classes with a mix of both practice and theory. He has real passion for the subject area.  Rare in sch
4115,1844716,Homayoon,Beigi,Columbia University,Computer Science,COMSE6998,5.0,3.0,"Professor Beigi is the most brilliant professor I have had so far!  He is extremely knowledgeable on many different topics, which is great for such a multidisciplinary course.  He is very approachable and unbelievably kind, with great drive to make sure everyone understands every bit of material.  His textbook is superb and a great reference."
4116,1844716,Homayoon,Beigi,Columbia University,Computer Science,COMP675,5.0,3.0,"As a grad student who has switched my major/school twice, and while having interacted with many student peers, many in his course, I can only convey the real sense of appreciation we all have toward his Witt,intellect, multi-levels of knowledge.. from fundamental sciences to engineering &amp;entrepreneurship.     super bright &amp; one of a kind indeed!"

 genuine interest in their students, which is honestly why I remain enrolled. It's one of the few courses where the professor's enthusiasm and passion for the subject matter was contagious."
4118,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX4199004,5.0,2.0,"I got so much out of this class. From the wide range of meditation exercises to the dynamic class discussions and in-class debate, this course was appropriately challenging, exceptionally thought-provoking, and always engaging. Excellent survey of the exciting field of Positive Psychology, presenting a wide range of cutting-edge research. Awesome!"
4119,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX4199004,5.0,3.0,"Very informative, engaging, and thought provoking course! He was helpful in responding to the questions that everyone had during our class and responded well to emails. He was open to everyone's different interpretations of the articles and created a safe space to share your opinions. Great guided meditation series throughout the class!"
4120,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX4199004,5.0,1.0,"Instructor held space very well in an inclusive fashion while also guiding and providing helpful feedback on subject matter. The instructor has both an in-depth and very sophisticated knowledge in the field but also exhibits passion for the material and topics. He is also very engaging, sincere and cares about his student's learning experience."
4121,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX41994,4.5,2.0,"I learned so much about a new spectrum in clinical psychology. The theories were interesting, but the whole roundedness and his passion for this research area were inspirational. Experiencing mindfulness through each class session offer very new vibe to my TC courses. He is a greatteacher and a true advocate who believes in positivity in our lives."
4122,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX4499004,5.0,4.0,Professor Barton inspired me to create a daily habit of mindfulness and consider positive psychology as an important facet in a broad range of modalities and treatments. Yakov explained concepts very well. He created a class space that was structured while at the same time encouraging for students to freely express thoughts without judgement.
4123,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX4199004,5.0,1.0,"Great class, with very interesting discussions. The professor put a lot of effort into keeping it interesting and every session was value adding. Great group discussion and interesting assignments. The professor managed to create a great atmophere in the class. I would always take this class again."
4124,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,2010562,5.0,1.0,Yakov is an amazing resource  within the positive psychology field.  His positive psychology class is uniquely positioned to showcase his extensive experience with the best mindfulness training techniques that combine leading psychology research with age-old meditation knowledge.
4125,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX419903,4.5,4.0,"Positive Psychology was a class for which I had very high expectations, and Dr. Barton matched them all. I am so grateful to have learned so much about PosPsy, and the readings were almost universally great. His lectures are clear and he is very supportive inout of class. But he is a tougher grader than he appears, and his tests can be tricky."
4126,2010562,Yakov,Barton,Columbia University,Psychology,CCPX41994,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Barton's Positive Psychology class at Columbia University, Teachers College. Uses a fascinating approach to teaching positive psychology material, including experiential meditationrelaxation exercises, lectures, group activities, films, and a class debate on the current state of the field. Learned a ton, highly recommended!"
4128,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,U9000,5.0,4.0,"Kirsti did an amazing job to guide us in our capstone project and provided valuable knowledge and feedback throughout the semester. We had to put in the work, but with Kirstis support paid off with a solid published report. I think any course with her as a lecturer would be interesting, especially since she has a wealth of knowledge/experience."
4129,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,U9000,5.0,4.0,"I found Kirsti to be an excellent Capstone advisor: she is critical, but her criticism is constructive, specific and never arbitrary. Unlike many professors, she took the time to review our work product and give us helpful feedback as well as help us decide on a clear strategy for the research and analysis portion of the work."
4130,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,SIPAU9000,5.0,4.0,"Kirsti provided valuable guidance as an advisor to our team. I was disappointed that I didn't get the grade I wanted as I put in a lot of work. That aside, she was very thoughtful in handling the team, taking the time for healthy team dynamics and getting to know us. She skillfully balanced being an expert and giving us control of the project."
4131,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,SIPAU9000,4.0,4.0,The professor supported us in writing a great capstone project that was published. Hard work. long hours.
4132,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,SIPAU9000,5.0,4.0,"Capstones are intensive,but Dr. Samuels made the project manageable. She has a wealth of knowledge and practical experience that she was willing and open to sharing. She took time to learn each of her students. She played up our strengths and assisted us in navigating through our challenges. Great teacher; Seasoned professional; Highly recommended."
4133,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,SIPAU9000,1.0,3.0,"Kirsti seemed disengaged and unavailable and provided little to no guidance to the team during the project. While she has an interesting CV, I did not feel like I learnt anything from her."
4134,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,SIPAU9000,5.0,4.0,"Kirsti was a great instructor. Her feedback on work was thoughtful and grounded in her wealth of experience in both peacebuilding and leadership development. She knew each student well, and was conscious of our group dynamics. (Note the bad reviews come from folks who declined to provide their grade. You get out what you put in.)"
4135,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,SIPAU9000,5.0,4.0,"Kirsti is a wonderful professor and leader. She is very intentional, giving strategic guidance when needed, but also giving teams space to figure things out. Our team had an emergency abroad, and Kirsti went above and beyond to give us the tools to deal with the situation, provide support &amp; show compassion. I would recommend her class to everyone."
4136,2331374,Kirsti,Samuels,Columbia University,Political Science,SIPAU9000,5.0,4.0,"Kirsti is a seasoned peace-building professional. She is knowledgeable of the theory and the practicalities of the field, which makes her a great tutor for a graduate course. I can only imagine that a course with her would be not only interesting but intellectually challenging."
4138,703632,Richard,Pena,Columbia University,Film,FILMW4008,5.0,3.0,"The most amazing professor I've ever had, honestly. He's so well spoken and he can answer any question you have about film history or really anything it seems. The films he picks are amazing, take his class!!!!"
4139,703632,Richard,Pena,Columbia University,Film,FILMAF5015,4.0,3.0,Prof. Pena is a living encyclopedia of film history. His choice of films is very unique and aims for broaden the horizon of the students. Short paper for each film per week. He will provide very productive comments and feedback.
4140,703632,Richard,Pena,Columbia University,Film,FILMW4008,3.0,4.0,"This is a really tough class.  He is notoriously tough grader but what's worse is amount of writing.  A paper due every week, plus a midterm and final 10+ pages each.  Major workload, but really, it's worth it.  He is a feather in the columbia film cap and his film knowledge is second to none. If you come through CU, u have to take him."
4141,703632,Richard,Pena,Columbia University,Film,FILMW384,4.0,5.0,"Pena is a difficult guy to pin down - he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of anything film, from anywhere in the world.  But I don't think he's very good interacting one-on-one, and he can sometimes be very bad about responding to emails.  But overall, he will challenge you, expand your horizons and give you a good class experience."
4142,703632,Richard,Pena,Columbia University,Film,SPA331,1.0,3.0,"Pena was the worst professor I've ever had, which is saying a lot.  On the rare occasions that he'd allow students to talk, he was condescending and dismissive, refusing to hear any viewpoint but his own.  His lectures were tedious, his assignments unnecessarily copious, and his comments lazy and uninterested.  D-"
4143,703632,Richard,Pena,Columbia University,Film,WORLDSECT,5.0,4.0,"Knows cinema and the business inside and out - makes every movie interesting through lecture and discussion and readings, invites discussion and responds thoughtfully, creates challenging and interesting assignments, reads all the papers you turn in and makes lots of comments, funny, really nice guy"

4146,703632,Richard,Pena,Columbia University,Film,FILMINTROTO,5.0,4.0,Best lecturer I ever heard.  Ever.
4147,14071,Robert,Thurman,Columbia University,Theology,BUDD1,1.5,3.0,"The class is borderline boring and not terribly informative. The fact that the Professor obviously is too busy to be there half the time doesn't help either. The recommended/required reading list consists mostly out of books he wrote or translated. Skip this one, I?d say. Who cares who is daughter is?"
4148,14071,Robert,Thurman,Columbia University,Theology,INDOTIBETAN,5.0,4.0,"Excellent course. Go to the TA sessions to get the most out of this course. When I took the course, Prof. Thurman was available before class to answer questions, etc."

4153,14071,Robert,Thurman,Columbia University,Theology,NONDUALITY,2.0,2.0,He doesn't listen. Arrogant as hell. Nice outside of class but too busy cavorting with the Dalai Lama to make office hours.
4154,14071,Robert,Thurman,Columbia University,Theology,REL,3.0,3.0,Ducks questions about his weak arguments in his books that do no justice to the Tibetan people and their religion.
4156,19955,David,Yerkes,Columbia University,English,HUMA1002,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Yerkes is not everyone's cup o' tea... but he s got a keen intellect and his main purpose is to make you THINK!  If you think you can drift, lazily, through his class you would be wrong.  The man has been doing this for almost 40 years and knows his stuff!  Is he a hard grader?  Not particularly, but this is not an ""easy A"".  I enjoy him, YMMV!"
4157,19955,David,Yerkes,Columbia University,English,HISTENGL,1.0,2.0,"Quit caring quite a while ago, he's got the tenure &amp; has checked out. I had him for Hist. of American Lang. which was an awful course.  He basically adopts Pinker's ideas as his own &amp; ridicules the ""lesser"" Bryson. It would be one thing if Yerkes devoted himself to research (he hasn't--he's been harping on the OED for the last 10 yrs--no book yet)."
4158,19955,David,Yerkes,Columbia University,English,ENGL001,1.5,3.0,AVOID AT ALL COSTS. History of English Language is a complete joke.  He didn't even have a syllabus. Nasty &amp; grades erratically.
4159,19955,David,Yerkes,Columbia University,English,HISTENGLANG,1.0,4.0,worst teacher EVER
4161,19955,David,Yerkes,Columbia University,English,ANGLOSAXON,5.0,3.0,"His class is well and humorously taught. Yerkes has little time for students without interest looking for a gut course, but his knowledge pays off if you pay attention.  His Hist. of the Eng. Lang class also made passing the Univ. of Oxford M.Phil qualifying exam in Philology a breeze, by the way."
4163,19955,David,Yerkes,Columbia University,English,HISTLANG,5.0,3.0,"Great prof. Quirky as heck, but a keen intellectual who teaches through ancedotes. Stay focused, relax, and you'll learn a lot."

He LOVED teaching and it showed which i really respected, and hes extremely clear about what will be on a test. He's a very funny guy and wants his students to excel. He makes international economics very interesting and his method of teaching seems to work. I would highly recommend to all."
4191,942766,Giacomo,Santangelo,Columbia University,Economics,ECON3244,5.0,2.0,"I took his class at Fordham University, and he was a great professor. He makes international economics easy to understand, and his lectures are enjoyable. Only 3 tests and no homework. There is a textbook but I only used it to study before exams and still got an A. Would highly recommend."
4192,942766,Giacomo,Santangelo,Columbia University,Economics,ECON353,4.5,3.0,"Similar to previous comments, he makes public economics very easy to grasp. Seemingly random things like talking about Britney Spears, sparks up the class but some things he talks about are actually relevant to the class. Real life and engaging examples. What more can you ask for. Helpful too."

He is able to use real life examples and relate them to the material in ways that make the most complicated topics seem easy. Just do the readings and pay attention"
4196,942766,Giacomo,Santangelo,Columbia University,Economics,ECON101,5.0,1.0,Santangelo you bailed on FU for Columbia?! You will be missed...

4198,949047,Michelle,Ballan,Columbia University,Social Work,HBSE660,5.0,3.0,Absolutely wonderful professor. One of the best I have had over the course of my undergrad and grad school career. Ballan will challenge you in the best way possible and really make you think!

4206,1040045,June,Cross,Columbia University,Journalism,JOUR001,1.0,3.0,"I agree with the majority of the comments: Cross is rude, condescending and unprofessional. I came into the program with a graduate degree in another discipline. This is important because I have a lot of experience with professors and she was by far the worst I've ever had. She is so wrapped up in her own projects she could care less and it shows."
4207,1040045,June,Cross,Columbia University,Journalism,DOC101,1.0,4.0,"According to this ""professor"", if you're thick-skinned, an extroverted bully who knows how to gossip well-enough, then you're a good journalist. All these attributes are whats wrong with journalism in America today. Being rude - even if it's used as a shield - never makes a journalist real. If you want to be one like the rest, take her class"
4208,1040045,June,Cross,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,2.5,4.0,"As many have said above- while she holds students to high standards, she is extremely condescending, rude, and unprofessional. While she does push you to achieve, it is more driven out of fear of being made fun of, talked down to, or screamed at (yes that happens, obscenities are usually involved). Really inappropriate for an adult and teacher."
4209,1040045,June,Cross,Columbia University,Journalism,DOC101,1.0,2.0,"Unprofessional and disrespectful. Producing a documentary about her life doesn't make her experienced and producing another with a frontline team does not give her a green light to abuse her students. While I took her class last year, I still can't get over how little I learned from her. I don't recommend this teacher."
4210,1040045,June,Cross,Columbia University,Journalism,RWI,1.0,2.0,"Cross's irrational moody disrespectful attitude over shadows the very little wisdom or knowledge she may show sporadically during the semester. If you're paying a fortune to be in this school, don't waste your money on any of her classes."
4211,1040045,June,Cross,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,3.5,5.0,"Prof. Cross is a no-nonsense professor who holds her students up to the highest standards... as she should.  Having come into her class with prior experience, I found her teaching methods helpful, but not sure how those new to the game were able to keep up.  Worth taking her class if you are dedicated to becoming a better journalist."
4212,1040045,June,Cross,Columbia University,Journalism,DOC101,1.5,2.0,"Really undedicated, insensitive to the fact the students aren't professionals yet, can't be bothered to help because she's too caught up in her own projects. Very mean spirited too. A total nightmare and it's too bad because so many people want to learn about documentary and she's a horrible teacher."
4215,1662101,Richard,Hara,Columbia University,Social Work,T7102,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've had at CSSW thus far. Incredibly kind and smart, and often quite funny. His lectures can be a bit dry at times, but I found there was always something to be learned from whatever Dr. Hara was saying. He seemed to carefully integrate feedback from students into the course, and made sure what we were learning was useful."
4216,1662101,Richard,Hara,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6910,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors in the Columbia school of social work program! Do yourself a favor and take him, especially for health care policy!"

4218,1662101,Richard,Hara,Columbia University,Social Work,SOWT6910,5.0,3.0,"I seriously lucked out by taking Professor Hara for health care policy! He fostered a welcoming classroom environment, which allowed for interactive learning process.

4219,1662101,Richard,Hara,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT6910,5.0,2.0,"I am so happy I took Professor Hara for my health care policy class!! He made the subject of policy easy to comprehend and his assignments/readings were interesting and relevant to the current sociopolitical climate. He was as well very understanding and clear in his grading requirements, do yourself a favor and take him!!"
4220,1662101,Richard,Hara,Columbia University,Social Work,DIRECTPRACTICE,5.0,2.0,Dr. Hara is knowledgeable and extremely thoughtful. His teaching style is collaborative and he is extremely fair in grading. I learned so much form the class and his personal experiences. I loved the class!
4221,1662101,Richard,Hara,Columbia University,Social Work,FNDT003,4.5,1.0,"Professor Hara is extremely thoughtful, well-spoken and attentive to student needs.  His approach is though-provoking and collaborative as he encourages students to provide input and direct class conversation through their contributions.  Professor Hara is attuned to the finer points of social work such as psychodynamics, use of self, ethics, etc."
4222,1662101,Richard,Hara,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7100,2.0,1.0,"While Prof. Hara is nice and means well, his classes are extremely boring and dry. We spent the entire time on our laptops looking at Facebook. He doesn't have enough variety in his lectures. That said, he's a pretty easy grader."

4227,1463758,Stuart,Ward,Columbia University,Statistics,STATISTICS,5.0,2.0,I walked into the class terrified and left ready to take another class with Stu! Absolutely recommend his Statistics course.
4228,1463758,Stuart,Ward,Columbia University,Statistics,U6311,5.0,3.0,Best Quantitative Analysis professor I ever had. Before attending Columbia I took Quant at NYU. Profeesor Ward taught me more in two weeks than I learned in an entire semester at NYU. He is not the run of the mill conventional professor. But his methods are effective and my learning has been sustained for 9 years.

4235,2016468,Seyhan,Erden,Columbia University,Economics,ECON4413,2.0,3.0,"Look at the dates of the previous reviews and draw your own conclusion about whether they are real.  Erden is not a good lecturer (and, might I add, not a Professor at all). She bungles the most basic equations on the blackboard, and is rarely available for feedback outside of class. Don't believe this rating for a second."
4236,2016468,Seyhan,Erden,Columbia University,Economics,4413,3.0,4.0,not very clear sometimes.

4242,1996955,Jarron,Magallanes,Columbia University,Social Work,T7501,1.0,4.0,Literally so insensitive. So rude. Not at all caring or considerate. Very heavy reliance of self study and readings. Does not cover everything in lecture.
4243,1996955,Jarron,Magallanes,Columbia University,Social Work,SW7501,5.0,2.0,PLEASE TAKE HIM IF YOU LIKE GETTING As - Hands down one of the BEST professors you can ever get in grad school.

4247,1996955,Jarron,Magallanes,Columbia University,Social Work,T7100,5.0,3.0,Prof. Jarron is one of the best professors I have ever had. He goes above and beyond to be a supportive pillar for his students. I reached out to him on weekends and he responded promptly. He makes a 3 hour class interesting. I absolutely adore him and you will too. The whole class loves him. I am taking his class again next term. Don't miss out!
4248,1996955,Jarron,Magallanes,Columbia University,Social Work,7102,5.0,2.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM. So helpful in and outside of class.
4249,1996955,Jarron,Magallanes,Columbia University,Social Work,T7102,4.0,2.0,As an international student professor Magallanes was very helpful to me outside of class to help me understand the course better

4252,207262,Eric,Foner,Columbia University,History,2004,5.0,3.0,By far the best class I ever took was Foner's seminar.  It made all the**** at Columbia worth the outrageous tuition.

4257,207769,Richard,Pious,Columbia University,Political Science,POLSC1,5.0,5.0,"every other professor pales in comparison to Dr. Pious. He is absolutely the best teacher I have ever had including grad school. If only all my teachers were as smart and as effective teachers as he was, I would be an Einstein by now."
4258,207769,Richard,Pious,Columbia University,Political Science,POLS4316,5.0,4.0,The most intelligent professor I have ever encountered. Stories are very interesting. A lot of work but it's worth it
4259,207769,Richard,Pious,Columbia University,Political Science,CONST1,5.0,5.0,"THE BEST OF THE BEST. No TAs, you get a real feedback from a professor. Superb scholar; his lectures are the most fascinating lectures ever. He really cares about you &amp; is glad to clarify the material. He actually teaches you; what I learned in his class got me through my pol sci major. I learned in his class more than I did in all others combined."
4260,207769,Richard,Pious,Columbia University,Political Science,PRESCONGR,5.0,5.0,"If you have come to the University to learn, then there are few professors who you should rather than a class from than professor Pious. He knows what he is talking about, demands that his students learn, but gives you the tools to do it with. You will come out knowing more than when you went in, and that is the goal of going to a school like columbia. If you are there to play, to put your feet up on the chair, and get offended easily, go to another class or school. he treats you like and adult and expects"
4262,207769,Richard,Pious,Columbia University,Political Science,USPRESIDENTS,2.5,4.0,"Has his shtick down pat. But, it comes loaded with condescension, arbitrary exercises of authority, and a retrograde ""best and brightest"" attitude about government &amp; Ivy League schools."

I truely respect Professor Armstrong and his class due to the fact that he is the most prestigious professor in this field. Taking his class was one of the best choices in my life. Thank you Professor Armstrong for the friendliness!!^^
4268,321183,Charles,Armstrong,Columbia University,History,UN1363,2.0,5.0,"One of the toughest professors at Columbia. To get an A from his course, a ton of efforts would be required. Very profound readings difficult to understand even for Koreans. Never ever recommend his every course :("
4269,321183,Charles,Armstrong,Columbia University,History,HIST001,2.0,4.0,The readings in this Vietnam War seminar were outstanding.  The professor is extremely inconsistent with grading and he offers little valuable feedback until way after the middle of the term.

4276,470165,Luis,Gravano,Columbia University,Computer Science,3139,4.5,3.0,One of the best professors I've ever had. Both as an undergrad and a graduate.  There are not many professors as good and helpful as Professor Gravano in any university I've attended.

4279,471974,Edward,Mendelson,Columbia University,English,HUMAC1001,4.0,2.0,"He's a genius. However,  he's getting old and he repeats himself a lot, and sometimes his instructions are a little confusing. But he will always try hard to explain better if you ask. He really knows his stuff, but he wants you to really put your all into the class, especially the essays. "
4280,471974,Edward,Mendelson,Columbia University,English,ENGL3225,4.5,3.0,Mostly awesome lectures about Virginia Woolf. Never thought I would care. But I did.
4281,471974,Edward,Mendelson,Columbia University,English,ENGL3274,4.5,3.0,"One of the reasons I came to Columbia University. Intense teacher, good readings, spent a lot of time on our writing. Easy to talk to. Doesn't read from notes, so not always tightly organized. A good one, all in all."
4282,471974,Edward,Mendelson,Columbia University,English,ENGL3220,4.5,2.0,"Pretty easy-going, esp. about grading and deadlines. Some lectures were exciting and intense, but not always. Very sharp and quick, lots of information, likes dialoging with students. I liked this class."
4283,471974,Edward,Mendelson,Columbia University,English,ENGL,1.5,1.0,"He is by far the dumbest guy in the Columbia English department, and this makes him insecure. He is so condescending, that he will correct your grammer in a nasty way that makes you so nervous, you can't even get your comment/question out. Also, you can't go to the bathroom during class, wear a hat, click your pen or come in a minute late."
4284,471974,Edward,Mendelson,Columbia University,English,ENGLW3257,4.0,3.0,"i highly recommend this proff, especially this class.

4288,645921,Sandy,Padwe,Columbia University,Journalism,RW1,4.5,5.0,"Prof. Padwe is the best teacher at Columbia. He cares so much about his students, forces you to be at your best, and is always available to you for help. No one cares more about students than he does. If you get him, you've won the lottery. He is amazing, inspiring and a lifelong friend in journalism."
4289,645921,Sandy,Padwe,Columbia University,Journalism,SPORTS,5.0,5.0,He really cares and you will learn a lot.
4292,645921,Sandy,Padwe,Columbia University,Journalism,SPORTSJOURN,5.0,5.0,"He can seem harsh and strict, but is a great teacher you will grow to love. He is serious about what he does and what you will do. He is always available and give great feedback."

4295,811194,David,Blum,Columbia University,Journalism,JRNCNS,5.0,3.0,"Blum is amazing. He really knows how to inspire you with his honesty. Very funny, too. Younger and cooler than most of the j-school profs."
4296,811194,David,Blum,Columbia University,Journalism,MAGAZ001,5.0,4.0,"Blum is funny and laid back, but he'll make you think and he'll give you as much time as you need.  He'll improve your writing -- and your confidence in yourself."

4301,1011364,Roger,Mesznik,Columbia University,Business,INTROBUSFINECON,4.0,1.0,"I took the High School summer course Introduction to Business, Finance and Economics. It was EXTREMELY easy. The class was more of a think outside the box class than economics, but the TAs provided a larger econ component."
4302,1011364,Roger,Mesznik,Columbia University,Business,FINC8307,4.5,5.0,He is good professor but not easily to deal with. He explains  everything very clearly and hold the class attention every time.
4303,1011364,Roger,Mesznik,Columbia University,Business,CORPFINANCE,5.0,4.0,"An amazing professor. Brings out the best in the Executive MBA classes he teaches and captivates the class. If you have the opportunity take his class, you won't regret it!"
4304,1011364,Roger,Mesznik,Columbia University,Business,BIS101,2.0,1.0,"Roger Mesznik is a smart man. That said it is a terrible teacher. An afternoon on wikipedia enlightens one more. He likes to make topics interesting by sharing esoteric anecdotes that are only impressive to the juvenile. A nice guy whom I would love to have a lunch with aside, the man is an expensive fun fact dispenser. Thank god for the textbook"
4305,1011364,Roger,Mesznik,Columbia University,Business,FIN101,4.0,4.0,"Very good teacher. He makes the boring aspects of corporate finance fun, and has alot of information on modern finance, current events, and even just life in general! always stays after class for a while to answer extra questions from students."
4306,1011364,Roger,Mesznik,Columbia University,Business,CF001,5.0,5.0,"Folks, after careers at georgetown and columbia, I have to say that Roger Mesznik is the best professor I have had to date. The class is Corporate Finance and he holds the class's attention from 6pm till 9:30... it wizzes by and you learn a ton!"
4308,1099545,Marion,Riedel,Columbia University,Social Work,T7102,5.0,1.0,"She comes off a little strong at the beginning but she has great intentions. I really like that when she said something wrong , she would reflect and come back to class and apologize. She is very easy grader as long as you show effort.. lots of thinking outside the box! i grew a lot personally and social justice lens"
4309,1099545,Marion,Riedel,Columbia University,Social Work,T7102,1.0,3.0,"Prof Riedel made it clear the only participation she wants is students nodding and smiling. Likes students using fluffy ""I feel..."" statements and will punish students who respectfully present cited information. Thoughtful discussion will not be tolerated and gets you shut down in class and a lower grade at the end. Arrogant and insecure."
4310,1099545,Marion,Riedel,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT7134,2.0,4.0,Professor Riedel is very opinionated and I never felt like you could disagree with anything she said. She also could be really rude to students and sometimes seemed to just snap and get angry. Wouldn't take her again.
4311,1099545,Marion,Riedel,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCWT7134,3.5,4.0,"I have taken two courses with Marion Reidel - AGPP III and Motivational Interviewing. I wasn't crazy about her style in AGPP. But in MI she is very responsive to student's learning needs, direct and has a no-nonsense style. She is not the warm-fuzzy social worker type; she will tell you what is on her mind. In the end, I learned alot!"
4312,1099545,Marion,Riedel,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW1,1.5,3.0,The best thing I can say about Prof. Riedel is that in my experience is arrogant and harbors malicious ill will towards those she disagrees with. You can infer the worst.
4313,1099545,Marion,Riedel,Columbia University,Social Work,SOC7,1.0,4.0,Class should be retitled - Professor Riedel and her soapbox. She allows little in the way of discussion and tries her damndest to quelch anything in the way of opposing opinion. Steer clear if you want to keep your sanity. You have been warned.
4314,1099545,Marion,Riedel,Columbia University,Social Work,T7102,5.0,5.0,"Gives a lot of work, but you'll learn alot. She's not afraid to have challenging discussions on issues such as race. Take her if you want to learn how to be a social worker!"

4320,1147014,Robin,Gearing,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7109,5.0,1.0,"Gearing is very personable and straight to the point. He speaks from both his experience and his education, and he does not sugar coat anything. Gearing has a real passion for his field, and he infuses it into his students. One of my favorite professors at CUSSW."
4321,1147014,Robin,Gearing,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7102,5.0,3.0,Robin makes class interesting and fun- he is very engaging.  He explains the material clearly with examples from his own practice.

4324,1457616,Enrique,Walker,Columbia University,Architecture,ARCH4804,5.0,4.0,Brilliant and utmost kind. Enrique is a role model for every student that has studied under his guidance. Columbia is lucky to have him.
4325,1457616,Enrique,Walker,Columbia University,Architecture,A4106,5.0,4.0,"Enrique is the most inspiring and intelligent teacher I have ever encountered, delicately yet effectively creating the conditions for students to engage with architecture (as well literature and art) in ways that catalyzed swerves in their intellectual trajectory and enriched the way they perceive the discipline but everything beyond it too"
4326,1457616,Enrique,Walker,Columbia University,Architecture,ARCH4804,5.0,4.0,"the best in terms of balancing academia and practice in architecture his pedagogical approach. huge learning curve, great conversations and a very pleasant time in his studio."

Very intelligent, has great topics for seminars and insightful agenda and feedback for studio. Very sympathetic to his students and respectful to his colleagues (a rarity in the Ivy League)"
4329,1457616,Enrique,Walker,Columbia University,Architecture,A4106,5.0,4.0,"He is a very dedicated and very smart professor. He is sympathetic to the students, very very nice and yet very demanding, in his way. But he is so kind and smart that his manner makes you want to work harder, it becomes very engaging. Has all these whimsical ideas with references from literature, film and art. Wonderful"
4331,1556164,Andreas,Hielscher,Columbia University,Engineering,BMEN4898,5.0,3.0,Everything you ever wanted to know about biophotonics. Includes current research topics. Great class with hands-on programming labs.

4337,1556164,Andreas,Hielscher,Columbia University,Engineering,BMEN4894,4.5,4.0,Great course - great teacher
4339,1653290,Amy,Werman,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW7102T,3.0,4.0,"Prof Werman took over my class half way through due to COVID-19 complications. She is a good teacher, though sometimes she does things last minute like emailing the class to read something 1-2 days before the next class. She also tends to not explain assignments as well as I'd like - she's also somewhat of a tough grader. Participation matters!!!!!"
4340,1653290,Amy,Werman,Columbia University,Social Work,T6501,1.0,3.0,The teaching was very unstructured and not objective. The material was challenging but the class session weren't used to discuss the content. The teaching was very disorganization and not helpful to my learning.
4341,1653290,Amy,Werman,Columbia University,Social Work,SWRESEARCHT6501,5.0,3.0,"Professor Werman comes to class prepared to make research a comprehensible and applicable subject to social work. She is enthusiastic, clear, and engaging. She welcomes questions and class participation; always welcoming different opinions and happy to re-explain concepts students have difficulty grasping."
4342,1653290,Amy,Werman,Columbia University,Social Work,PROGRAMEVAL,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Werman is very nice. However, do not confuse this with easiness. She is a strict grader and is very particular about structure and grammar. There are no make-ups or rewrites. BUT if you take the comments of the paper seriously and show significant improvement, she takes that into consideration and you will be absolutely fine."
4343,1653290,Amy,Werman,Columbia University,Social Work,T6501,2.0,1.0,"AVOID! This class is easy but Prof. Werman's teaching style is really confusing and she often contradicts herself and changes assignment details at the last minute. Also, she's a stickler for in class electronics and treats the students like it's high school all over again. I wish I had taken the waiver exam."
4344,1653290,Amy,Werman,Columbia University,Social Work,SWRESEARCHT6501,5.0,2.0,"I learned so much in this class due to the teaching method she used in class. you will walk out of the class learning what  came in for. She is attenive to her stuents and accessible after class time. She is a fair grader, clear and concise. I would recommend her for this course."
4345,1653290,Amy,Werman,Columbia University,Social Work,SOCW6501,5.0,4.0,Learned so much in this class due to teaching style of this professor. Class was always engaged. Comments on assignments were always helpful.
4347,2500304,Mizanur,Rahman,Columbia University,Biology,UN3404,3.0,5.0,Professor Rahman is an amazing professor. He gets you ready for medical school. He is very tough but in a good way as he will do whatever it takes for you to succeed. He will make you learn to take a step back and think in a new way. One of the smartest professor in the department. Just study 24/7 one week before his exam. Exams are HARD
4348,2500304,Mizanur,Rahman,Columbia University,Biology,UN3404,4.0,5.0,"He's tough. Be ready to study days nights weekends to get a good grade. When everything moved online he made sure to check up on us and was available to help. The class is tough but if you put in the work, you will do well"
4349,2500304,Mizanur,Rahman,Columbia University,Biology,UN3404,4.0,5.0,Good class and great professor. Antimicrobial resistance is a very difficult class but Prof Rahman had alot of helpful hints. Exams are tough but if you study you will be fine. Be ready to answers questions as he will randomly pick on you. He's also available outside of class and is a great person you should get to know.
4350,2500304,Mizanur,Rahman,Columbia University,Biology,VAG244,5.0,5.0,"Mizanur Rahman is an amazing professor. I think it is because he is my uncle. He gives a lot of lectures and hard tests. Sometimes he gives us a lot of homework, but who cares! it makes me smarter! I would take his class again! But I would not recommend him for people who are new to biology."
4351,2500304,Mizanur,Rahman,Columbia University,Biology,BIOLUN3058,4.0,3.0,"Prof Rahman knows how to teach really well, and tbh he changed my perspective of life. Yes he is a tough grader but he's available outside of class for anything and will help you understand. I highly recommend you get to know him if you are interested in research/med school as he does alot of clinical research and is a genius."

Yes, you will never get anything back line edited from him, but when you read out loud in class, he gives you the edits that are most important. His value is in the ear he has as a longtime editor - he know what works and what doesn't just by listening to your text. His overall wisdoms about writing and life are very valuable too."

He works to get to know each student by arranging a lunch with each of us. Taking a class with John allows a j-school student to go outside the boundaries. He's amazing, he's honest and he allows a student to feel proud about their work while criticizing all the while."
4409,770859,John,Bennet,Columbia University,Not Specified,MAGAZINE,2.5,3.0,Bennet works at the New Yorker.  He tells good stories but he makes students read their work out loud....not fun.

5940,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,5.0,1.0,"Prof Wissink's lectures might not be it, but she really cares for her students and she is accessible outside lecture so that you can easily ask questions. She gives good examples and plenty of resources, making her class easy even if you don't go. Material is posted online, including slides, and recorded lectures on Panopto. Go to class -&gt; Pass"
5941,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,1.0,3.0,"Very poor instructor--the worst one I had at Cornell. In terms of learning basic microeconomics, you could easily find a much better teacher at a public high school, a community college, or literally anywhere else. I don't think anyone would learn very much about economics from her powerpoint slides. And all she does is read them."
5942,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,4.0,2.0,"She's extremely caring, helpful, friendly, and talkative. One of the more engaging lecturers I've had. Class is easy if you're logical; I rarely went to lecture, never went to discussion, never went to OH, never touched the textbook. I learned by taking the quizzes and occasionally reviewing slides (avg 1-2 hours of work a week)."
5943,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1120,2.0,2.0,Not a great professor- basically just reads off the slides and takes a long time to go over the material. I will say that this class was really easy though. I just caught up on all the slides before the prelim and took previous exams. The exams are EXACTLY the same. Some of the same Qs show up. Same format every year. Also is extra credit :)
5944,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1101,1.0,4.0,"Hated every second. Worst explainer I've ever seen it's like from one unit to the next the explanations got worse. If you're looking to actually gain a basic understanding in economics, save yourself the trouble. You won't learn and probably will have a hard time passing if you know nothing about the subject prior to the course."
5945,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,3.0,"she is the absolute worst.... her lectures make zero sense and does not curve her exams (which are horribly written), I still have no idea what microeconomics is"
5946,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1101,2.0,4.0,"Do not take this class if you do not have a background in economics. She is obviously very knowledgable about economics, but is not good at teaching the information. She goes through material very quickly and does not seem to worry about her students understanding the material. Her tests are long and she does not curve."
5947,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON4260,1.0,4.0,"Unorganized, confusing lectures that are only taught on the chalkboard so you have to go to class. Learned more from the textbook than lecture because Wissink's style of teaching was hard to follow. No homework, only attendance/prelims/final. Would not say this is an ""easy A"" class - the material is dry and the class is very unstructured."
5948,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON4260,1.0,4.0,She is the absolute worst. Never taking a class from her again.
5949,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1120,1.0,3.0,The lectures are a waste of time. The lectures have to do nothing with the prelims. The professor and TA are bad explaining questions. They understand what they are doing but there is a gap in the transfer of knowledge. The TAs don't know how to answer simple questions and Wissink's lectures don't help. Take any ECON class from another professor.
5950,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1120,2.0,2.0,"Boring class, I only attended 5 or 6 lectures all semester and did just fine by watching the panopto recordings. You can get an A by doing the MEL quizzes (which are long but very easy) and studying from past papers - the questions in prelims and the final are mostly the same every year."
5951,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1100,2.0,4.0,"Wissink has been pleasant to me in my personal interactions w/ her, however I don't think she's a very good Prof. Her exams are written in a way that is so confusing- the wording usually makes little sense. She provides a bunch of supplementary material to understand the material but that doesn't help if you don't understand the exam questions...."
5952,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,1.0,5.0,"Is deciding if she's going to curve our grades based on our ""behavior."" A psychotic and manipulative professor."

5954,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1120,1.0,3.0,Horrible professor
5955,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1120,5.0,2.0,Her lectures are clear. Just study past prelims then review them for the final and you'll be good.
5956,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,2.0,Had her for 1110 and 1120. Lectures are not terribly interesting but they cover most of what is on the exam. Homework is easy points so don't miss out. Also offers iclicker extra-credit. Textbook is useful for reviewing info but not terribly necessary. Be sure to do the practice tests and psets before the exam.
5957,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1120,2.0,3.0,"Confusing lecturer, though its obvious she's passionate about economics"
5958,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,4.0,"She uses terrible examples for what she talks about. She rushes through lectures and her example pictures often leaving seconds for you to figure out what she just drew on the graph. I clicker points are important in each lecture. As well as the online quizes which are nothing like the class but important. Prelims are hard, but not the worst."
5959,134422,Jennifer,Wissink,Cornell University,Economics,ECON102,1.0,5.0,Wissink is the worst professor ever. She is rude during office hours and wastes time during lecture to talk about the history of economics instead of showing how to do problems and concepts that are on her prelims. The multiple choice questions on her prelims and final are worth so many points and really kill the overall test scores.
5961,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV1817,5.0,4.0,"Taking Professor Katzenstein's class was the best decision I made at Cornell. His breadth of knowledge about the IR field is immeasurable. If you put in the work and pay attention in lecture, you'll enjoy invaluable tangents (sprinkled with some German humor) and incredible insights from a true scholar. I'm honored to have had this opportunity."
5962,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV3547,4.0,4.0,PK is by far one of the best professors I've had at Cornell. This class is plenty of work but it is by far worth it as you will learn a whole lot.
5963,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV3547,5.0,4.0,"Was so close to dropping this class in the beginning but so grateful I didn't. Best class I've taken at Cornell, taught by the best professor too. He is hilarious, wise, and supportive--even if you say something silly, he helps correct you, but not in a condescending way. Definitely requires effort, but it's truly interesting content."
5964,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,ILR3547,5.0,3.0,"You have the opportunity to study twenty-something countries' political and economic decisions, engage broad, international themes of the political economy, under one of the most renowned professors of international relations in the world."
5965,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3547,5.0,4.0,"PK's class is a must-take if you are studying government, intl. relations or policy related subjects. The most valuable thing about taking a class with renowned professor with a lot of experience is that he slips in bits and pieces of wisdom during lectures. You just can't get those with other professors, even though they may be good lecturers"
5966,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3547,5.0,4.0,"By far the best class I've taken in the GOVT major. PK is a pro. It's a little harder than most GOVT classes at Cornell, but you will learn a ton."
5967,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV354,5.0,3.0,He crafts his lectures beautifully. This was one of the best courses I have taken at Cornell. Katzenstein is truly a remarkable professor who deeply cares about his students. His passion for the subject matter is apparent and inspirational.
5968,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3547,5.0,4.0,"One of the finest professors I've learned from at Cornell. PK is an articulate, brilliant, and compassionate instructor. If you're interested in taking the most comprehensive course on modern international politics and the global economy - this is it. No exams, grade primarily based on term paper so you can sit back and enjoy the lectures."
5969,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV3547,5.0,4.0,"One of those rare courses where you are incentivized to learn for the sake of learning, not to cram for a test. Discussions were intimidating but thoughtful. PK is respected, wise, and has a great sense of humor. This class is about endurance, you need to come prepared for each lecture."
5970,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3547,5.0,4.0,"I have taken two classes offered by Professor Katzenstein while at Cornell. I found both of them to be excellent, and the lectures were highly engaging. My one comment would be that on occasion in his lower level classes it seems the lectures are a little disconnected from material outside of class, but students should still definitely attend! A+"
5971,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3547,5.0,4.0,Best class I have taken at Cornell. Prof Katzenstein is amazing!
5972,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,AEM3547,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors at Cornell. Timeless wisdom.
5973,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT2817,5.0,3.0,"If you give half a crap about what's going on in the world, take a class w PK. No exams and a lot of freedom w assignments to write about what you want, so you get from the class what you put into it, but to have him as a professor is a privilege. First time in a while I felt like I was in class to learn something important, not just for a grade."
5974,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT2817,4.0,2.0,"The class and lectures were interesting, but not completely necessary to complete the policy memos and book review, which your grade is based on. The writing assignments are also fairly straightforward and relatively easy to complete."
5975,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT2817,5.0,4.0,"This class was very interesting and is applicable to practical understandings of modern politics. PK is a very great lecturer and this class was one of the only gov classes that I have actually enjoyed at this school. The papers were intense, but overall assisted with my development as an academic scholar. :)"
5976,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV2817,5.0,4.0,This is my first class taught by PK. It is actually my first GOV class as I am not a GOV major and I only took this class out of interest. PK is a great lecturer and did a phenomenal job at creating a safe space for female students and minorities to share their thoughts in class. He is also very caring and respectful of his students.
5977,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT2817,5.0,2.0,PK is a wonderful professor. Wears the hottest turtlenecks. Inspires devotion and thought. Please take him -- you won't regret it.
5978,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT2817,5.0,3.0,"Professor Katzenstein is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and available for help. He truly wants all of his students to succeed, and everybody should take a class with him if they have the chance. Worked hard at making all students feel comfortable whether or not they agreed with his views, and was overall amazing."
5979,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT2817,5.0,4.0,"I absolutley loved professor Katzenstein PK is one of the best teachers i've ever seen and he is never biased or politically motivated in any way. I absolutley loved his classes and I highly suggest anyone who is atcornell to do the same !! Both my dad and Uncle had him as well,they all loved him"
5980,191934,Peter,Katzenstein,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT2817,5.0,4.0,"Taking a class with PK is the best way to learn about pretty much anything you within the sphere of international relations - he has open ""labs"" and you can ask him literally anything and he'll almost certainly know the answer. His lectures are informative and his assignments give you a lot flexibility. Lectures can be hard to follow sometimes."
5981,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,2.5,5.0,"Overall you learn very little in this class.  His goal is to make you use critical thinking to answer questions, but in the end his teaching style means that you don't end up learning much about biology.  His office hours are very helpful, but he tends to tear apart the people who ask questions.  The class also has a harsh curve, all tests are T/F."
5982,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,2.5,5.0,"""My thinking questions are the type of evaluations you can expect on the MCAT"". No Prof Owens, Ive taken the MCAT and can attest that memorization is far more valued than your method of TF grading which serves to primarily induce stress, confusion, and skewed expectations for premeds. Still must admit, he is very commited to teaching vital concepts"
5983,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,4.0,4.0,"Here's the deal: If you're the type of person who has gotten by so far in life by memorizing text books then this class isn't for you. Ownens asks questions that require you to have a deep understanding of the material beyond the simple facts. They are difficult, but fair. "
5984,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,1.0,5.0,Worst class I ever chose to take.  The class is more of an exercise in proving the textbook wrong than it is understanding material.  The tests were all truefalse and completely destroyed everyone grade-wise.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!
5985,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,3.0,4.0,"This dude is mad smart and I think he has difficulty conveying all of what's in his head. The prelims are tricky, but they make for really good discussion. Your study group will carry you, but you better know your material and how to manipulate it."
5986,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIO1440,3.0,5.0,"Tom Owens is better at proving the textbook wrong than conveying information to students. Easily the worst mistake I've made since coming here has been taking this class in the fall with him. TF Qs ONLY, a confusing as hell examgroup exam grading system, and a CURVED PARTICIPATION GRADE made this easily the worst class experience I have so far."
5987,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,5.0,4.0,Go to office hours - they really help!
5988,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,4.5,4.0,"Owens is a great lecturer and knows the material well, but his prelims test how much you're able to think like him, rather than how much of the material you know. The best thing about him is that he lets you re-take each test with your study group for extra credit. This is the best way to understand your mistakes in this class. "
5989,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,1440,3.0,5.0,"Yeah um this class was a disaster. If you're a hard worker, it won't really matter unless you can get around tricky test questions. Honestly this class is just a way of giving students who know the material well, and who got 4's and 5's on their AP Biology exams, bad grades. Just an awful experience. "
5990,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,3.0,5.0,"If you're looking for an intro biology class to take, I'd take one where your grade is not based on wordy truefalse confusing tests! Maybe I would take again as a sophomore, but disastrous first ""science"" course at Cornell!"
5991,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,1440,1.5,5.0,All test questions are truefalse. Extremely tricky questions and you must understand the material beyond the textbook. Seriously need to understand how he words the questions on the exams to do well in the class. Majority of your grade is based on test grades.
5992,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,3.0,3.0,"Good guy, very smart and cares a lot about the material. Lecture are helpful but personally I wouldn't go to them if he didn't take attendance through those mini (ungraded) quizzes. Tests are east once you get the hang of them, but it may take one or two prelims to do so. The best way to study is not to just memorize but to understand the material."
5993,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,5.0,3.0,He is an amazing professor who is always there for his students. He truly cares and his office hours are extremely helpful. People who dislike him just don't utilize all the help he offers. He says it himself this is not a memorization course
5994,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,2.5,5.0,You think you substantially know the material but it doesn't really help when you're taking a prelim. The truefalse tests are incredibly difficult and make you feel bad about yourself. Attend Owen's office hours if you want to receive a satisfactory grade. Take this in the Spring!
5995,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,2.0,5.0,"This class is/isn't worth studying for. Read the text, participated in study group, + attended some office hours, still got killed by T/F exams. :( Take this in the spring, or take a BIOEE instead!!!"
5996,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,2.0,5.0,"You have to think like him to do well in the class. It's probably better to take it as a sophomore (after you take cell biology BIOMG 1350 as a freshman). His exams are pretty confusing and might not measure how much you studied. If you want to stick with the class, go to his office hours!!! This is the ticket to not failing!"
5997,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,4.0,3.0,Very smart person and expects you to be just as smart. his t/f exams are tricky and requires you to know the txtbk material VERY well and then APPLY them to the situation. go to office hours and listen even if you dont have questions. go to lectures and take notes on what he says. He is pretty condescending when explaining an answer to a question..
5998,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,3.5,4.0,"The exams are super hard. The trick to the class is attending his office hours. According a vast majority of the students I know, that's where he bases his Prelim questions on."
5999,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1440,1.0,5.0,"So vague, when asking questions he gives vague answers/""big picture"" yet some of his test questions are so specific. Try to take this class in the Spring!"
6000,18310,Thomas,Owens,Cornell University,Science,BIO1440,1.5,5.0,"I put so much effort into this class, but still got killed by the course. True/false exams were really tricky."
6002,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2510,5.0,5.0,"Really recommend that you take this along CHEM3580, or after CHEM3580 if you can. He's always behind in lectures. Study the prelab very well and make sure to complete each objective to get the lab notebook points in the end. This course will take so much of your time so if you can take it in the summer I highly advise you to do just that."
6003,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,3.0,4.0,"Your grade is determined solely by the 3 prelims and the final (no hw grade). Make sure you go to lectures because sometimes he'll throw in reactions he talks about in lecture but isn't talked about in the textbook. He can explain things decently well but like others have said, he wastes a lot of time in lecture telling personal stories."
6004,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,3.0,4.0,"This had be one of the most challenging courses that I have taken at Cornell. Be prepared to work for your grade every day because if you don't, you'll fall behind. You have to do 2-3 hours of orgo every da, whether that be reviewing your notes and doing practice questions. The textbook was helpful in some cases with explaining topics after learned"
6005,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,2.0,5.0,"This class is incredibly difficult, and this is coming from someone who managed to do well in all other pre-med requirements. Be prepared to WORK. This professor doesn't make the class any easier or enjoyable."
6006,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,2.0,5.0,"The increase in difficulty from 3570 to 3580 is unreasonably dramatic. You have to study at least 2-3 hours of organic chemistry every single day and attend every problem solving session to be successful. You cannot afford to fall behind a single bit. Don't listen to other comments saying this class is doable, prepare to work 1000% to have a chance"
6007,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,3.0,3.0,"He is an extremely intelligent professor and obviously knows what he is talking about, but often lacks sympathy for his students. He spends a lot of time telling stories instead of teaching and then rushes through what he was supposed to cover. Despite this, I did think it was a really cool class. Work as many problems and exams as you can."
6008,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,1.0,4.0,"This is not a class you take with other rigorous STEM courses. He is too fast, easily distracted, and hard to follow. He can explain things decently, but drawing is essential to this class and his notes are always messy. Do the practice exams and go to problem solving sessions/OH. If you cannot attend, kiss your grade goodbye. Hated this class."
6009,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,4.0,"Go to lecture! The textbook is useless: frequently has mechanisms contradictory to Tom's, and Tom gives way more than enough practice. So go to every lecture and pay attention and write down even stuff that isn't on the board! He explains mechanisms a lot verbally and those explanations may help you understand the material. Do practice problems!!"
6010,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2510,3.0,4.0,"For 2 credits, 2510 is a lot of work (10 hr/wk), but that means it affects your GPA less. Spends too much time on his life stories. Take 3580 concurrently or before, or the final is impossible. If you can't take 3580, then go to lecture and office hrs (both TA and Tom)! Don't freak about the practical, but prepare. Study a LOT for the final exam."
6011,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,2.0,5.0,"Professor Ruttledge believes that the Chemistry department has worked hard for students' success. While this might be true in many aspects, he storms toward the opposite direction. For example, he shows little sympathy and respect, such as humiliating a student who scored a ""true zero"" (actually attempting to take the test and scoring a zero)."
6012,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,1.0,5.0,Easily the worst professor at Cornell. Super arrogant and does not care about students. Begins each lecture by bragging about how great he is. Creates tests that he knows students will do poorly on and is energized by seeing students struggling.
6013,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM1150,5.0,1.0,"Loved this professor's class. Really funny, interesting material, and an extremely generous grading curve- it is literally impossible to fail this class. You do need to come to class, since all prelim material is covered in class and there is no textbook. Would recommend for anyone."
6014,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,1.0,5.0,What people say about his lectures are true. I came here to warn you-- don't bother with the textbook. His mechanisms contradict with the textbook's (and every other online source for that matter) and he docks points for drawing alternative (but correct) mechanisms. He basically lives in his own world of chemistry. Good luck with this class.
6015,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM1150,5.0,3.0,"Go to Class! All tests are based entirely on the lecture notes &amp; the class grade entirely off of 2 prelims &amp; a final. Overall I just showed up to class, PAID ATTENTION, studied maybe 1-2hr for each prelim, &amp; got an A- w curve. Professor Ruttledge is super passionate &amp; really really nice. Does his best to make the material less dense. Fav prof. LOVE"
6016,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2510,1.0,5.0,PRAY TO GOD NOT TO GET THIS PROFESSOR EVER AGAIN!!!!
6017,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2510,1.0,4.0,"Makes a 2 credit intro organic chemistry lab course way more work than it needs to be. Felt like lectures were always behind schedule and that there was a huge discontinuity between what was going on during the lab sections and what was going on in class. I don't care what you did in Ghana or Paris, I care about learning the material."
6018,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM0000,5.0,4.0,Omg i love this professor!!! I wish more professors had his intense personality. For some reason the way he teaches boosted my confidence a lot. He makes things so clear and straightforward and I don't feel dumb. Not at all arrogant. I felt alive and happy in his class. Better experience with him than the other chemistry professors.
6019,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2510,2.0,5.0,"I did not enjoy this class at all. If you're not a solid chem student, Professor Rutledge will make you feel like an idiot. He is very arrogant. I personally did not like his teaching style at all. He can be funny, but he is full of himself. I do not recommend at all."
6020,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580AND2510,5.0,5.0,"On the first lecture, Tom will have a pep talk on how to do well in the class, office hours. A good amount of people show up to his first few but only a handful end up going regularly. Be one of those few that go consistently, it's a great way to stay on top of the material, and he is the nicest most sincere person who will make sure you learn orgo"
6021,16475,Thomas,Ruttledge,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,4.0,4.0,"I had Tom for CHEM 2510 and CHEM 3580 in the same semester. He teaches the material very clearly, but sometimes digresses to tell you about his latest trip to Paris or tell you a joke about his mom. However, I think he does that to keep your attention. He will test you on conceptual knowledge and not memorization. Overall, he was a great professor."
6023,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.0,3.0,"If you're good at math take Maria Terrell, if not find another professor."
6024,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH112,1.0,1.0,"WORST professor I had for Math, ever! Highly opinionated and does not listen."
6025,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,3.0,4.0,She was very enthusiastic about the material.  The material was pretty hard but the tests were straightforward.
6026,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,3.0,5.0,"She's a genius, but VERY disorganized prof. She had us use her unfinished textbook for Multi. That meant it was free, but also devoid of examples and not very helpful. Lectures were also disorganized, and discussions didn't help much. I passed the class thanks to her easy grading, but didn't learn the material. She's nice but I don't recommend."
6027,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,4.5,4.0,"Don't judge her according to the scores on this site. Professor Terrell is one of the best professors I've ever met at Cornell. She teaches me not only knowledge but also ways to think and how math is related to science. Prelims and finals are OK if you review all homework problems. Yes, she does seem a little weird, but it makes her lecture fun."
6028,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,4.5,4.0,"She was friendly, helpful, and always willing to give time to explain something. Tests were difficult, but fair. She inspired me to become a math major, and her lectures were incredible."
6029,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Terrell was one of the best profs I've had here so far. She was extremely committed to making sure you understood the material. Office hours were an incredible resource. You can tell she really cares about her students. She was trying out the textbook she was writing, so we got free printouts."
6030,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,4.0,3.0,"She was trying out a new book that she was writing, which was still a bit rough in some spots. She had a way of making complicated ideas more approachable and had a somewhat eccentric sense of humor."
6031,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.5,5.0,Both my roommate and I had Maria for Math 1920. The vast majority of lectures are spent on theories that aren't that relevant to the core elements of the course. I would say that only 5% of the lecture topics actually appeared on tests and there is a terrible curve.
6032,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH111,1.0,5.0,"Professor Terrell was not helpful to me. One time in office hours, she made me wait 20 minutes so that she could finish writing a review about herself on this site. In the end, I passed the class thanks to the Calc I tutoring sessions done by another professor."
6033,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.0,5.0,Ineffective lecturer. She struggles to make sense and gets on too many irrelevant tangents. Sometimes she goes over time without any consideration for those of us who have to get to another class.
6034,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Terrell is the best math professor I've had so far at Cornell. She really wants her students to understand the subject and puts a lot of effort into making the concepts more intuitive. She does a lot of examples in lecture that follow clearly to the homework. It's still the Cornell math department though, so tests are hard."
6035,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.0,4.0,Awful lectures. Maria seems to be more committed to writing fake reviews on this board than to improve her teaching skills. Catch her offguard in office hours and you will see. Tests are somewhat fair. The worst part is the textbook which doesn't provide good examples.
6036,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,2.0,"This professor made learning multivariable calculus fun, stress free, and manageable. Her personality animated the lectures and she was a VERY good explainer. Great class. No complaints."
6037,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,3.0,Really eccentric but one of the best lecturers I've had at Cornell. She really makes an effort to explain the math concepts instead of just writing down equations or doing constant proofs and theorems like 1910. Exams were okay except the final which was killer. She's not perfect but as far as 1920 is concerned she's fantastic at teaching it all.
6038,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.0,2.0,"Some complain that the tests are hard but that is not the case at all. I've compared her tests to those set by other professors who've taught the class. Her questions were easy and a straightforward application of the concepts, whereas other professors' required many layers of depth and demanded thorough understanding. Just pay attention in class."
6039,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,3.0,"Probably my favorite lecturer thus far. The material is hard but she does a great job coming up with simplified versions that are easy to understand. She is quite entertaining as well. I didn't always take notes in class because, being honest, sometimes I barely made it to 11 am class on Friday but just sitting in class was enough to learn a lot."
6040,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.0,3.0,Terrell is very quirky but that makes lectures more interesting than they otherwise would be. Emphasizes geometry and thinking about a problem rather than following the same steps for each one. Prelims are reasonable and corrections are very helpful.
6041,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,3.0,"I really enjoyed 1920 with Terrell. Her lectures are clear and organized. She make s the class enjoyable with her quirky examples, and she adds some jokes here and there. If you put in some effort  you'll end up with a good grade! "
6042,503069,Maria,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,4.0,An amazing professor who truly cares about how well her students learn the material and how they do in the class.
6044,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"Super inspirational professor who clearly loves CS! Although the assignments took a long time, they were completely based on material learned in lecture (as are the exams.) She was great about using a wide variety of creative examples to explain thing."
6045,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,2.0,Literally the best prof I've had at Cornell. Very clear and logical lectures.
6046,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,Really loved her lectures. Clear and logical.
6047,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,2.0,"Prof Fan's been teaching the course every semester for a number of years, and it shows. As someone who had never coded before this class, I was able to do very well by studying the lecture slides. The 6 projects take a long time, but they also helped me with the material a TON. There was no curve, so be sure to not make careless errors on exams."
6048,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,3.0,3.0,"Lectures were pretty good but get ready to spend hours on the projects. Projects are definitely do-able, just time-consuming. Be wary."
6049,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,5.0,"I had minimal cs experience going into this class but Daisy WILL teach you how to code by the time you come out. She is easily one of the kindest, most compassionate and caring professors who will do everything she can to help you succeed. The projects can be overwhelming and terrifying but if you do them the tests are VERY fair and manageable."
6050,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,4.0,2.0,"A great lecturer who really helps give comprehensive insight on the material. This was my first ever computer science course, and while the material was difficult at times, it was a rewarding experience to go through. She provides the textbook online for free and keeps lectures interactive with clicker questions as well."
6051,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,4.0,5.0,"While she is one of more empathetic and caring professors on this campus, the course itself gave me a lot of anxiety. It never felt like a intro class to me because too many people who had coding experience and they were are the only ones getting high grades. The class was hard and deflated as 92 was a B+. If you value your grade take python."
6052,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1132,5.0,3.0,I really love her class. The lecture is delivered super clear in a detailed way. She's very humorous and the class is very attractive. I really learned a lot during the class. Though the assignment can be quite challenging sometimes.
6053,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,3.0,"Clear lecturer and very open to helping students outside of class. The course is a very standard intro programming course, doesn't really teach specific features of MATLAB. I learned the most from projects, but lectures were also helpful. Additional resources like the recommended reading and discussions were slightly less important to me."
6054,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,3.0,"Such a passionate and energetic woman. Absolutely love her. Her lectures are clear and organized, and she is very approachable outside of class."
6055,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,2.0,"She's a nice lady. The projects can get lengthy towards the end. The tests weren't too hard, but they would take off for the most insignificant things. Make sure to look over their rating on prelims, they messed up on both of mine and I got some points back."
6056,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,3.0,5.0,"Intro CS classes can be tough because some people know how to code, others don't. Some people can pick it up easily, others don't. While I found her lectures interesting, the assignments I found impossible because the lectures were not directly related to the assignments. I spent 20-25 hours every other week in office hours in order to complete hw."
6057,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,4.0,I took this class with absolutely no coding experience and it was extremely hard in the beginning. This class is an absurd mix of students with no experience and students who've been coding for years. It takes some time and lots of practice (give urself time for the projects!!!!) but Daisy really will teach u how to code and succeed if u stick w it
6058,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,4.0,3.0,"You have to go to class because she does clicker questions. Also, the code discussed in class is very likely to show up on the prelims. Sometimes her pacing is a little wonky (both too fast and too slow), but the discussion sections help you get over that lapse. Overall, she's a pretty fun professor and I would take her again."
6059,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,4.0,3.0,"The projects will be the best way to learn the material, and sometimes she speaks softly."
6060,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,4.0,3.0,"I really appreciated Daisy's effort she put in to her lectures. It definitely felt like she knew what she was talking about and tried to convey the relevant stuff. She was also incredibly helpful in office hours, and I couldn't have done the projects without her help."
6061,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,4.0,"I came into this class with no prior CS experience which made it very challenging. Considering that Daisy has to lecture to such as wide range of skill, she does a pretty good job. I learned a lot in this class, but definitely focus more on studying for exams considering they are worth nearly 3/4 of your course grade."
6062,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,4.0,Great class.  She is an amazing teacher who takes the time to walk thoroughly through even the simplest of concepts (if you're paying attention.)  I came into the class with no CS background and now am considering CS as my major.  Be prepared to work your ass off when the projects come around!
6063,202231,Daisy,Fan,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1112,5.0,3.0,"She is a great lecturer!  The projects were difficult and took insane amounts of time, but the exams were never as bad as the projects"
6065,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,4.0,5.0,Chem 2080 was harder than chem 2070 for me but I got a better grade. Dr. Hines is a very good lecturer and she gets straight to the point. She isn't as caring as Dr. Lee but she makes an effort to provide for her students. Group quizzes are extremely hard if you end up in a bad group. Prelims are difficult as well. Good luck!
6066,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,4.0,Does not care about students at all and I have seen that over the years the same problem arises where students get grades far lower than they expected because she needs her curve to look a certain way. Handles the online conversion terribly and class actually got more difficult. There was clear evidence of cheating on the final impacting the curve
6067,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,4.0,By far the worst professor I've had at Cornell. Poor lecturer and actively looks for ways to decrease her student's grades
6068,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,5.0,"Take it with a different professor if possible, she wasnt very helpful before or after going online."
6069,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,5.0,Professor Hines' lectures covered the basics well but were never enough to solve problem sets or group quizzes alone. Tests were quite difficult. There was little accommodation post-covid. Her grading scheme makes it very difficult to know what grade you will get in the class because everything is graded how well you do relative to the mean
6070,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,2.0,5.0,"Good lecturer. Tests weren't super hard, but the labs and group quizzes were quite tough before the pandemic. Online exams were not well planned and inequitable for a ton of students. The material really isn't that difficult... but the grading is harsh."
6071,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,5.0,"While Hines is a good lecturer and her tests are fair, the class itself is very hard to get a good grade in. However, this is typical for a gen chem course. The reason for such a low rating is because after the class switched online due to COVID-19, there was NO compassion for students and no action was taken to help students succeed AT ALL"
6072,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,5.0,Awful. Cold. She was terrible before the pandemic - but since then we really see who she is. Not a nice person. Uncaring. Ridiculously hard grader. AVOID.
6073,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,4.0,Ever since corona the class has become impractical online for many students including myself.
6074,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,2.0,4.0,"test were pretty straight forward and similar to past prelims. there are weekly group quizzes, so its not good if you have a bad group. not accommodating at all during the switch to online class, made work load even more. lectures were not recorded when in class. if you can do group quiz questions and past prelims, you will be fine on tests."
6075,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,4.0,Prof. is not very good at explaining concepts and became harsher when things went online from this pandemic.
6076,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,5.0,I dont even know where to begin with this professor. She showed absolutely NO empathy to her students during this pandemic and did not change her expectations at all. Student did not have access to the same resources and environment and still he expected the same. Obvious that she cares about her board of trustee status more than her students.
6077,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,2.0,5.0,I got a B in CHEM 2070 so I was expecting 2080 to be about the same level of difficulty. WRONG! If you can take this course equivalent at another school I highly recommend doing it. Taking it at Cornell isn't worth the stress and anxiety.
6078,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,2.0,5.0,"During the pandemic she has not eased up on us at all. I guess she does not seem to care that we have personal problems during this time. Before the pandemic, she was kinda okay. Her lectures are organized, but doesn't explain things too well (she just expects us to know background info). She also doesnt give a lot practice problems for tests."
6079,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,5.0,During a whole pandemic this professor did not even try to alter the class to benefit the students. Terrible.
6080,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,4.0,4.0,"Hines is handling corona very well, and it shows me how much she cares and puts into the course. You can tell she has been doing it for years, is a chemist at heart, and also infuses her sense of humor/ personality into a lot of the lab/ group quiz readings, which I appreciate. Definetly not easy and you could get screwed with group quiz group tho"
6081,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,2.0,"Honestly dont know what goes on in P Hines head. She gives us grade ranges after each test, but out final grade does not reflect those ranges at all. I emailed her and the chemistry office but received no reply back..."
6082,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,4.0,"Prof Hines tests were okay and seemed to be curved pretty generously. The group quizzes, although pretty ridiculous, were graded leniently by the TAs who knew that we learned nothing in lecture. But grades came out lower than expected, and we are left with no explanation of how our grades were calculated and no email responses to questions"
6083,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,4.0,"Not a bad lecturer but I disliked the class. In multiple instances, she hasn't taught us a topic yet but expects to understand how to solve it in the group quizzes, and then proceeds to teach the material the day the group quiz is due. She also gave practice exams without formula sheets where you literally could not solve without the given data."
6084,139568,Melissa,Hines,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2080,1.0,4.0,She is not a very clear lecturer. She gives you one example of the entire topic that she is teaching and teaches it one way. She gives no opportunity for improvement. I learned nothing in that class. Kyle was so much better
6086,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,3.0,3.0,"Curtis is not a very pleasant guy and is very particular, but he puts a lot of effort into preparing his material and teaching finance. He says attendance is mandatory but it clearly is not. Whole grade based on 4 tests. His tests aren't easy, but seemed to become a lot easier once class went online. At least there's never any work besides studying"
6087,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2240,2.0,4.0,"I took his class in 2012 and honestly, he made me pay attention and learn a lot. But... wow, what an unnecessarily unpleasant man. I've had plenty of other teachers that did not need to resort to oppressive tactics to make their students learn effectively."
6088,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,4.0,TAKE HOTELIE FINANCE
6089,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,1.0,Stay far away from this class if youre interested in learning anything useful about finance.
6090,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,3.0,BAD CLASS BAD PROF
6091,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,5.0,"I learned everything from his 600 page ""supplemental"" course packet and that forsakenly dry textbook, but his pride will ensure you get no higher than a B- if you skip lecture bc of 5-6 questions on his exam that you could only have gotten if you epoxied your eyelids open during his vegetative-state inducing lectures."
6092,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,5.0,5.0,"Class is tough, but you can learn a lot from it. Professor has strict rules, but if you talk to him, his personality is very very nice! If you want to learn well in Finance, recommend this class. But if you're doing it just for fun or interest, consider the one in hotel school. Overall, I like this class very much. Almost cry in the last class lol"
6093,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,5.0,"He is literally the worst professor I have had in four years. He doesn't know how to lecture and purely emphasizes memorization of all concepts. He picks random and unrelated topics from the textbook and tests you on it. His teaching style is incompatible with any student's learning. Take hotelie finance, it is significantly easier. ABORT"
6094,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,2.0,This class was maddeningly tedious
6095,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,5.0,4.0,"Put in the work and you will do well. Curtis is a great professor when you get to know him and his teaching style. If youre willing to work hard and seek out help if youre struggling, Curtis will help you succeed; no other professor holds extra office hours late into the night (around midnight) the week before the exam. Highly recommend"
6096,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,5.0,This course taught me that there is more to life than high finance.
6097,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,1.0,"Terrible class, Curtis emphasizes memorization over concepts..."
6098,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,1.0,Professor Curtis is the only professor who refuses to take student questions during lectures. Let that sink in.
6099,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,3.0,Strict professor and very disorganized lectures
6100,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,2.0,"This class was an absolute waste of time. Disorganized lectures, little guidance, and a moody professor. Take the finance course offered by the hotel school."
6101,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,4.0,"If you think the 40-paged syllabus is excessive, you're going to think this entire course is excessive."
6102,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,2.0,Do not take this class if you have any interest in learning about finance.
6103,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,3.0,"Go to his review lectures, they will save you hours of cumbersome lectures throughout the semester. But if you really want to save some valuable time, take a different finance class."
6104,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,3.0,"His lectures are some of the most sleep inducing ordeals I have had to deal with at Cornell and he makes it worse by shaming you if you're not attentive. Considering that I only have this issue with this class, I wonder whose fault this really is."
6105,183398,Richard,Curtis,Cornell University,Business,AEM2241,1.0,2.0,He knows magic tricks. His most famous trip is making the class fall asleep.
6107,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,3.0,1.0,"If you want a good grade for this class, try to get on your TA's good side instead of the professor. Go to as many office hours (especially your TA's) for the case studies as possible and you are sure to get something in the A range. The class is very easy if you come in with some background knowledge in finance."
6108,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,1.0,5.0,"Heavy workload. And I just don't understand the optional final policy. You got your expected grade four days prior to the exam, and you have to make an instant decision whether to take the exam or not (and study for it). It just adds too much burden to students. Plus it is extremely unfair for students who already have travel plans."
6109,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,1.0,4.0,He should go teaching electrical engineering since he can't stop talking about it. This class made my worst cornell experience so far. Didn't really learn anything from those time-consuming cases and superficial lectures which he tried to make them seem deep.
6110,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,1.0,3.0,"Terrible, really terrible. Basically you learn nothing. And he TAKES ATTENDANCE, 2 points, 1 for attendance and another for paying attention. Your grade on this class, to a great extent, depends on what kinda TA you are assigned to. So basically, your luck counts a lot if you want to get a good grade."
6111,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher. We had to write a lot, but you get used to it."
6112,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,5.0,5.0,"If you are not a hard worker, you will not perform well in the course. There are a ton of cases, and they actually are pretty intellectually challenging. Perez himself is incredibly smart, but you really have to attentively listen to him to understand the depth of his lectures. I highly recommend participating as much as you can in this course."
6113,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,3.0,4.0,"The weekly cases (sometimes 2 or 3 a week) can make the class seem so long. Study the previous lecture for the quizzes. Lecture heavy. The final group presentation project isnt bad, just have to have an understanding of the case. Not a bad class overall, can be on your laptop."
6114,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,1.0,5.0,"At the end of the semester, he even refused to tell you your overall score, such as participation grade. Even though he taught nothing in class, he is a very tough grader, and cares nothing about the students' feeling. This is the worst experience that I have ever had in Cornell. Cornell really should find another prof."
6115,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM120,2.0,4.0,"Professor Perez radiates passion and vigour. He inspires his students to think analytically about business cases. He entertains as well as teaches, and often jumps vigorously on and off tables in a melodramatic fashion. One learns a lot from his classes. A great professor but one who may not always give his undivided attention to his students."
6116,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,3.0,2.0,"Prof. Perez enjoys what he lectures and tries to make seemingly-superficial material relevant. The course was somewhat disorganized, but Perez was very accommodating. As long as you do all the work, the class should be fine."
6117,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,HADM3080,5.0,2.0,Took this class on a Friday afternoon for about 2 hours. Fantastic discussions regarding ethics and a bit of philosophy with interesting cases. Graded on reflections which are fairly short.
6118,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,2.0,3.0,"The majority of my work that semester was from his class (case studies and 2 large projects). The quizzes were literally impossible, and reading the chapters they were supposedly based on didn't help. However I  managed to get an A in the class so looking back I'm okay with it. Take advantage of all extra credit and try to participate in class."
6119,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,4.0,2.0,"You do not really learn that much in lecture, and the quizzes in class can be tough, but overall everyone does well and it is a great first business class at the Dyson School."
6120,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,2.0,3.0,"One legit question on a quiz he gave us is ""Is quality expensive?"" (Answer was somehow 'false') Studying for the many tests is almost useless since he will ask the most arbitrary irrelevant questions just to make sure no one gets 100. He's pretty passionate/animated about his subject, but it gets in the way of letting the lectures be clear."
6121,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,1.0,4.0,Smart guy but very unclear in what he expects for assignments.
6122,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1230,2.0,2.0,"Overall a fine class, but the information presented is utterly irrelevant. My biggest and probably only problem with this class is that he doesn't tell you what he wants and relies too much on the TA's who don't really help at all. But bottom line, as long as you show up you're pretty much guaranteed a B."
6123,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,2.5,2.0,"Pedro's class is not very straightforward in terms of his expectations or material that is covered. That being said, I did poorly on my prelims, but still ended up with a good grade because I went to class and got all of the extra credit opportunities. Not a great class experience while you're in it but you will be surprised with your grade"
6124,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,1.5,3.0,"Pedro is a a below average professor. His lectures are incoherent, and the class provides you with such minimal information about different areas of business that I left each class without having learned much. His teaching assistants grade unfairly at times and are not the nicest people. I was not impressed or happy with this class or professor."
6125,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM1200,1.0,1.0,easy A+ as it is
6126,195472,Pedro,Perez,Cornell University,Business,AEM2200,2.0,3.0,"Get an easier TA! Quizzes are often a surprise, mostly based off of power points, that at times doesn't make complete sense. Participation is needed but pointless as the same idiotic loud students take over the discussions."
6127,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,5.0,1.0,Awesome lecturer. He actually made gen chem fun which I thought was impossible. Great guy!
6128,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,4.0,4.0,Good overall
6129,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM608,5.0,4.0,"paul is an amazing professor.  his lectures were like chapters - each one with key developments and players.  his exams were difficult, but fair, and he was very willing to assist on hw granted you attend office hours.  he's friendly and funny and an organized, clear and effective lecturer.  he can be patient - but he expects a high level of effort"
6130,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM102,5.0,4.0,"Chem was always a problem for me, until I heard about this great prof, Paul Chirik.  He made some of the most difficult areas very easy to understand.  Great instructor."
6131,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,2.0,1.0,"A couple years out, I now realize he is just an entertainer, not an scholar. Hopefully he matures into a real educator some day."
6132,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM207,3.5,4.0,"He is hot and a great teacher. Sure his tests are hard, but he makes you think and grades fairly at the end."
6133,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Very clear and very funny. I loved going to class cuz Chirik was interactive and friendly and the material was interesting. One of the best lecturers I have seen. If you want to learn chemistry (thermo, kinetics, etc.) start with chem 215, esp with Chirik."
6134,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM207,4.0,5.0,"Definitely the best professor I've ever had.  I never wanted to miss a class because they were so fun.  The exams and problem sets are hard though, but he makes the class totally worth it! Also the class is ""chemistry according to Paul Chirik"" so you don't have to read the book!"
6135,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM207,3.5,4.0,"Chirik's lectures are a blast... literally. However, the quality of the lesson could be better. Hes absolutely adorable and really funny though. Everyone loves him."
6136,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM207,4.0,2.0,"Good professor.  Very funny.  His tests were okay, learned a lot in this class."
6137,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,4.0,4.0,"Great professor, amazing lecturer, and great class.  He really made me interested in chemistry.  Tests are very difficult, but fair in general.  He seemed to become more patient with answering questions towards the end of the semester."
6138,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,3.5,4.0,"Chirik has a great passion for chemistry and relates what he's teaching to reality.  His tests are very difficult, but they push a student to do their best and then get better.  Chirik expects students to work hard and think and act like scientists."
6139,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,4.0,4.0,"A funny teacher, but sometimes takes time from class telling jokes and goes off topic. The demonstrations are always fun and his sense of humor keeps students awake in the morning. The labs for the class are hard and the tests are even harder, but the curve is generous. However, intense studying is required and the problem sets are sometimes hard."
6140,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,2.5,4.0,"Great personality - cracks a lot of jokes and keeps class interesting, resorting to his humor and many usually awesome demos.  Does a decent job teaching the material, though it isn't always clear.  TA &amp; office hours help alot.  Workload is reasonable, but prelims are rather difficult.  It's a good class."
6141,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,4.0,4.0,"Problem sets can be daunting, TA office hours are incredibly helpful. Problem sets are often not as hard as they appear, sometimes just weirdly worded. Funny guy during class, keeps it interesting. Sometimes doesn't give examples which makes it hard to know how to apply some information, but generally a good professor."
6142,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,2.0,5.0,"Problem sets were confusing, exams even more so. Lectures mostly consist of him deriving formulas on the board. This class convinced me not to major in chemistry."
6143,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM215,2.5,4.0,Umm... I enjoyed the lectures while i was still in this class. They were really fun and interesting. His prelim was seriously ridiculously hard and because of it I dropped to 207 in the middle of the semester. He doesn't exactly teach for a test so even if  you think you understand the information you still could have a problem on the prelim.
6144,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM207,4.0,3.0,This guy is the best freshman prof I have had.
6145,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM207,5.0,4.0,"awesome personality. really makes the lectures informative, scientific but every understandable for the student. take notes. go to lecture. go to office hours once in awhile, especially before prelims/final."
6146,272265,Paul,Chirik,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM207,2.5,4.0,"Chem isn't gonna be easy unless you're already good at it. Chirik is really funny and is a good lecturer but dont let his charming personality fool you, the class is still difficult. Go to every lecture and take good notes."
6148,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,3.0,"Attendance isn't exactly mandatory but I found going to lecture helpful. Class was medium difficulty for me because while assignments are easy, I consistently perform below the mean on exams (final is now mandatory btw). Gries is easy to understand and extremely charming and funny in an old man way. Piazza will become the God you worship."
6149,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,4.0,David Gries was one of the most understanding professors during the pandemic. I recommend all people take 2110. He and Clarkson make the class engaging and interesting. Grading is fair and not on a normal type of curve. Gries is a legend for a reason.
6150,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,3.0,u should take this class
6151,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,1.0,4.0,"Very cool professor but even after teaching this class for a substantial portion of his life still organizes it horribly. Grading is a nightmare with large sums of points being given, taken, and returned without rhyme or reason. Important things seem to be decided on a whim. Held my breath getting back assignments I knew for a fact I did correctly."
6152,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,4.0,3.0,"Assignments were less time-consuming compared to those of CS 1110, but still took me a lot of time. Lecture slides and the lecturers (Gries and Clarkson) were pretty solid, and office hours were less crowded than CS 1110's. However, Gries was pretty condescending toward students on Piazza."
6153,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,1.0,3.0,"A rude, arrogant, disrespectful professor. Its time for someone else to take over this course."
6154,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,4.0,3.0,"Gries is a very experienced professor, with a strong reputation throughout Cornell CS. He provides many resources to succeed in his class: good powerpoints, practice tests, handouts, piazza answers, and TA lectures make this class very manageable with some effort. The prelims aren't too hard if you use the practice exams, and the final is optional."
6155,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Gries is an amazing professor! He explains the material well in lecture, and it's neat to see his personal touch on programming topics, including a surprising amount of history. Let him know if you are struggling: he is kind, willing to help, and cares about students as people. Go to lecture."
6156,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,4.0,4.0,Gries is a solid professor. I learned an immense amount about OO-programming and data structures from the course. Prelims and the final project account for most of your grade in the course (particularly prelim 2). Very helpful in office hours. He is very knowledgable and has worked with some of the world's best computer scientists.
6157,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,3.0,3.0,"Sometimes confusing and can be rude when you try to ask questions on Piazza. He gets the information through, but lectures are not terribly interesting and he is very particular about certain things."
6158,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,1.0,3.0,"Boring lectures, useless ppt decks, not sure what he is doing on class."
6159,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor with great lectures. He tells you exactly what you need to know more clearly and concisely than any other professor I've had. Some things can be unclear if you learn them on your own so try to pay attention and follow along in lecture if you can.
6160,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,4.0,3.0,"Snippy when it comes to answering questions (online), but his answers try to encourage independent student learning; don't expect a polite answer if you ask about something that you can google/check the course materials for yourself."
6161,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,3.0,Very approachable outside of class. Not a hard course if you've taken CS 1110
6162,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,3.0,3.0,"He knows what he's doing. Your grade is basically based on the two prelims but you also have to do well on the assignments. The final is optional, and if you don't take it you just get the grade you have thus far, which is nice."
6163,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed the class. I know a lot of students skip lectures, but I found his lectures to be very useful and representative of the knowledge needed for the prelims. If you do well on the first two prelims, Gries lets you skip the final and take your grade as it is."
6164,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,1.0,4.0,"terrible professor, rapid unhelpful lectures, very arrogant and rude. projects hurt you but they cant help, only grades that matter are the two prelims and if u do poorly on one that's probably the grade u wil get"
6165,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,2.0,"Gries is incredibly caring and genuinely interested in helping his students. He can be quite sassy on Piazza, which can annoy some students, but I personally thought it was hilarious and gave him personality. Regardless, he is an engaging and humorous lecturer and is very willing to help you if you ask for it."
6166,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,4.0,"Gries is the most caring professor I have seen in Cornell. He makes lots of efforts to help students learn from this lecture. Some of assignments and prelims are challenging though, he and George respond to the questions on piazza efficiently. Go to his OH! It's super helpful, and you will find how patient he is going to teach you."
6167,261710,David,Gries,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gries is one of the most caring professors. His lecture slides are well-written, and he provides student opportunities to have lunch with him. The workload is fairly light and the prelims are reasonable. His lectures are pretty good and he answers almost every piazza question super fast."
6169,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,4.0,4.0,Ganem is one of the best professors I've had at Cornell; he is a really good lecturer and super engaging. I've been to his office hours and he is very patient and helpful. His prelims become progressively tougher but he is not the type of teacher to ask trick questions. I really enjoyed learning orgo because of him!
6170,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,3.0,4.0,"Okay, so Professor Ganem is like everyone says a great lecturer. He is honestly an interesting guy and tries hard in my opinion to please people, but personally, I found him to be very condescending. During office hours and problem solving sessions, he makes you seem dumb if you don't know something. Beware of some prelims and the final ..."
6171,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,4.0,Great lecturer!
6172,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,3.0,"Interesting material, great delivery in lecture, tons of help from many sources out of class (himself, TAs, CHEM 1057, tutors). Make sure you do as many problems as you can get your hands on, both from the text and from the old prelims that he gives you to study from."
6173,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,4.0,3.0,He's definitely a nice guy and tries to learn people's names. His tests are also very fair- he doesn't test you on what he doesn't teach. His lectures are also very straightforward and keeps you paying attention. Only downside is that he's not that clear when answering questions... more of the watch you until you figure it out type.
6174,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,4.0,"Ganem is easily one of the best professors I've had at Cornell. He's caring, accommodating towards the demands of college, and an incredible lecturer. His lectures are easy to follow, clear, and organized. Study his lecture notes religiously and keep up with the material and you will do fine on his exams, they're fair and mostly straight-forward."
6175,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,4.0,Prof Ganem is very clear lecturer and genuinely cares about his students. Orgo is hard because of how it's graded but the subject matter itself is not very difficult and there were no surprises on prelims. Questions are very much taken from concepts learned in lecture so go and pay attention-- he doesn't upload notes online-- and you'll be fine.
6176,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,4.0,"Definitely attend lectures and do practice and assigned sapling, and you will do well. I always enjoyed his lectures (but less so towards the end of the semester with IR and NMR topics). CHEMM 1570 with Jane Walcott was also very helpful"
6177,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,4.0,5.0,"I struggled in chem2070/80. I was very worried about taking orgo due to everything that I had heard. Prof Ganem is THE man! Even though the material is HARD, his lectures are SO clear and he really wants you to succeed and understand WHY things are happening. If you stay up on your readings and go to lecture, you will be good! Exams are very fair."
6178,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,1.0,5.0,Ganem is the worst professor I have had at Cornell. He is a rude and arrogant professor who only favors a select few. Very unfair and poor lecturer.
6179,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,4.0,5.0,"Bruce Ganem is a brilliant man who is enthusiastic about Orgo. I can appreciate him as a professor, but I truly hated this course. It's incredibly difficult and the pace is super quick. There is a very competitive nature in this class and once you stop understanding something, you get left behind."
6180,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ganem is, simply put, the best professor I've had at Cornell, period. The man is a genius, and he truly is passionate about Orgo and teaching. His lectures are crystal clear, but this is still a difficult course. Lots of studying is required to succeed. However, Professor Ganem makes it all an enjoyable experience. I recommend him fully"
6181,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,5.0,"Ganem is by far the best chemistry professor Cornell has to offer in my view after taking Gen Chem 1 and 2 and Orgo 1. Out of all chemistry professors I've taken he is the most innately brilliant and teaches in the most organized and understandable way , but is also very personable. I say this even after receiving a lower grade in the course."
6182,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,3.0,5.0,"OK guys I screwed up big time in his class. I got overconfident on the first exam since I got an A-, then was putting off studying, and fell behind immensely. I don't know how I didnt get an F honestly. He's a great teacher but I made huge mistakes."
6183,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,4.0,4.0,"Very clear and easy to follow notes. Difficult class, but he makes it as bearable as possible. Look over his notes for the exam, they help  simplify the book"
6184,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,5.0,5.0,One of the most intelligent and straight-forward professors in Cornell. His lectures are always at comprehensive level. His tests are very hard if you do not spend enough time on the orgo studying. Talking with Ganem will be your most interesting experience if you get closer with him. Dr. Ganem will make Chem 3570 interesting for you.
6185,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,4.0,3.0,"Probably one of the most straight-forward teachers I have ever had! He teaches the information at a very comprehensible level, and he is a very nice teacher. His lectures follow very closely with the textbook, which helps with understanding. As long as you study, go to lectures, and read the textbook, tests are very fair!"
6186,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,4.0,3.0,He's a good lecturer despite the fact that he can breeze over topics sometimes. His tests are pretty straight forward and fair. He doesn't post the notes online either so go to lecture and skim the textbook.
6187,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3570,3.0,3.0,A good lecturer but somewhat impatient if you go to him for easy questions. But he is really an expert and prepared for all hard questions that students have. So get the insight for orgo and go to his office hour. He will be very passionate and nice if you have good questions. However normally students still struggle.
6188,42676,Bruce,Ganem,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3590,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ganem's lectures were always very clear and his exams corresponded exactly to what was taught in lecture. They were very fair if you listened and followed. Aside from that, Ganem was very accessible and helpful during office hours if there was ever something specific I didn't understand"
6190,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE3150,1.0,3.0,"One of the worst and most obnoxious professors I've ever had. Seems nice in lecture, is completely rude during office hours or on Piazza. Homework questions often unclear, lectures don't explain anything. Pointless class."
6191,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1270,1.0,1.0,"The class wasnt difficult but the professors attitude the whole semester was extremely condescending, which indirectly discouraged participation."
6192,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE3230,2.0,3.0,"Reads off lecture slides mostly, hard to keep up with notes. Useful examples that match homework problems. Overall not very engaging and key points are not emphasized so they are easy to miss."
6193,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE3150,1.0,4.0,"Bad teaching, Completed nonsense in the grading, not willing to answer questions at piazza is not enough, he closed the piazza and unwilling to release class statistics,"
6194,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE3150,1.0,3.0,"He either doesn't post the problems to the answers or doesn't post the answers to the problems. He doesn't even post practice prelims online. If you miss the handouts in class, you are screwed. He's also always sarcastic on Piazza, and answers questions with questions. It almost feels as if he's afraid that we learn too much from his class."
6195,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,OR3150,5.0,2.0,He is really good at teaching accounting. I personally find him really funny in class but I might be one of the only ones. You have to go to class to learn how to solve the problems the way he wants. The text book is pretty useful but if you don't do problems exactly as done in class your grade will suffer.
6196,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE9100,1.0,2.0,"Rude professor, I would NEVER take his class again."
6197,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE4860,5.0,1.0,Awesome
6198,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,OR3150,4.0,3.0,exams are pretty difficult and can be hard if you dont attend lectures
6199,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE3150,3.0,4.0,His lectures are pretty good and you really need to go because he doesn't post answers to the problems he does in class and you have to do them the exact same way for homework and exams. Grading is really tough if you don't do it the same way.
6200,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE3150,1.0,4.0,"The professor goes off on tangents during lectures a lot and is condescending and doesn't answer questions on Piazza when asked about a simple topic. Also, the lectures are really boring and aren't worth going to."
6201,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE3150,3.0,3.0,Cares for his students. Reasonably clear lecturer. Small mistakes will lose you a lot of points on homework and exams.
6202,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,OR3150,5.0,1.0,Callister is a really nice guy. He is open to questions and gives a lot of examples during class to help you study. Very enthusiastic and incorporates personal stories in class.
6203,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE4300,4.5,1.0,Best class I've taken at Cornell. Love going to lecture
6204,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1270,4.0,2.0,Dry humor. Tests are easy but curved. It'll be hard to get anything higher than or lower than an A.
6205,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE4860,3.5,3.0,"He is one of the best if not the best prof I've had at Cornell. do the readings before class,  go to class, do the homework to get an A. Paying attention in class usually clears up the topics you found confusing. in class exercises are super helpful. I'm not even an engineer. I took the class because I like cars and I got an A. material isn't hard."
6206,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1270,4.0,1.0,"The class is very easy, especially compared to other freshman engineering classes. Show up to class and go over the material before prelims and you should be fine. Only had 3 homework assignments and one easy group project the whole semester. "
6207,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1270,4.0,1.0,"Math level needed for homework is algebra, easy. Lectures are interesting bc he uses current examples. Some were upset with questions on prelim but they Were in the reading that he assigns. Straightforward class, easy to get an A if you pay attention, maybe without doing so as well. Not curved."
6208,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE4610,4.0,2.0,"Interesting entrepreneurship class. The takeaways from the class were constructing a good business plan, and basic accounting and business skills."
6209,166526,John,Callister,Cornell University,Engineering,ORIE4152,2.5,3.0,"An ""easy"" elective for ORIE majors who want a class with no work, but a class with tons of work for budding entrepreneurs like me. Useless cases, pointless Q &amp; A's to submit for these cases, WHICH ARE 20% OF THE GRADE! He gives the answers to these in class (spends the whole lecture doing so). If he likes you, you do well. Otherwise, you're doomed."
6211,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,5.0,"He is an understanding professor. I took the course for credit in the summer, so there is a lot of content. He explained the concepts in the lectures thoroughly with animations and graphs. Using a supplemental textbook is helpful. I would take this class again!"
6212,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,2.0,2.0,His lecture videos sometimes contradict themselves and his speech often lacks cohesiveness that it makes the material unclear.
6213,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,4.0,3.0,"Those complaining about him promoting disordered eating clearly don't spend time reading the relevant literature. As someone who DOES, and someone who is also on the Eboard of Body Positive Cornell, I can say that is falsity. Levitsky opens your eyes to a perspective few others in the field give. Exams are a bit tricky, so study thoroughly."
6214,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,1.0,3.0,"Material is interesting, but poorly explained. Lecture contradicts itself. Exams have &gt;10% mis-worded questions that are removed. Prior exams provided w/ incorrect answers, yet unchanged. Answers for test changed w/o notice. Prof thinks anecdotal is same as antidotal. Lectures excluded from Blackboard b/c of errata, but used in exam. Bush-league."
6215,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,2.0,3.0,"Yes, it is true that he is funny and engaging. It's unfortunate that his lectures are biased and promote unhealthy eating behaviors. He does not promote body positivity (or even body neutrality) and his class is known to lead many towards disordered eating. If you're going to take this class, be wary of his overlooked biases and manipulated data."
6216,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,3.0,"By far my favorite professor. He is so funny and also an understanding professor. I looked forward to going to lecture. Sometimes they were exciting, but they could also be bland depending on the topic. Taking the supplemental class was also very helpful."
6217,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NHS1150,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, if your go to class and study decently you should be able to do well. Multiple opportunities for extra credit.  Very nice guy, and is super passionate about his field. 100% recommend."
6218,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Levitsky is not only an expert in his field in obesity and nutrition but also a passionate, hilarious professor. His lectures were inspiring. NS1150 material is not difficult but very comprehensive and you would need to know a great amount of details. Very time consuming but his lectures are hilarious."
6219,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,3.0,2.0,I never went to lecture
6220,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,2.0,"Puts up all lectures online, very specific slides,  Tests are a little annoying since they consist of over 100 T/F questions. Overall great class, I learned a lot."
6221,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite classes at Cornell! The class is well organized and Levitsky is so  interesting!
6222,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Levitsky is GREAT. His lectures are funny and informative. He offers rebuttal opportunities after exams, and genuinely wants you to learn and care about your health as it relates to nutrition. Also, the TAs are incredibly helpful and always accessible. I am in ILR, and am so happy I chose this class as my science &amp; technology distribution."
6223,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,4.0,3.0,"As a lecturer, he's fantastic! However, I thought the class was WAY too difficult  for a 1000-level (especially since I'm an HD major and only took this as an elective). The lectures are awesome and hilarious, but the exams were pretty hard for an intro class. You also have to do a pretty extensive term paper at the end, too."
6224,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,2.0,HES THE BEST
6225,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,3.0,Hands down the best class I have ever taken at Cornell!! Take it and you wont regret it!!
6226,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Levitsky is passionate and informed, also very nice. His lectures are interesting (cooking in class, etc.). Every test is TF and has an opportunity to argue points back afterwards. The work load is very low and the paper is very easy if you take NS1160. Just listen in class and you'll be fine. No textbook to buy. Lots of easy extra credit."
6227,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,3.5,3.0,"Professor is funny and the material is interesting. However, a lot of memorization and regurgitation is required. The wording on test questions are sometimes unclear. Take advantage of the various extra credit opportunities that are offered. Take NS 1160 if you can because it will provide sample questions and guidance for the term paper."
6228,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1500,1.5,2.0,"One of my least favorite professors at Cornell so far. Finals and prelims are purely ~120 T/F questions, many of which are awkwardly phrased. Really interesting course material, but Levitsky is incredibly unhelpful as a professor"
6229,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,3.5,2.0,"A solid instructor, however, he is strikingly narrow-minded for a class that requires a particularly unbiased focus. He regularly comments on how to approach nutrition issues from multiple viewpoints and then neglects to do so himself. Also, the class itself is very lazily constructed and arranged. It's easy doe"
6230,202263,David,Levitsky,Cornell University,Health Science,NS1150,5.0,2.0,Levitsky is definitely my favorite professor at Cornell so far. All of the lectures are recorded so you don't have to go to class. Prelims (2) are about 120 questions (mainly true/false and some matching). Final is cumulative. You definitely have to study hard and be able to memorize a lot of info to do well in the class but Levitsky is awesome! :)
6232,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM3030,1.0,4.0,he's mean. super snarky. igor was rough. he was always unnecessarily vague.
6233,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM3030,4.0,4.0,"Was extremely approachable throughout the course and usually available and willing to discuss any challenges/questions about lab. Vagueness in person and in handouts were sometimes confusing, but more often than not, also challenged me to learn more. His lectures went well beyond what was required for labs (apt for a class full of chemists)."
6234,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,4.0,"Purposely makes exams impossible to finish, lecture is useless, not helpful whatsoever"
6235,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,5.0,Lectures were completely useless
6236,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,5.0,Terrible professor
6237,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,4.0,Everything I learned was from the textbook. I should have skipped 90 percent of the lectures.
6238,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.5,5.0,"I thought I used to like chemistry. His lectures are incredibly unclear unless you already solidly know the material. His tests are tough, no doubt about that. Lectures seemed to be unrelated to homework or labs--studying the homework and textbooks are the key to passing. Was fairly condescending in class.  Would not recommend."
6239,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,4.0,Zax is unfortunately one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He has literally described concepts as magic and makes the simplest things confusing. His demos usually have nothing to do with the lecture of the day and he often messes them up.  I generally enjoy chemistry but this was a very poor class.
6240,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,5.0,Lectures were absolutely terrible and because of that it's extremely hard to do the homeworks and tests. Impossible to pass the class without reading the book yourself and viewing Khan Academy videos. Would NOT recommend.
6241,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,4.0,"Prof Zax's lectures are extremely unclear and often painful to attend. His power points look similar to something a 6th grader would create, he's not concise, and he often comes across as very condescending towards his students.  Just read the textbook and do the problem sets. Labs are easy, prelims are not - ""designed so no one would finish""..."
6242,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,1.0,3.0,"His lectures don't relate to any of his homework sets and are very sporadically taught in general. His lectures are often hard to follow, even if you know what you are doing. He has also describe the reason behind some chemistry to just be ""magic."" Questions during lecture have been answered with quick responses that don't clarify what was asked."
6243,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2090,3.5,4.0,"He is a great professor, and makes sure that students who need help can receive it. He is informative, and he tries to make this class fun."
6244,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,1.5,4.0,"All of the hype about Zax is completely exaggerated. He's nowhere near as cruel or intimidating as previous ratings state. That being said, his lectures are way too complicated, and his exams are tough (but not unfair). If you're an incoming freshman worried about this class, don't fear. The material is manageable if you read the textbook."
6245,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,2.0,5.0,"David Zax just has a chip on his shoulders. It seems that he is not only rude to students that approach him for help, but he is also horrible to the Department's grad students and other faculty members. Unfortunately, CHEM 2070 is a ""weed out"" class and a common requirement for many majors; so, it's either this or summer schoolchoose summer school"
6246,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,2070,1.5,3.0,"Totally unapproachable and tough, but the stigma around Zax and 2070 is a bit overblown. I got an A in the class without taking AP Chem and while I worked for it, it's not necessary to go to office hours every week. Prelims are tough, but it's chemistry, so the means are gonna be low and the curve will help you. "
6247,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,2070,1.0,5.0,Very confusing lectures. Does not wait for the class to understand him. Tests are extremely difficult.
6248,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,2.0,4.0,Ugh... Zax. He's just a really difficult test-giver. Doesn't seem friendly although I've never actually tired going to his office hours specifically. Enjoyed his lectures for the most part. It's not his fault chem 2070 is designed to weed people out. Be prepared to work hard.
6249,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"He is a worse professor than Abruna. He presents the basic concepts in class, but expect students to know things to the very detail for homework and exams. His homework was unnecessarily difficult and not good for prelim preparation. He is rude and proud. The only way to do well is to study everything yourself and do a lot of problems."
6250,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,1.5,5.0,Terrible professor. He is even rude to other professors and TAs. It's so unfortunate that almost every science major has to take this course
6251,132224,David,Zax,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,3.5,3.0,Makes topics harder to understand than they should be. Prelim and homework questions are hard and not directly from the book and hard to study for. Material covered was not that hard but he did not teach it very clearly.
6252,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,4.0,4.0,"I feel that Professor Burkhauser gets unfairly criticized by people who feel that any introductory social sciences class should be a walk in the park. Yes, his final is very difficult, but doing well on it is extremely rewarding and cements your knowledge of the material covered over the 15 or so weeks prior. If you take his class, be prepared to think about all of the concepts he goes over and be wary of some trick questions, but also be prepared to learn more about economics than most other professors at Cornell could ever provide."
6253,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,1.0,"He is so boring that I slept in every class. But hey, his class is so easy u have to try to not get an A so what more can you ask for?"
6254,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1101,2.5,4.0,"Final had new material he never discussed, and was not in the textbook. Good teacher, terrible grader."
6255,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,4.0,1.0,"Burkhauser is an amazing professor and really knows his economics! I loved his class so much! There were two prelims and a final. The prelims were pretty easy, and he gave a practice for each one that had basically the same information/questions as was on the actual prelim. The final was harder, but not impossible. I had an amazing semester!"
6256,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,2.5,3.0,"He tends to go off on tangents during lectures and frequently loses his point. He also calls just about every concept ""possibly the most important concept"" that he will teach, which leads to confusion about what to expect on tests. He gives practice prelims which are very close to the current prelim though, so that helps."
6257,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.5,2.0,Very good professor. Don't let the posts here scare you into not taking his class. He's a fair grader and genuinely looks out for his students.
6258,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1011,1.0,5.0,"Dr. Burkhauser speaks down to his students on a daily basis, telling them that they will fail their upcoming prelim even if 70%+ of the class got his clicker question wrong. He is unapproachable and unfriendly and his lectures are extremely unclear and do not prepare you for his incredibly difficult prelims. People walk out of his tests miserable"
6259,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,4.0,"Lectures are very dry and boring. Also, his class was at 9:05am so that didn't help. He uses iClickers for attendance. His two prelims are reasonable as he gives a practice one before hand. His final is a lot harder and there is no practice one given. There are some really good and really bad TAs but attendance at the sections aren't required. "
6260,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,1110,3.5,2.0,"Honestly kind of funny and review sessions are so helpful. If you keep up with the reading and put in effort, you can get an A in this class "
6261,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.5,3.0,"Unlimited attempts on problem sets (google  the answers),  prelims are very similar to past prelims and iClicker questions. The final was difficult. Literally 50% of the questions are in a totally different format than we were trained to answer.  His lectures are boring, says ""uh"" a lot, yells at his TAs during lecture,  mentions UChicago a lot"
6262,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,4.0,3.0,"People are way too tough on Burkhauser. He's a really nice guy that cares a lot about the subject. Problem sets are super easy, and you can take them unlimited times online with no penalty. He personally hosts review sessions, and posts every lecture online. Burkhauser definitely sets up the students for success. Overall, very good professor."
6263,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,1110,1.0,4.0,His lectures consists of asking I-clicker questions then reviewing the results (and repeat). He doesn't teach anything useful and his class makes me dislike economics. I should have taken AP Econ in high school...
6264,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,1110,1.0,4.0,Terrible. Just Terrible.
6265,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,3.0,I always knew he was gonna be an unhelpful and unclear teacher. But the first two exams were absurdly easy so I was fine with sacrificing quality for an easy grade. But the final tested us on things he never said or were in the textbook-some didn't even relate to economics. Avoid this teacher he'll really hurt your GPA and/or passion for econ
6266,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.5,1.0,"Professor Burkhauser is an interesting instructor. He does provide a politically conservative perspective when giving his lectures, but he also teaches the general theory fairly well. There are some days in which his explanations of key concepts are clear, and some days in which they are not. Overall, I thought that the class was a decent intro."
6267,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,2.5,2.0,"I rather dislike Prof Burkhauser. He wastes time doing practice problems instead of teaching new material. Some lectures waste time on court cases that aren't interesting and do not really get me to understand microeconomic theory. His teaching style is a little more preferable for people who are squeamish of math, but I wasn't a particular fan."
6268,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1101,4.0,3.0,"I'm not sure why so many people are giving bad reviews. I found his lectures interesting. Especially since he shows a relevant video clip during nearly every lecture. Makes some pretty funny comments, and some pretty slanted ones too"
6269,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,5.0,"For students who need a professor who is helpful and caring, this is not the man for you. He is very passionate about Economics, but does a very poor at explaining any of the topics. I failed my first Prelim with him and then ended up getting a B+ in the class. I would not recommend him and I truly believe Burkhauser is not fit to teach this class."
6270,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,5.0,"Doesn't teach you anything. I received almost perfect scores on both prelims and got a B+ because the final was nothing from the lecture. If you knew econ, you were set but for some science majors that had econ for the first time, just kills your interest and gpa"
6271,349936,Richard,Burkhauser,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.5,1.0,"His lectures are terrible, discussion sections are the most helpful but you'll end up learning a lot on your own.  10 problem sets that he lets you redo at the end, and both prelims are pretty much recycled from old exams"
6272,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,2.0,3.0,"that himeself ,rubbish classcm1029."
6273,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,4.5,2.0,"Great professor. Very clear in teaching and econ experiments and  practices in his class are generally fun and helpful for learning the material. He is very responsive to students as well, analyzing every student's test result dealing with problems individually. Exams are OKAY but you got to study. I recommend taking his intro class."
6274,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1101,4.0,5.0,not bad but you gotta study like crazy
6275,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1101,5.0,5.0,"Professor Abowd is one of the greatest professors I've had.  He was very willing to help during office hours and tried to make class interesting by making it interactive.  The problem sets were definitely hard, but if you attended office hours or tutoring you could definitely get a good grade.  Abowd was such a great teacher that when final exams c"
6276,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1101,3.5,4.0,"His lectures are very intense and can range from 30-45 slides in one 50 Minute lecture.  He is a very good professor when it comes to making you learn the material, but he is more difficult than other professors teaching this course."
6277,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,4.0,4.0,"If you think Econ is easy, don't take this class."
6278,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,2.0,4.0,"Awful class, never uses the textbook but makes everyone buy it. I didn't learn anything in lecture, he makes everything unnecessarily hard, and there are waaaay too many problem sets. The tests are way to hard, and have trick questions in them."
6279,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,2.0,3.0,"Nice guy. Bad teacher. Class sucks. Too many aplia problem sets. And he uploads them sometimes a day before they're due. Too many of my nights have been ruined by finding out at the last minute that there is a new aplia set due. Also, the prelims do NOT reflect what is taught in class or in the problem sets. For Excel sets, FORM A GROUP. Seriously."
6280,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,5.0,2.0,extremely clear; all the powerpoints are online so you dont even need to go to class.  aplia is a joke. the problem sets are easy unless you are retarded and dont know the basics of using excel (like most people in the class).  tons of practice problems online that are exactly the same as the problems on the tests.
6281,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,5.0,3.0,I loved this class. Abowd is the best professor I have had so far at Cornell!
6282,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,1.0,4.0,he is a terrible teacher. he does not use the book at all and tries to make jokes in lecture [only he thinks they are funny]. this is one of the worst classes i have ever taken. if you can stay away from this class and any other class he teaches
6283,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,4.5,3.0,His explaination and powerpoint are crystal clear and TA's teaching is great. His assignments are bit much but the grading is fair and course materials are interesting.
6284,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,5.0,3.0,Great professor! i had absolutely no prior econ knowledge and i got an A+ in the class because Abowd explains the material extremely well. It's not an easy class but definitely manageable if you put in the time. those who say you need previous calc/econ knowledge and claim that abowd is a bad professor are just idiots who didn't make an effort.
6285,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,2.5,4.0,"Abowd is a very egotistical prof… usually annoying to listen to in lecture. Teaches the class as if it's an advanced econ course; 'expected' to have prior econ knowledge/ have already taken calc in order to keep up.. Aplia and Excel problem sets are very annoying &amp; excessive; For the prelims, * study the old practice tests * and you will be fine."
6286,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,MICROECON,2.5,4.0,"I really did not like this course. Unfortunately, I had to take this course as part of my school's graduation requirements. The excel problem sets are incredibly time-consuming and basically useless. Don't think you'll learn a lot by going to class. You're pretty much better off staying in the dorm and reading the textbook."
6287,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,5.0,3.0,Abowd is an amazing professor. I found the aplia psets extremely helpful in getting students to keep up with the reading and his prelims/final are extremely fair. excel psets take a while to do so start them early. this is definetely a good class to take because abowd really makes sure that you learn the material inside out. i wouldnt change a thin
6288,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,4.5,2.0,"You will definitely learn micro, Abowd is a great professor.  He's so lame but it's adorable and he throws goodies into the crowd if you just try to answer in class.  The prelims and final are multiple choice, which sucks or rocks depending on you.  Seriously BEWARE OF EXCEL PSETS."
6289,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,4.0,3.0,"Very nice prof. Gives prizes when you answer questions. Also very understanding. When you need an extension for a valid reason, he is likely to help you with that."
6290,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,3.5,4.0,"My view is slanted since I suck at Econ, but I do think he assigns a little too much work for only three credits. That having been said, the work helps you develop many different ways of looking at the problems. Prof. Abowd is not a bad guy. Just do the Excel problem sets well in advance and ALL of the old prelims to prepare for the exams."
6291,183393,John,Abowd,Cornell University,Economics,ECON101,1.5,3.0,"this class is useless.  abowd needs to learn that his aplia assignments and experiments are utterly pointless and dont help at all.  his lectures are incredibly boring, and in an attempt to redeem himself he gives out bagels and frisbees in class.  I'm not usually one to be critical of a professor or class, but this is particularly bad."
6293,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3120,1.0,4.0,"Completely mishandled online classes. Expects students to attend online lectures but spends the first 20 minutes nagging and down-talking to students. He has a large temper and has a habit of getting upset with students during lecture. Lectures are rambly and unfocused, may be due to unfamiliarity with online format, but still bad for the student."
6294,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors at Cornell. The topic was difficult, but Professor Jakubson is incredibly willing to help outside of class. The TA was great. He really wants you to succeed, but you have to put in work. Lectures could be a little slow and tests are hard but everything is curved up."
6295,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,1.0,4.0,"AVOID this class. He's a nice guy, but not meant for teaching. No one knows what he talks about in class, and he doesn't use slides or a textbook. Says attendance doesn't matter but passes around a sign-in sheet every class. Psets and tests also make no sense, and means fall below 50. Don't worry, the massive curve will save you. Utilize the TA."
6296,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I have ever had. If you show up with respect and determination George will show you mutual respect and dedication. He makes sure that everybody in class knows what is going on and is extremely personable. Makes waking up for an early class not just worth it but ENJOYABLE! I absolutely recommend taking his class.
6297,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3120,1.0,5.0,This class is a straight up disaster. Tests are much harder than the hw. I think I finished 2/3 of the final. He is difficult to deal with in class or in OH and gets mad when the prelim average is a 50. I would recommend avoiding him at all costs and take 3120 w/ someone else
6298,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3120,1.0,5.0,"Worst class I've taken. Condescending and very disrespectful. He literally makes students chant after him and says things like ""good job, you guys finally reached grade school"" He says he makes us do this to engage in ""educational scaffolding"" but anyone with a brain will know that he's just doing it for the sense of control. tldr:Napoleon Complex"
6299,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3120,1.0,5.0,"AVOID him at all costs. He gave the ""option"" of starting the final an hour earlier with a super long exam that you would't even be able to finish in 4 hours, not to mention that it was not fair for those who chose to show up on time. Questions were tricky and LONG. He didn't provide practice exams and lectures were pointless."
6300,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3120,1.0,5.0,"It depends. If you are a normal human, avoid him."
6301,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3120,1.0,5.0,This was the worst class I've taken at Cornell by far. The material is inherently more difficult and mathematical than any course in the Econ major but Professor Jacobson makes life harder than it needs to be. He flips if you whisper to a friend next to you or fall asleep for a second. Very demanding and has absurdly high expectations for students.
6302,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILR2400,1.0,5.0,"I would not recommend taking Labor Econ with Professor Jakubson. He is a nice enough guy, but he takes the structure out of the material and tries to explain it all like one big story. Grading is very arbitrary as students who got 40s and 50s on prelims ended up getting Bs in the class. Take Labor Econ with Hutchens instead."
6303,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON2400,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor, I honestly learned so much even though I basically failed every exam, and it ended up being my highest grade in the semester. Visit office hours, study the practice exams, and attend lecture. If you have an option to take him then I highly recommend it!!"
6304,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,1.0,5.0,"AVOID Prof Jakubson at ALL costs. He is the WORST. He is nice if you approach him correctly. But, his class is SO hard. The lectures and textbooks are pretty much useless. Go to office hours and take the practice prelims until you memorize the answers (exactly what he doesn't want you to do) the class is impossible if you don't. Disrespectful Prof."
6305,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON2400,2.0,5.0,All test questions are based on practice prelims and problems sets.  There are 2 problems sets about 6 questions each throughout the course. He doesn't grade them he just checks for completion. At the end he curves generously so people who got 40 and 60ish on prelims end up getting Bs for final grades.
6306,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,5.0,4.0,"His class is difficult, but it is fair. His lectures are really helpful and cannot be substituted by the textbook. He really gives a good understanding of basic labor economic thought and theory. I highly recommend taking his class!"
6307,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3210,5.0,3.0,"Professor George was clear, engaging, and most of all cared about actually teaching econometrics to us in practical terms. He made himself available every day after class if you had any extra question. As long as you went to class, did the homework, and participated you should have no trouble getting an A. Great guy- really glad i look this class."
6308,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,2.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE labor economics with Jakubson. For someone who has taken Intermediate level economics courses at Cornell, Jakubson's Labor Economics course was a nightmare. He is disorganized, lectures are like story times, and the more he tries to take the ""math"" out of his material, more he makes the course pointless. Grading is also very arbitrary."
6309,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,2.0,5.0,"no, just no "
6310,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,5.0,1.0,"Jakubson just wants his students to learn and if you put in the effort, you will absolutely get a great grade. I understood more about economics in 1 week of his class than I did from an entire semester of micro or macro econ. Do the problem sets, go to office hours, show you're making an effort, and an A+ is very possible."
6311,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,4.5,2.0,"Professor Jakubson was an amazing professor, definitely one of my favorites. I took the course during the summer and learned so much! I recommend going to office hours. Jakubson really cares about his students and wants them to learn the material, if you show progression throughout the course you will be fine! Thanks George!"
6312,246616,George,Jakubson,Cornell University,Economics,ILRE2400,5.0,2.0,"Amazing Professor... I entered his class having failed Labor Econ already and ended with a B+.. pretty good considering I failed the first two tests. More importantly, I'm now an econ minor. Thanks Prof. Jakubson!"
6314,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed class with Prof Bailey. I loved lecture, and enjoyed the somewhat open ended problems, since he graded them fairly according to how open ended they were. I loved the final project, and found him helpful when I chose to wait to talk to him instead of a TA. Was reasonably understanding about asking for extension."
6315,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,1.0,5.0,"Professor Baileys teaching has subpar performance in class as a lecturer, and he is unhelpful during office hours. He is unable to convey the material clearly, and unfortunately he does not teach well."
6316,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,1.0,5.0,Terrible experience.
6317,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,2.0,5.0,"I took this over summer. Lectures were usuall rambling, especially having to do with calculus and other unrelated math concepts, and the few homeworks that we had were nearly impossible with what he taught in class. One assignment was so hard that he extended it 2 times, but only on the last day after we'd all agonized over it and gotten no TA help"
6318,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,1.0,4.0,"This guy is really the worst. Literally zero resources available in either class I took with him, he won't even give a syllabus or set up a course website. Loves to hear himself talk and always winds up overcomplicating things in the lecture/assumes people understand things that haven't been taught. ""Open ended"" HW just means there's no guidelines."
6319,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,2.0,5.0,He teaches the class at a really fast pace.
6320,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,3.0,4.0,"Intro python over the summer was hard with him. I wouldn't say impossible, but expect to earn your grade. homework was hard(our last one was a graphical transportation simulation ). The final was doable, but you really got to understand how to explain the material (open-ended). He explains well enough, though, even when it's tough for intro cs ."
6321,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,2.5,5.0,"TAs were always there to help at night. Professor Bailey was a bit to complicated for the Introductory course I took. He gave one long and (usually) difficult homework assignment every week or week and a half. He's pretty funny and a good guy to talk to, but be prepared to work hard if you want a good grade in his class."
6322,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,1640,3.0,3.0,"Computing in the Arts was a very interesting class. More than other classes, it is what you make of it. Bailey gives you a lot of room to succeed or fail in projects and papers. His lectures are interesting and engaging, even if it is unclear how his current lecture fits into the overall class, which often happens."
6323,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2800,5.0,4.0,"Graeme Bailey is an incredible lecturer. Really passionate about the material and very accommodating to any issue you might have.  Class if really really difficult for the material covered and requires a lot of time for hw...office hours necessary. If you want an awesome teacher and difficult class, recommend"
6324,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2800,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Engaging in lectures and very dedicated to making sure every student is learning the material. Homework can occasionally be time consuming, but are also very rewarding and worth the hard work."
6325,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2800,1.0,5.0,"I have never met a worse professor in my life. This course taught by him is literally harder than all the courses I have taken at Cornell combined. Not only is he extremely unclear during lecture,his homework is also nothing but a torture to do, if not just to look at. I learnt nothing from him"
6326,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,4.5,4.0,"Extremely interesting professor.  I actually enjoyed going to lectures.  Assignments are hard and time consuming; however, i liked his style of ""do it yourself"" projects where you start from scratch rather than filling in pre-organized methods/classes."
6327,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Bailey is extremely knowledgeable, not only in his command of the material, but also in how he understands and relates to students. He's very kind and caring. He's a very interesting person who makes everything come to life with his enthusiasm for the material, which is really obvious when he explains things. I highly recommend him as a prof."
6328,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS2110,5.0,5.0,Here is how the class is structured: 1) you will immediately be thrown into an extremely fast paced introduction of Java and be expected to pump out applications from scratch 2) you will learn important data structures that Bailey makes you implement in your homework 3) you will be rewarded if you work hard. Goodluck the work is worth it in the end
6329,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,5.0,He teaches fast and his homework is tough but you will learn how to program and you will be glad to have had him. He taught me more about math then any math teacher I ever had before him. He's always available after class and he even helped me with an essay unrelated to the class.
6330,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS430,5.0,1.0,great professor and great class.
6331,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS220,4.5,3.0,"GREAT PROFESSOR, THE CLASS IS NOT SUPER ORGANIZED BUT YOU WILL LEARN A LOT FROM HIM!!!!"
6332,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,JAVA1110,4.5,5.0,"One of the most fantastic professors I've had. Hilarious, in a Douglas Adams kind of way. Lectures move FAST, assignments are very open-ended. Often felt overwhelmed until I started speaking with him after class and during office hours. One on one, he's incredibly helpful and caring! Be sure to seek him out outside of class!"
6333,172666,Graeme,Bailey,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,4.5,5.0,"Love this prof! Class is hard, but Bailey makes it worth going - so glad I had the chance to learn from him! :)"
6335,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS11,5.0,2.0,"Walker White is an amazing and inspiring professor - I will never forget him lecturing with a miserable sore throat. The assignments were interesting and very doable. The exams are the hardest part as they are very theory-heavy, don't put off studying to the last minute because you did well in the assignments. Luckily lecture vids are posted."
6336,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,4.0,hes absolutely awesome. explains things perfectly. makes total sense. would take again 100000/10
6337,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,5.0,"Take this class in a semester when you aren't taking too many other classes. As a non-CS major, I found the concepts difficult to understand at first, but there are many helpful TAs and consultants. Start assignments early! Don't rely on consulting hours too much in the latter part of the semester... wait time can consume your entire evenings."
6338,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,4.0,"Walker White is one of the best professors at Cornell. He is highly dedicated to each students's success. He also takes into account upward trends when assigning final grades, which is awesome considering a lot of people have little coding experience going into the class. I could not recommend more."
6339,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,4.0,3.0,"Pretty chill, no surprises in the class"
6340,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"Super knowledgeable, totally enjoyed this class, Some clicker questions, lectures posted online afterwards, projects pretty fun to do, consultants are also so helpful and one time stayed until 1 am helping people- you will be taken care of if you try in this class"
6341,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,4.0,The best intro. cs professor!!! Made me switch my major to cs.
6342,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,4.0,"Walker White is an amazing professor. Even as someone who never took a CS course, he made sure everything was comprehensible. He's widely regarded as the man who changes people to CS for a reason."
6343,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,4.0,4.0,"He goes out of his ways to help students. I personally found this class hard, probably because it's my first time studying CS, but it's definitely worthwhile."
6344,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,He explains things well and I love how he mocks Yale's CS major ppl LOL.
6345,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"Walker is a gem. Amazing lecturer, gives interesting and helpful projects/weekly homework. Really cares about how you do in the class, and is always ready to help in person or via piazza (piazza is also a gem &lt;3 ).Also, grades super fairly. Your grade is based on knowledge of the material, and not (completely) on how others did in comparison to you"
6346,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"Labs and assignments helped me teach the material, except the last assignment took me forever to finish (had no programming experience before coming to the class). Tests can be hard, but they are reasonable. There are many consultants available for help, but the hours can be very crowded around the time when the assignments are due."
6347,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,4.0,3.0,"Course is not too hard if you put in the work; for me, assignments and labs made up for exam scores. Highly recommend attending consulting hours, etc. Prof. White is concise and effective at communicating material, and somewhat humorous, but a bit cold/impersonal (since he has so many students) otherwise."
6348,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"Walker White is a fantastic teacher. He is dedicated to the success of his students and is always willing to give advice. All material in the course is extremely useful and all work is assigned to prepare students for future CS classes and the exams. His lectures are clear and very informative, well developed and easy to follow. All around great."
6349,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,"Highly recommended. He knows so much about the content and very passionate in teaching students. I have never done CS before and came in I honestly hated CS coming in, but his class is so good that I am currently considering majoring in. Anytime you bring up Harvard CS, he can roast them for an hour straight and its the funniest thing ever."
6350,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,4.0,"Even though this class was very tough, his passion for CS and the material he teaches is infectious. Great teacher; if you can take CS 1110 with him."
6351,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,4.0,"Professor White is so funny and clear. I look forward to his lectures every Tuesday and Thursday because I'm always learning with the occasional laugh. The class itself is a lot of work, especially with no CS experience, as it seems like half the class is always a month ahead which is a bit frustrating. But, don't let it dissuade you. Highly rec'd."
6352,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor. 'nuff said
6353,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,4.0,5.0,Good teacher. Very Difficult course.
6354,1705832,Walker,White,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,3.0,5.0,"Walker is a great teacher.. for those who have a CS background. I took CS1110 in the fall and Walker adjusted his teaching style to a faster paced one since many people in my class had CS background. Projects became progressively harder and although there were many resources so many people needed help, those resources were barely useful."
6356,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRHR2100,4.0,4.0,No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher
6357,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST212,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Velleman - and though I took his class nearly 22 years ago - provides a good structural framework for how to approach statistical analysis in general. It helps develop a sense of how it should be done. Listen to this brilliant man. It will do you good. The class I took 22 years ago had a different code, so this is my best guess what it is now."
6358,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,4.0,4.0,"sounds like someone who did not pass the course last Spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him. He did not even teach the Fall, 2016!"
6359,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,2.0,4.0,The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.
6360,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,1.0,5.0,"We use DataDesk, a program he invented 30 years ago instead of something more modern. His ego is so big we can't use a real stat program since it was made by someone else. Makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program"
6361,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,1.0,3.0,He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats
6362,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,2.0,5.0,"Promises to be ""your statistician for life"" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can"
6363,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,1.0,2.0,I've never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he hasn't even taught yet
6364,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,1.0,5.0,"I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket"
6365,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,STSCI2100,4.5,2.0,"Very clear lecturer, excited about statistics. Does have an ego but you don't interact with him much anyway. If you study and practice with the questions at the end of the chapters, you'll do well on the exams. Put in the work and you'll learn Stats. I understand the subject so much better now. Take this class, you won't regret it."
6366,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,2.5,3.0,"Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers, quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable."
6367,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILR2100,4.0,1.0,The class is super easy. Go to lecture and do the homework and you'll be set. He bumps everyone up a huge amount at the end of the year.
6368,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,2100,5.0,1.0,"I took intro stats and although Velleman is known for ""taking the math out of stats"" the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences. And he's super approachable. If you study, you'll do well. When he says he's taking the math out, he just means you don't have to do rote calculations; you THINK and logic it"
6369,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,2.5,4.0,"Takes all the math out of statistics, which has its positives and negatives. Weekly homework and various different assignments required. Tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking. Class can be painfully boring at times. Best part of the class is the textbook which Professor Velleman wrote himself. Easy textbook to read."
6370,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,2100,5.0,3.0,Great textbook written by him
6371,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,4.5,3.0,"Velleman is an excellent teacher. I actually enjoyed reading the textbook (which he wrote), due to its conversational style and interesting examples. He posts all his lectures online, so attendance is not mandatory. If you choose not to go, you should still watch the lecture videos - they help with the homework."
6372,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,STSCI2100,4.5,3.0,"I loved this class. Velleman is excellent professor, perhaps the best I've had so far at Cornell. I had no experience with Statistics before his class, but his lectures and textbook were so clear. You can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and he's great at explaining them. I strongly recommend him."
6373,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,STSCI2100,4.5,4.0,"Great guy, conveyed a lot of passion about the subject, and gave a great intro to statistics. He really understands what he is teaching and to whom, and the class is well structured, even though there was some confusion about the textbooks/DVDs. He was also very democratic as to grading exams, removing confusing questions post-exam."
6374,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,4.0,3.0,Good professor.
6375,250500,Paul,Velleman,Cornell University,Social Science,ILRST2100,5.0,3.0,"Easily one of the best (ILR) professors out there. The way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations, and instead, requires you to critically think and understand data. He's exceptionally smart, but very approachable. Tests are fair, but can be tricky; grades are curved at the end."
6377,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,5.0,3.0,"Harry is by far the best professor I've had thus far at Cornell. He's funny, engaging, and his class teaches really interesting/important material. There are a lot of readings, but if you get the general idea you'll be fine and he tells you what you need from the readings in lecture. Highly recommend if you are in any way interested in this class."
6378,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,1.0,I really love this professor. You can tell he genuinely cares about every student. I just showed up to class everyday and paid attention. I read the spark notes of the assigned reading and skimmed the slides the day before the exam and aced it. The class is actually interesting and not stressful. He goes on a lot of tangents but still worth taking.
6379,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,5.0,3.0,"Segal is by far the most inspiring prof I've had at Cornell. His lectures are captivating, hilarious, and mind-blowing. Enjoyed every minute of his class, it felt more like free therapy. Segal is empathetic and accommodating and really wants his students to be healthy, happy, and successful. 100% recommend if you're at all interested in psych."
6380,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,4.0,3.0,He's sweet and makes the lectures really interesting. I really enjoyed this class.
6381,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,5.0,3.0,Harry Segal is an absolute gem. Cares deeply about what he does and makes the material easy to understand. Don't bother doing the dense textbook readings (all available online) because Segal highlights in lecture what you actually need to know. Read the case studies. Listen when he talks Hamlet. Review lecture slides before exams. You'll do great!
6382,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,5.0,3.0,Harry Segal is the best professor that I've had during my time at Cornell. He really makes the lecture material come to life and you can tell that he has the respect of everyone in the room. He genuinely cares about his students and I hope that I can take another class with him in the future. I've recommended this class to all my friends!
6383,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,5.0,2.0,"Amazing lecturer. He genuinely cares about his students and makes every lecture fun and the time fly by. Tests aren't bad as long as you actually do the readings! Even if you're not a psych/human development major, you should definitely take this class"
6384,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,4.0,3.0,A very good person who made the lectures entertaining and fun. Not much information covered in lecture but such a nice and genuine guy.
6385,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3700,4.0,3.0,"Best lecturer ever. He really loves teaching Freud and the mind. But I really couldn't follow his lectures about the biological side of things. Reading can get overwhelming. Overall though he is funny, adorable, and not too tough on tests. If you read everything with time then the A is possible."
6386,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,4.0,3.0,"So nice, truly cares about his students.  His lectures are usually funny, and relatiely interesting.  There is Hamlet in this class, which I personally don't like, but it is not too bad.  Overall he is a great professor!"
6387,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,4.0,4.0,"Wonderful person - funny, lively, intelligent, caring, and extremely helpful if you're interested in clinical psych. However, I didn't love his teaching style - lots of words packed onto slides that he blows through in between anecdotes/rants and Hamlet performances - and his tests varied between joke questions and extremely nitpicky ones."
6388,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH32502820,5.0,3.0,"One of the best profs at Cornell by far. He's super kind and approachable, has very interesting lectures, tests are very fair and the readings are sometimes long but not detrimentally so. Although I'm a pre-med and not necessary looking at a career in clinical psych I've taken his courses just because of how great of a prof he is. "
6389,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,4.5,1.0,"Professor Segal is one of the very few Clinical professors on staff. He's very caring about his students and his lectures are interesting. Tests are fair and the final was actually incredibly fun. Another rater commented on email, it's much better to go to office hours, he gets a ton of emails and isn't quick to respond but he definitely cares!"
6390,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,5.0,2.0,"by FAR my favorite professor at Cornell.  he is laid back, smart, direct, helpful, and really cares about his students. exams are fair and easy to do well on as long as you prepare. bonus: he usually makes his multiple choice questions have 1 choice that is clearly a joke, simultaneously making it easier and entertaining"
6391,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,4.5,2.0,"Definitely one of my favorite professors/classes at Cornell. Professor Segal is funny, interesting, and down-to-earth. The tests are fair and as long as you study you will do fine."
6392,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,3.5,1.0,"Segal is nice enough, but his lectures don't really have any substance. Him reading hundreds of words off slides and acting out Hamlet are annoying. But course is simple, only two prelims and final. Readings are fairly light and you can probably do well just by going to class and review sessions. Easy A and all in all worth the occasional headache."
6393,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,2.5,3.0,"Dr. Segal is an interesting teacher. He wasn't particularly well suited to be a lecturer for such a large class but he kept things interesting with personal anecdotes. However, his tests were at times unclear and relied heavily on insignificant details aimed to see if you attended class (not if you actually knew basic psych)."
6394,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH3250,5.0,3.0,"By far the best professor I've had at Cornell so far. I learned so much from him. The course challenges you to think about yourself and the people around you in a different way. Absolutely loved it, and him."
6395,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,1.0,3.0,"This professor is ridiculously boring. I fell asleep every class 5 minutes in. I had an urgent issue during the semester, sent all my professors an e-mail and he was the only one who didn't respond. I e-mailed him 6 more times in the next week or so and he ignored every one. He obviously doesn't care about his students."
6396,163181,Harry,Segal,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH101,3.0,3.0,"He's really nice but it is hard to get a lecture of 900+ interested in intro to psych. The tests are very fair if not a little easy. If you are interested in the material, take it with him--also visit his office hours he is SO SWEET."
6397,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,2.0,5.0,He made exams unrealistically hard for what we learned and graded them entirely too harshly.  I think he also assumed that people generally had more knowledge than they actually did.
6398,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.0,3.0,"Semi-boring lecturer, but if you can stay awake, lectures are helpful in understanding homework and lab quizzes."
6399,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,2.0,5.0,"goes very fast, doesn't really seem to care"
6400,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.0,4.0,"I had Professor Crane for CHEM 2070. He is a good teacher but sometimes his teaching style was not the best for the subjects we were learning. However, he does care for his students, and will help you if you go to his office hours. His prelims are formidable and very difficult, but if you put in solid effort you should be fine. I enjoyed Dr. Crane."
6401,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.0,4.0,"Dr. Crane made Chem 2070 a LITTLE better (just a smidge), but overall CRAZY CLASS! You either a) really have to love Chemistry or b) want to be a doctor super badly to get through this class without saying, ""I HATE CHEMISTRY!"""
6402,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.5,4.0,The best gen. Chem professor. Willing to work with you if you ask.
6403,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.0,4.0,Lectures were fairly clear and easy to follow. Does a lot of practice problems in class. Tries to make it interesting by doing a question every class.
6404,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,2.5,3.0,"Well played, Brian, well played. The lab reports were exhaustingly time-consuming. You could tell he planned his jokes in great detail before he came to class. He unnecessarily switched the chalkboard quite frequently. His voice cracked frequently during the semester and he tried to pass it off as a cold. Overall, fair testing but eh as a professor"
6405,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.5,3.0,"The lectures were pretty engaging and he almost always did in class demos relating to what was lectured on. It was cool! The exams were fair, and his lectures were never boring. He always provided examples on the chalkboard which were very helpful. He would often crack a joke which is pretty nice for an early morning class."
6406,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.5,3.0,"Definitely better than Wolzcanski! The first half was clear, but pretty fast. Stay on top of things!"
6407,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,2.5,5.0,No
6408,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.5,3.0,"Everyday that goes by sitting in Wolczanski's lectures I miss Crane so much more. He's not the best, but with Wolczanski right next to him Crane feels like the best teacher ever."
6409,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor, hard class"
6410,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.5,3.0,Definitely better than Wolczanski (or however you say his name).
6411,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.0,3.0,"Professor Crane was a pretty clear lecturer, however he was very condescending whenever I had a question or asked for help.  His tests were decent, but his rude attitude generally detracted from the class.  "
6412,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,4.5,2.0,"Fantastic professor. He usually goes over problems in class like the ones on the homework so you'll get an idea of how to do it. His lectures are pretty clear and understandable. His test wasn't that hard either, he's also funny and likable."
6413,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,5.0,3.0,worship this man while you can
6414,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,4.5,2.0,"Great lecturer,  clear and methodical in the way he presents the information. Also a really nice guy."
6415,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,3.0,3.0,"Professor Crane is fairly clear (although his handwriting can be a little small). His lectures are pretty well organized and he gets all the information across. He seems to be a fairly well-natured and an understanding person. The prelim wasn't very difficult, just do what is required from the class (prob sets, study group, lec, discussion)."
6416,216853,Brian,Crane,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,4.0,4.0,Brian is cool. He does a demo of a reaction every class so far except for today's lecture. He tries to be funny and create a relaxed atmosphere. He's good at explaining most topics. Very understandable.
6417,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM1150,1.0,5.0,"In 4 weeks of class (intro class for non chem majors btw, some of whom had no chemistry experience) he taught us practically everything that I learned from high school and AP chem classes. The work that he assigned to us and the material we had to learn was way beyond the scope of the class. Please listen to the people below: DONT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!"
6418,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CS2090,1.0,5.0,"I had Prof Wolczanski during my first semester at Cornell. After completing my degree, I can say with certainty that he was the worst professor I had during my time here."
6419,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,2.0,5.0,"Not the best lecturer... doesn't rely so much on the textbook as on his own class notes, which are extremely confusing. Many of the topics he chooses to cover are above the level of a first-year chemistry class. That being said, the insane difficulty of his exams forces you to study the material on your own and learn a lot."
6420,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,4.0,"Horrible lecturer. It's clear he's smart as a whip and knows a lot about chemistry, but he has no idea how to teach it. Goes way beyond what should be taught in a general chem course."
6421,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM6050,1.0,5.0,"Horrible guy, unwelcoming, gives you a thousand judgements if you don't know something. Homework is wayy too hard."
6422,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM410,5.0,4.0,"Wolczanski's Inorganic class was excellent. He covered all of the basics and did a solid job simplifying the more complicated concepts. The material might be a little hard to grasp at first, but I seemed to grasp it without going to office hours. Overall, a great professor that likes to challenge his students and grades fairly."
6423,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,- very bad professor . He goes in depth in what you don't really have to know and therefore has you confused the ENITRE lecture . His exams are unimaginabley long and difficult . He wants you to be able to derive hard concepts rather than understanding the concepts you actually need to know in gen Chem. Terrible !
6424,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"Lectures are long, boring and meandering. He has a somnolent effect on students and expects too much prior knowledge. Self-study is essential to pass. He  made no attempt to make the lecture interesting and it was jarring compared to Professor Crane. Tests set by him are unbelievably difficult. All in all, the worst teacher I have ever had."
6425,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,2.0,4.0,"Smart guy, but not a very good teacher. Taught concepts well beyond the scope of the course that were largely irrelevant to the vast majority of students without a lot of outside research; then tested for how well you were able to manipulate his lecture notes as opposed to for understanding of the material. Tried WAY too hard to be funny..."
6426,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,5.0,"Hated this class the moment he stepped in. He rambles a lot, and I think half the time he did not follow the curriculum. Instead, he discussed his own personal research and went far beyond what was necessary during lecture. Was very disappointed with his ridiculous exams, but he is occasionally funny and is truly, extraordinarily brilliant."
6427,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,4.0,"Chem 2090 with Prof. Wolczanski sucked.  His lectures are not worth attending; just read the lecture notes he posts online.  Tests are hard, you'll somehow be saved by the curve.  I still don't understand chemistry.  He also has a wicked sense of humor (not in a good way- think mean)."
6428,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"Lectures can be  long and draggy. You can tell he is really smart and really into his research, however, he is just not right to teach an introductory chemistry class. He spends a greater proportion of his lecture talking about some abstract concepts and the worst part, is you can barely find the topics in the prescribed textbooks."
6429,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,Poorly organized lectures that ramble for too long on irrelevant material. Assumed much too high a level of understanding for a general chemistry course. Lectures are absolutely useless.
6430,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,worst professor I have ever had avoid taking a class with him at all costs that is all you need to know.
6431,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"If every TA has to say ""I don't know how to explain this to you guys in the context of what you're learning since I learned this in advanced inorganic chemistry,"" then something is wrong. He teaches all these terms and concepts without explaining what they are, and he teaches stuff that is nowhere in the textbook, so the textbook is useless. AWFUL!"
6432,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"Spends half the lecture doing complex derivations, then tells you it's not important and won't be on the exam. "
6433,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,5.0,4.0,"Professor Wolczanski is said to be a very tough teacher, but everyone should go to his office hours and actually have a conversation with him before judging. He's an absolutely amazing professor and he truly is there to help. I wish I realized this earlier, so that I could've taken advantage of the time I had with him as a professor."
6434,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"Clearly very knowledgable, but he is unable to pass information to students in an effective manner. His lectures are disorganized, and he assumes far too great of a basic level of understanding for a general chemistry clas."
6435,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,This guy is the worst Professor I have ever had in my life. I have had professors who don't speak English that I would take over this guy. I would rather have my right ball chopped off than have to take another one of his classes.
6436,154042,Peter,Wolczanski,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,absolutely terrible
6438,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2211,5.0,3.0,"Jane Marie-Law knows Japan extremely well and uses her class as a gateway to observe Japanese through multiple lenses. If you are interested in cultural analysis her class is enjoyable. There are many opportunities to earn extra credits---""bonanza points""---so getting an A won't be a problem. Definitely go to her office hours. You'd learn more."
6439,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2211,5.0,3.0,"Her lectures are super inspirational and information-intense. Assignments are a bit confusing because of her flow-of-conscious writing style, but you can definitely make sure of them if you email her or use office hours. This class asks you to do perceptive learning, not literary analysis all the times. Besides this, just enjoy your class!"
6440,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,RELST2273,5.0,4.0,"Easily the most life-changing class I have ever taken. Professor Law is incredibly caring and wants each and every one of her students to engage with the material and succeed both inside and outside of class. Not an easy course (lots of reading and papers), but if you put in the work you will do well!"
6441,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2211,5.0,3.0,"She's an amazing person and an amazing lecturer but word to the wise- either skip the readings or skip lecture (you won't want to though, she's so funny and interesting) but don't do both. You have to write your papers on something. And even if you get all As on your papers DO THE BONANZA POINTS AND MAKE SURE YOUR TA KNOWS YOU DID THEM!"
6442,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,RELST2273,5.0,4.0,Professor Law is a passionate professor and talented lecturer who cares deeply for both the course and the students taking it. This class is a lot of work but an easy A if you just do the work and demonstrate a genuine intellectual interest in the material. One of the most engaging courses I have taken at Cornell.
6443,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,RELST2550,4.0,2.0,Professor Law gives interesting and engaging lectures; she is a natural public speaker. While her teaching style may not be for everyone (not much feedback or opportunity for participation in class) she genuinely cares about the material. It's just a British style of teaching. This is an easy A if you demonstrate any passion for the subject.
6444,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2273,4.0,4.0,"Professor Law is a great storyteller and is really passionate about environmental issues and activism. I learned a lot and her lectures were fascinating. However, it was a ton of work and took a larger time commitment than my higher level STEM classes. You will learn a lot, but prepared to spend a lot of time on the class."
6445,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,RELST2273,5.0,3.0,"Whether or not you care at all for religion or the Environment there's a lot beyond that one can pick up: how to communicate worldviews/convictions to influence behavior, nuance our understanding of issues, and better relate to our thinking processes. You'll think across disciplines, learn esoteric facts and grow a conscience/hope to save the world"
6446,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2273,5.0,4.0,"Professor Law is an extremely caring Professor. She wants her students to succeed and will put in time outside class to make sure this happens. Course is very interesting, Professor Law makes students care about the material beyond what's required for the class."
6447,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2211,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, my favourite class so far at Cornell. Every single one of her lectures was extremely interesting to listen to. The class was well structured and comprehensive, allowing students to examine Japan from a variety of perspectives. ""Required"" film screenings outside of class were also fun. A lot of work, but an extremely fulfilling class."
6448,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN4400,5.0,4.0,"In Tibetan Buddhism, Dr. Law taught me some of the most important content that I have yet to come across inside or outside of a classroom. Every lecture was like a gold platter of indelible lessons. Particularly, I valued learning about the state of Tibetan culture in refuge, and how to think critically about history as propaganda."
6449,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,RELST2273,5.0,4.0,"Professor Law's Intro to Religion class was by far the best course I have ever taken.  No matter what your major is, taking a course with her will drastically increase the quality and thoughtfulness of your life."
6450,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2273,5.0,3.0,"Take this class! Dr. Law is the most incredible professor I've ever had. She is full of so many fascinating stories and experiences, and I enjoyed every second of her lectures. There are no exams (just reflective papers) which was a refreshing change from other courses."
6451,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN227G3,5.0,4.0,"It should be a requirement to take this class. Law is w/o a doubt the most brilliant, engaging and fun professor I've ever had. She challenges you to think in new ways, takes you on amazing field trips and walks-the-walk of a sustainable and mindful life. This class changed my life. Take it, you won't regret it, plus you'll get to meet her goats!"
6452,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2273,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, great class. There is a lot of work, but putting in the time and effort is worth it. This goes for the class as a whole -- if you put in genuine effort, you'll get something truly valuable out of it. This can be difficult, as she makes you critically examine yourself and your life, but if your open to changes, they can profound."
6453,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,RELST2273,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Law has honestly changed my college experience. She exposes you to so many new things in this class, and it is one of the very few courses that has truly made an impact upon me. Highly recommended to anyone who needs a distribution requirement. Be warned there are out of class field trips and many essays, but still completely, 100% worth it."
6454,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2211,4.0,3.0,"She is really popular! As CS &amp; Stats major I hate history/social studies class and took this one for distribution requirement, but Professor Law actually made me enjoy the class! Her way of teaching makes the classes extremely interesting and inspirational. Readings &amp; lectures are not mandatory. No final exam, and only a few papers needed. Not hard"
6455,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN3316,5.0,4.0,"An amazing teacher and a wonderful class. Professor Law is just the right combination of compassionate, articulate, and sassy. Despite some apprehension going in, I really developed a fondness for Buddhist art, especially with the chance to touch centuries-old pottery. Absolutely go on the Kamakura trip if you can, it really is once in a lifetime!"
6456,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,RELST2273,4.5,3.0,"Includes immense outside of class commitments, from weekend field trips to nighttime movie screenings, that were all very interesting but made this course much more time consuming than most intro courses. Expect a lot of work at the end. Interesting class with a great professor--lectures are never boring. Great class overall."
6457,192501,Jane Marie,Law,Cornell University,Religious Studies,ASIAN2273,5.0,3.0,"Professor Law's passion and enthusiasm for sustainability and religious studies is inspiring. The out of class field trips were extremely effective, making the class enjoyable and very different from anything else I've taken at Cornell."
6459,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN3900,1.0,3.0,Awful professor. Never disagree with her on anything. Her way or the highway!
6460,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPANL217,1.0,2.0,Her teaching skills are questionable at best. Some of the readings contain very disturbing details.
6461,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2170,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I had. She is easy to approach and class with her is very enjoyable!
6462,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN4370,5.0,2.0,"Simone is not only one of the smartest people I've ever met, but she is engaging, funny, and open to the ideas of her students. Out of all the Spanish courses I've taken, she's created the most comfortable environment for participation. I'm shocked by all these bad reviews; she's inspiring and down to earth despite her impressive qualifications."
6463,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPANL2170,1.0,1.0,"If you want to learn something, take this class with Maria Antonia or another professor. Even if Simone spent 100 years on a remedial teaching journey, her hatred for students would prevent her from actually evolving into a somewhat decent instructor. She knows it too, hence all the self comments she is writing due to low enrollment in her courses."
6464,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2235,5.0,4.0,"Without a doubt one of the most memorable professors that I have had here at Cornell. Her background as a medievalist gives her a unique perspective and this, among other things, allowed me to connect the medieval period of Spanish history to that of contemporary Spain. In terms of the class, she gives a lot of creative freedom as well."
6465,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPANL217,1.0,1.0,Simone is literally a bully in every sense of the word. She preys on young students.  Her relentless efforts to write positive reviews herself won't change every day reality. She lacks the respect of both students and faculty.
6466,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2170,5.0,3.0,Simone is literally the best. She is a professor you will look back on 30 years from now and remember what she taught you.
6467,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2170,5.0,3.0,"Simone, aside from having written five books in different languages, is a passionate and caring professor. I love her and her classes!"
6468,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2235,1.0,4.0,Almost poked my eyes out! Simone's insecurity is only matched by her infinite hostility for her own students. Her lack of scholarly publications compared to other professors speaks for itself.
6469,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2235,5.0,3.0,One of the best classes and professors at the university! Professor Pinet was always willing to help me improve my writing or just discuss class content. She made me think of certain ideas in such mind-blowing and new ways. Overall I really enjoyed this class.
6470,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2170,1.0,2.0,"Lectures aren't interactive as Simone only wants her favorites to talk in class even when they say things that lack basic analysis. Essays are fine and quite short in general. Simone does take attendance in every class, though."
6471,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2170,4.5,2.0,"She's an amazing teacher who is beyond nice and laid back. Of course, you need to try to some degree and a clear comprehension of Spanish is required. However, she makes the course enjoyable regardless of your skill level."
6472,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2235,4.0,2.0,Simone is willing to help as long as you care and are passionate about the subject.  She is fair in her criteria and gives you the chance to succeed as long as you put in the effort.  As long as you participate the class should be fine!  One of my favorites so far at Cornell.
6473,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2230,1.5,2.0,Simone may be hostile at times. Papers are simple and quite short. Just participate and you are guaranteed a decent grade.
6474,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2203,1.5,2.0,Unsure as to what would be more painful... another twice-a-week class with Simone or or being eaten alive by a bull shark. Lectures are endless and she mocks you if you don't say exactly what she thinks is right. Write down everything she incoherently speaks and give it back on every essay. Forget other options if you want to pass.
6475,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2230,1.0,3.0,"Just awful. The worst professor I have had in my entire life. Mean, unclear and a total nightmare. Any interest I had in pursuing a minor was crushed by this class and this woman. "
6476,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPAN2230,4.5,2.0,"I loved Simone's perspectives class.  She taught a ton, and, as we were all interested in Spain as a country, it was fascinating.  We were always asking questions and getting amazing, thoughtful answers.  She set the tone for my time abroad, and I'm glad that I took her class."
6477,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,2000,1.0,4.0,"Simone is the worst professor I have ever had. The only opinion that seems to matter to Simone is her own. If you do not agree with her, she will tear you apart. Although she is smart, this is clearly the wrong career for her.  Once you get on her bad side, it is impossible to get a good grade. "
6478,528773,Simone,Pinet,Cornell University,Languages,SPANLIT2170,1.0,2.0,"This is a required survey course for majors and not many professors teach it. I have fixed feelings about Simone. As a rule, it is best not to ever contradict her and to stay on her good side. Grades are entirely subjective but if you keep that in mind and don't argue with her, it's easy to get great marks."
6479,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH192,3.0,3.0,"Very very easy to do well without going to lecture. The only hard thing is that everyone does well, so the prelims being easy are not really that helpful. Honestly if you just understand the concepts, a lot of the tests is just figuring it out right there and then and not that much of studying hard."
6480,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2940,5.0,2.0,Prof. Terrell is a great guy! He has a funny sense of humor.  I enjoyed attending lectures.  He clearly explains linear algebra.  Great class!
6481,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2940,4.0,3.0,"Brilliant and funny! Makes the material super fun. Linear Algebra is not the funnest subject, but his lectures are worth going to :D"
6482,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,3.0,2.0,"Lectures were sometimes boring and not always very helpful. That being said, there will be some lectures that are absolutely vital. Tests were completely fair."
6483,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,3.5,2.0,"Terrell is an okay teacher. He likes to crack jokes (some of which I don't find funny). After some time going for his class is almost pointless because you almost die of boredom. His prelims and exams are very straightforward and easy, just read the material and you'll ace it."
6484,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,4.5,2.0,Great professor! He explains the intuition behind all the methods very well. Those who complain he is unclear are simply not paying attention in lecture. Prelims are straightforward and test that you know all the different ways of solving differential equations.
6485,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,1.0,4.0,"The class itself seemed to be a collection of various subjects haphazardly stapled together with no driving theme or learning objective. The professor seemed more intent to humor the class than to teach the material. It's not that he is a bad guy, it's just that he seems too smart to teach the class without making it unclear."
6486,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,2.0,2.0,Horribly unclear. He's nice but attending his lectures is a waste of time.
6487,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2310,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Terrell is awesome. Humorous at times but really trys to hammer home the concepts to make sure you grasp everything. Sometimes he can get a bit off topic, but his tests are very fair if you know the material. He is also amazing in Office Hours, and really wants you to learn the material. Overall, Great Guy, Great Professor."
6488,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2940,4.5,2.0,"Had a different prof during the spring and wound up dropping then, and I can say Terrell's a lot better. Over the summer, we had 5 weekly tests instead of 2 prelims and a final, which broke studying into more manageable chunks. Lectures were reasonably clear. Gilbert Strang's book was a very good choice of book."
6489,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2940,5.0,2.0,"He is absolutely fantastic at teaching 2940 over the summer. He's great at explaining the material and doesn't mind if students ask questions. The class is graded off of 5 tests (with corrections!!) and 5 homeworks. If you're at Cornell over the summer, definitely take this class."
6490,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,4.0,2.0,"Great lecturer, but is more entertaining than informative, since lectures covered basic material presented in the homework. I prefer a professor who covers more difficult examples and assumes you understand the basic material; if you prefer to learn from the lecture and not read the book, he might be your man. Funny guy, not very challenging."
6491,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,4.5,2.0,"Terrell has a tendency to go off on tangents, although this is rare. Overall he is enthusiastic, and sometimes even funny. Good at explaining and interpreting the material for students. Helpful during OH's too. Prelims were more than fair and he even allows corrections. Bottom line: good guy, good professor."
6492,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,3.5,3.0,"He is OK. He is sometimes way too theoretical / rambles on stuff completely irrelevant to the course. Unfortunately, he sometimes puts that stuff on his exams, which sometimes contain the strangest questions. His teaching is fairly decent - fairly clear and interesting, but sometimes he's too slow / doesn't emphasize the important material."
6493,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,5.0,3.0,"Very clear, enthusiastic, and engaging. You'd be lucky to have him as a professor"
6494,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2310,3.5,4.0,"A difficult class, but Terrell is much more helpful than the other teacher (Dennis)."
6495,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,1.0,5.0,Doesn't explain the material well. Not helpful at all at office hours. Expects students to know everything and thinks low of you if you don't know it.
6496,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,4.5,2.0,"Terrell is a great guy - he was excited about the material he was teaching and its applications.  1st prelim was too easy, second didn't seem to reflect what he suggested we study for it.  Homework usually involved proofs, (not too many problems assigned)."
6497,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,2.5,4.0,"Dr. Terrell's lectures were good up until Prelim 1 (possibly because it was largely stuff I saw before in AP calculus) after which the quality began to decline; he more or less completely stopped making sense by the time we got to partial differential equations. Prelim 1 was super easy, prelim 2 was needlessly difficult. The final was ok."
6498,132173,Robert,Terrell,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,4.0,3.0,"The lectures were clear, organized, and the explanations were easy to understand. He cared about his class learning what he was teaching. Good handwriting and external examples. The course didn't have too much fluff. Tests avoided excessively hard problems. Homework frequently was too long."
6500,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,5.0,3.0,"Krasicky's an amazing lecturer. His demonstrations help with understanding the material a lot, and he's just generally good at explaining things. Logistically the course was also run very smoothly, and grading is very fair. If you put in the work, you should end up with a decent grade since the course is curved pretty highly at the end as well."
6501,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Krasicky is amazing! I was fortunate enough to have him as my TA for 1112. He is passionate and energetic about physics and he's always good for a laugh, which made discussion sections with him enjoyable. I learned so much from him this semester. His office hours are incredibly valuable. He will challenge you but he will inspire you to succeed!"
6502,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I've had so far! Lectures are super helpful, TAs were great, workload wasn't too much. Show up to lecture for iClicker questions and for fun and entertaining demos."
6503,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,5.0,3.0,"Lectures were amazing. The content is pretty easy, but the class does take up quite a bit of time."
6504,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,4.0,4.0,Krasicky does great demonstrations!
6505,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,4.5,3.0,"His lecture demonstrations are awesome and provide insight into the content he's teaching. Would definitely recommend taking 1112 with Prof. Krasicky. He's always happy to help, as long as you put in the time and work into his class. He's not willing to help slackers one bit. "
6506,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYSICS1112,4.0,4.0,"1112 demonstrations were amazing. The class was incredibly well organized and thought out. If you put in effort, you are guaranteed to pass and will likely do better than that if you understand the material. Krasicky will help you if you ask politely and show an effort to understand the material, but he does not tolerate slackers whatsoever."
6507,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,1112,5.0,3.0,Krasicky was awesome: he really wants you to understand what's happening in the course. He appreciates when people pay attention to the lecture and does a great job of keeping it interesting. I had a really rough second prelim and he immediately made time to see me and go through the test with me. I would take the class again.
6508,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,4.5,3.0,"Krasicky is the man! He's super enthusiastic and really tries to get the students to think critically about physics. The prelims and final were absolutely fair if you were diligent about going to lecture (which is required). I feel like he's a little less approachable in person, so make sure if you need to ask him something that it's important. "
6509,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,4.5,4.0,Best professor I've had so far. He is so enthusiastic and has so many demos prepared for lecture. Very clear lectures and fair tests.
6510,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,4.0,Krasicky is the best. I never thought I would be able to enjoy and understand physics as much as I did with him as my prof. Definitely seek him out during office hours. He's very helpful one on one. But only bother him with real questions.
6511,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,3.0,"Krasicky is awesome, he makes lectures so entertaining. And this is coming from someone who hates physics. I avoided taking this class for a few semesters, and was pleasantly surprised by how interesting he made the material. Tests weren't too bad if you knew the homework and lecture notes well."
6512,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,2.5,3.0,Dr. Krasicky is great at demos. He has very deep understanding of physics and does a great job relating his understandings to the students using his planned demonstrations. Read ahead of class though as it ended up helping me close to the last few weeks of the semesters. Be  prepared for Curious Cat and his ridiculous acts.
6513,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,2.5,5.0,"Krasicky really has a good grasp on the subject that he teaches, but he can't seem to simplify it for his students.  With pages on pages of derivations for simple equations I tend to get confused   about basic concepts.  His tests seem unreasonable because of their misleading wording and his ridiculous use of Curious Cat."
6514,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,3.0,I've absolutely hated physics since high school and it's always been my least favorite subject. Professor Krasicky was very lucid and made the topics extremely easy to grasp. He made me genuinely appreciate physics more.
6515,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,5.0,2.0,"He is AWESOME! His demos make the lectures really fun and interesting. He is very helpful if you have a problem. I went every week to his office hours, during which he explains the homework. He made me love this area of physics (i used to find it a little boring, but not with him!)"
6516,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,4.0,3.0,"Awesome demonstrations, interesting applications and great sense of humor. He is a little quirky, awkward, and obsessed with cats, but overall and amazing professor. I highly recommend taking his class- make sure you go to lecture!"
6517,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,5.0,3.0,:)
6518,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,2.5,4.0,"He knows his material and his demos are good. Lectures you should go to. However, as a professor, when I asked him for help he isn't the nicest guy on the block. Kind of heartless but I guess that's what happens when it's such a huge class. Wasn't particularly helpful in my opinion and taking his class made me dislike physics even more."
6519,226122,Philip,Krasicky,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1112,5.0,4.0,"Looked forward to his lectures every day.  His demos make physics concepts seem more applicable and just plain fun.  The iClicker was used for participation points, not graded on correctness, which made lectures less stressful.  It's not an easy class, but you won't regret taking it."
6521,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,1.0,Bruce is legendary.
6522,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,1.0,"Oceanography and Bruce truly changed me as a person and my entire perspective. The class is super easy, but the real takeaway is becoming more aware and active the current crises of climate change our planet is facing. Bruce is hilarious and this class is a must take for anyone at Cornell, can not recommend enough!!!"
6523,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,1.0,"Prof Monger will change your life. He really cares about his students and making sure they learn instead of regurgitating info for a test. The lecture slides highlight exam material and a night of rewatching lectures will secure an A. Don't worry about your grade, seriously. Take this class if you want to be inspired to change the world."
6524,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,BIO1540,5.0,3.0,"Great class, important and interesting material. Dont underestimate oceans though, theres a lot to memorize for the exams."
6525,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,2.0,"Not only is this class easy, but it is amazing. Bruce is so inspiring and delivers the content really well (designed for everyone, not just science kids). I want to spend the rest of my professional career working in sustainability because of this class. Everyone should take this class before they graduate."
6526,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,4.0,"NOTE: 1560 has become more difficult compared to previous terms (as compared to comments by student who took it before). The course still holds very high value in oceanography, climate change and natural science knowledge for both major and non-majors. Bruce's stance and passion have not changed. Still amazing lectures. Beware of lab component."
6527,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,BIOEE1540,5.0,1.0,Oceanography with Professor Monger changed my career aspirations entirely. I am now going to pursue a master's in environmental policy because of how his class inspired me to help protect our Earth from climate change. Even if you just watch the lectures online before the tests (I didn't attend a single class in person) you will learn something.
6528,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,2.0,Bruce is the BEST. Incredibly passionate and inspirational.
6529,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,BIOEE1540,5.0,3.0,Professor Monger is one of the top 3 professors I've had at Cornell. He's the man.
6530,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,2.0,"Great class except his pronounciation of ""height"" as ""heighth"" and ""across"" as ""acrost"" makes much of his lectures unlistenable. Paired with the many typos in his slides make for a frustrated lecture. ""Cold tong"""
6531,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS154,5.0,1.0,Professor Monger is one of the most passionate professors I've had at Cornell; I've heard many stories of students who've taken his class and afterwards claim he changed their lives. Easy class with some memorization. Pay attention in class (or watch them online) &amp; study lecture slides and you'll do really well. Great science for non-science people
6532,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,1.0,"One of the best professors Ive ever had at Cornell. Beyond the material, his grading criteria is super clear, he posts lecture videos online, and he literally highlights what you should know for exams in red. Watch the videos and take notes at 2x speed, youll be set. Not to mention he is phenomenal at inspiring you re: climate change"
6533,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Monger's class was the best. Attendance is not mandatory, but you should always show up for your own good! At first, the class felt super technical and somewhat of a drag. Looking back, however, I'm so thankful for how much I've learned in regard to climate change. Very inspiring, and overall super rewarding as a ""life lessons"" class."
6534,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,2.0,Bruce Monger is an exceptional professor. He is truly inspirational. Put in a little bit of work and you will get an A!
6535,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,2.0,1.0,"He got preachy in the second half, but, if you can stomach that, really easy way to boost GPA and fulfill distribution requirement."
6536,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,1.0,"Hands down best professor I've ever had at Cornell. He genuinely wants you to do well. His class is truly inspirational, and he does an amazing job at teaching and informing you about current issues and makes you want to be a proactive person. Class was very enriching. Definitely take it."
6537,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,3.0,Literally the best teacher ever. He is so passionate about oceanography and so caring about his students. His interest in the subject and the fact that he is such a nice person makes your day so much better.
6538,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,BIOEE1540,5.0,2.0,"Wow. What an amazing passionate professor. The class is an easy A if you keep up with the work, but you honestly should just take the class for the professor. He's extremely passionate and makes learning oceanography entertaining and manageable."
6539,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS1540,5.0,2.0,"Oceanography is an interesting topic, but the class wouldn't have been nearly as interesting if it was taught by someone else. Prof. Monger is passionate about climate change and wants people to make an impact outside of class. Class is definitely not mandatory but Prof. Monger gives such good lectures that it's worth it to go."
6540,778584,Bruce,Monger,Cornell University,Science,EAS101,5.0,1.0,One of the most inspirational profs. Least amount of work required. Homework was one journal entry a week about your feelings on the topic (170 words). The tests are detailed but all on the slides and highlighted. you dont have to go to lecture but make sure to memorize the slides before the test or watch the lectures online.
6542,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,3.0,"As a psych major, found this course relatively straightforward. Extra credit and office hours really helped me get the A. Extremely interesting and relevant course material that I talk about them to people outside of class. Don't focus on the minute details, but sit back and listen to understand the concepts, and ask a lot of questions!"
6543,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,3.0,4.0,"PowerPoints are so vague, if you miss lecture, all you will see are pictures on the slides with no notes to help you out. He wrote the textbook, so expect to read a lot. Prelim questions are so specific, which is not ideal for an introductory course. Passionate about his field, but VERY politically bias in how he presents materials."
6544,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,4.0,4.0,"Prelims are very difficult, but the papers are graded easy. Hard to do really well but if you do the readings and go to to class you should be in decent shape. He's not very accessible, the times I asked for help I didn't get it. Personally I'd avoid this class specifically, it was too much work for an elective."
6545,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,3.0,5.0,Gives extremely convoluted explanations on topics. Not the best lecturer. Least favorite class at Cornell so far. Does not really care about logistics. Do not take it if you are not a psych major. I have taken several classes that covered some experiments taught in this class and still find it quite hard to follow. Tests are unfair and hard.
6546,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,3.0,The best professor I have ever had. Class is interesting and thought-provoking; tests are very fair and doable if you do the readings. 10/10 would recommend!!!
6547,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,4.0,Professor Gilovich was perhaps the greatest lecturer I have ever had while in school. He made each class interesting and applicable while crafting lectures to interest his audience. My only regret is that I didnt take a course with him sooner to allow me to take more courses that he teaches. Highly recommend
6548,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,3.0,4.0,"Tests you on ridiculously minute details, oftentimes mentioned in passing during lecture or readings. ALWAYS go to class, do the readings beforehand, study, and you will do fine. Slack off and those tests will kill you."
6549,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,4.5,3.0,"Captivating professor. He posts lecture slides, but I found that I could have taken better in-class notes. He includes questions directly from the textbook on the prelims and final, so read the textbook. He doesn't return prelims but lets you see them during OH, and he reuses several questions on the final. Final40% Prelims20% Paper10%"
6550,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,4.0,"The best professor I've ever had. Interesting, intelligent and incredibly talented at explaining concepts during lecture. Go to lecture and do the readings and you'll be fine. Pre-lims are slightly difficult but fair. Lecture is always interesting. Term paper is easy but make sure to incorporate a lot of your own ideas "
6551,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,3.5,4.0,"The lectures are fine. The problem is the material. You learn little about social psychology. Instead, you memorize experiments. Take the class if you are a psych major. Otherwise, stay far away.  He also claimed that psych majors know more about economics than econ majors, so I guess his brain just works differently than everybody else. Ironic."
6552,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,3.0,Gilovich is a great professor. He is smart and his lectures are incredibly interesting. He is quite a rockstar in psych and he exudes knowledge about the subject. The tests are straightforward though they require a very thorough reading of the textbook
6553,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,1.0,4.0,"Terrible class. Gilovich clearly cares and knows his stuff, but the class is very poorly organized. It's a large lecture for a topic that NEEDS to be taught through discussion, so lectures end up being him rambling about random topics in psychology. Grading is unfair, super harsh, and nitpicky. Unless you're a psych. major, DON'T take this class."
6554,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,4.0,4.0,"Professor Gilovich is one of my favorite professors. He really knows his stuff and shares it with you in a really interesting way. I really enjoyed his lectures. That said, his tests can be hard, even when you study; there's a lot of nitpicky details from the books. Overall, definitely take the class. You learn a TON of interesting things!"
6555,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,4.0,4.0,"Loved this class, so many interesting ideas applicable to everyday life. He is a fantastic lecturer and he also offered a review session before every test that I would recommend. This class is hard however. Make sure that you do the readings because his exams can be tricky. One of my favorite classes at Cornell."
6556,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,3.0,"My favorite class at Cornell, definitely take it. So interesting and applicable to daily life. Gilovich is a rock star in the psych world and he knows all the material by heart + wrote the textbook. Both prelims and the final are horribly specific. Read the textbook word for word. Attendance not required but will definitely help you on the test"
6557,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,4.0,4.0,"Psych 2800 is a great class, the tests are a little tricky but overall everything was good. Make sure to do the readings!"
6558,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,4.0,3.0,"Really great lecturer. Tests are a little hard and readings can make or break you on exams. He is a little scattered sometimes but overall I had a great experience with him as a lecturer! He also held review sessions before tests, which were nice."
6559,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,2.0,"A great professor! His lectures were fun and interesting every time, and he played cool music and videos. Very understanding and helpful."
6560,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,5.0,4.0,"While psych 2800 requires a little bit of work, it is worth it.  Very interesting and a must-take for psych majors and a great class for non psych majors."
6561,155949,Tom,Gilovich,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2800,4.5,4.0,"I took him for Social Psych and the class was fantastic! He's a really great lecturer and the material was really interesting. His prelims were really hard though; he's REALLY into nitpicky details from the book that you could overlook. Despite the hard tests though, it's a great class!"
6563,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,3.0,Prof Pizarro is amazing - his lectures online were so high quality and hes super funny and very very kind.
6564,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,3.0,Prof Pizarro is awesome. His lectures are so well produced and really engaging. He is so funny and really cares about us getting something out of the class. The online format is tough bc of the weekly quizzes but Im pretty sure thats all run by TAs. Professor Pizarro himself is amazing. Would 1000% take another of his classes.
6565,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,1.0,"Favorite professor by far at Cornell. His lectures are like stand-up comedy. You probably don't need to go to lecture to pass, but he's so funny you'll want to go. I wish I could retake his class - it's unlike any other. You do need to study, but take advantage of the summary pages and quizlet for vocab. Extra credit can also boost your grade lots"
6566,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,"Pizarro is an engaging lecturer. He makes class interesting. Although lectures are great, they are far from necessary as tests are largely based on lecture slides and the textbook. Cram the night before for tests and you're good."
6567,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,Awesome guy! Very interestingpeople should definitely also check out his podcast
6568,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,The chillest professor I've ever had. Lectures are amazing. Just take notes and read the textbook. Prelims are multiple choice.
6569,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,Pizarro is the coolest :)
6570,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,3.0,Really entertaining and interesting!
6571,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,"Engaging, funny, hot. What more could you ask for?"
6572,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,"Daves a great guy  lectures may not be mandatory, but its worth going just for the professor."
6573,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,"Really knowledgeable, interesting and engaging. Learned a lot. Perfect level of difficulty for an intro course!"
6574,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,1.0,1.0,"Take this class if you want an easy A, minimal in-class learning, and negligible workload. If you want to comprehensively learn and appreciate psychology as a subject, I wouldn't recommend it. Lectures are useless and contain very little substance. 80% of the material is exclusively found in the textbook, so the class is basically auto-tutorial."
6575,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,4.0,2.0,"Pizarro is a really good professor. He's funny and if you wait long enough after class you can even talk to him. The class is not very demanding, show up if you want (or don't) the only thing you'll miss are the potential EC questions and hearing his jokes. You don't really need to keep up with the reading, but make sure to do extra credit!"
6576,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,3.0,"A lot of reading but as long as you do it, which you will, cause you'll have no other choice, you're likely to get an A. Extra credit really helps with that too. I think you need a 94 to make an A but believe me, the work is worth it. Also, lectures are fun because Pizzaro adds all these videos and experiments which make it interesting."
6577,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,3.0,"Best class at Cornell! This is a must-take class and you're ensured an A as long as you read the material covered well. Lectures are amazing and Prof. Pizzaro is hilarious. The exams are all multiple choice questions and the material is very interesting. If I could, I would definitely take this class again. Also, you get extra credit very easily."
6578,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,3.0,"If you show up to class, take notes, and read the textbook you will do fine in this class. If you don't read, prepare for the exams because they will wreck you. Besides that, Pizarro is an amazing lecturer that makes sure you always feel engaged and aren't bored in class."
6579,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,One of the best lecturers I've had. His lectures are really interesting and all you really have to do is read the textbook and study his slides. Super chill
6580,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,4.0,2.0,"Pizarro's lectures are funny and interesting, but he is very difficult to get a hold of outside class. However, there are a huge number of TA's who hold office hours and review sessions and are generally really helpful. The tests aren't as easy as people claim, but they're pretty fair and if you study you'll do well. Plus there's extra credit."
6581,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,Great class if you are looking for something not stressful. Lectures were interesting and contained a lot of information on the test. Professor was always energetic and engaging. One of the best lecturers I've had at Cornell.
6582,927429,David,Pizarro,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH1101,5.0,2.0,"LOVE PIZARRO!!!!! Take this class, you won't regret it."
6583,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,3.5,3.0,"Honestly a great professor who makes the material interesting by both expanding on it and throughly expanding on it. Though he barely involves student opinion/answers in his lectures, so if you get a chance you better not embarrass   yourself. But overall explored the material thoroughly and his outlines prior to the lecture made note taking simple"
6584,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,4.5,1.0,He presents the material very clearly and lectures are organized and interesting.
6585,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,4.0,4.0,"Even though Kramnick is retiring, I have to leave a review because he's just that amazing. He's the epitome of a brilliant professor in need of a hair stylist. His lectures are mind-blowing: his ability to make anything interesting made me look forward to every lecture and motivated me to really put effort into his class. Highly recommended!"
6586,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,1615,4.0,3.0,An incredible professor who is world renowned.  I absolutely loved Kramnick.
6587,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3665,2.0,3.0,"I was really interested in the subject but it felt like all he did was read from the textbook. Made the class quite boring and hard to stay awake. It could have been a better class. The TAs were also very uneven! Overall, a manageable amount of work and the course was fine, but it wasn't amazing or anything."
6588,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV3665,1.5,3.0,Obviously a very smart man but he spent 75% of every lecture reading from the textbook. I was very interested in the subject but didn't feel like he was very engaging. The class could have been so much more than it was.
6589,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,5.0,2.0,"Excellent class, really interesting"
6590,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3665,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor that managed to engage me with a subject I had little interest in. Clear, accessible, and not unnecessarily difficult I recommend everyone take a class with him."
6591,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT6075,4.5,3.0,"Kramnick is the epitome of an old school, laid back, brilliant professor with wild gray hair. 1 assignment for our grad seminar (a paper) that doesn't have a due date. He said we could hand it in next spring if we wanted. Lots and lots of reading but he's realistic in that he realizes we have other courses and it's hard to read everything. Take him"
6592,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,5.0,3.0,"I am currently taking a online Winter session with Kramnick and must say he is a genius. As a Senior, I have worked with many Professors and Kramnick is in my opinion, the best professor in the Government department. Cornell is lucky to have him! If you are a Gov major you must take his Intro to Political Philosophy course."
6593,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3655,4.5,3.0,"Fascinating, old-school professor who is always on his game. Lecturers are interesting and detailed. Would have liked for him to let the class participate and ask questions, but overall, good professor."
6594,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3665,5.0,3.0,"Kramnick was a fantastic professor! Got me excited about American Political thought. Lectures could get a little boring by the end, but overall, they were great. I've never felt so connected with a professor in a large lecture class."
6595,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3665,4.5,4.0,"Kramnick lived up to the reputation. He is brilliant and it shows. He may be getting old, but he hasn't lost his touch (like Lowi has). I highly recommend anyone interested in government, philosophy, or history to take American Political Thought."
6596,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV1650,4.0,4.0,He's really helpful
6597,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,4.5,4.0,"Kramnick is an award winning professor who really knows his stuff. If you do the reading, you should have no problem.  I didn't and still managed a B+. TA's tend to be very knowledgeable also although they teach in completely different styles and are a little tough on papers"
6598,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,4.0,2.0,"He was very clear in his lectures, but also painfully boring. Many people (myself included) found it extremely difficult to stay awake in class. He's very knowledgeable about what he teaches, but he tends to repeat himself over and over and lectures became monotonouse and uninteresting. On top of that, there is a lot of reading. easy to get behind."
6599,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,4.5,4.0,Kramnick is very interesting and enthusiastic about his teaching subject. However there is a TON of reading and TA grading is pretty hard. There is a midterm and a final as well as a term paper so there isn't a ton of work but it also makes it easy to get behind on the reading.
6600,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1615,4.0,4.0,"The lectures make the class super easy. If you pay attention, the readings will only become supplements to your essay. The TA's grade harshly, but that is how it is with all Gov TA's at Cornell. Kramnicks passionate, and it really makes the lectures better. He would save a whole lot of time by not repeating the same point over and over again though"
6601,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3665,4.5,3.0,"Has an incredible love for the material and is a great lecturer. Someone you'd want to be your grandfather! Not too difficult a workload, with 2 essays and a final exam, but the lack of assessment kind of encourages you not to read...and you don't exactly need to know the readings until the final."
6602,145427,Isaac,Kramnick,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT3665,5.0,2.0,"Amazing class, as was expected having taken 161 with Prof. K."
6604,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM3100,4.0,3.0,"Good lecturer, very energetic, and fair grader. Her class is a little tough, but you will be fine if you did well in the intro stats class ."
6605,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,3.0,She was a great a helpful professor. Lectures aren't mandatory and you can still perform well in the class without attending lectures. The discussions were the most useful part of the class so take those seriously.
6606,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,4.0,3.0,"Cindy is a dynamic lecturer and a great person. She cares about her students doing well and will ensure everyone has the opportunity to succeed. Sections are super helpful. Cindy made stats enjoyable and if you study, you are guaranteed to get A's."
6607,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,3.0,"Cindy's class was a great introduction to the world of statistics and came into every lecture full of energy! If you put in the effort (going to office hours, properly doing the HW) you will definitely end up with a good grade. Don't bother purchasing the textbook, just go take pictures of the HW questions from the library or the OH room."
6608,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,3.0,"Cindy is one of the kindest and silliest professors I've had. She comes in with a great attitude every day and does not let anything get in her way of having a good day. Some of the material is hard to grasp, but there are so many resources available to you so that you can understand and succeed. Also she is good about giving points back on exams!"
6609,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,1.0,"The sections, homework and lectures all reinforced concepts that we needed to know, and the exams were very fair and based on these assignments. Participation is recommended because a % of your grade is derived from your participation in random in-class activities. The sections are helpful, but the lectures are made extremely amusing by Cindy."
6610,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,2.0,"Go to lecture because 1) it's easy to understand and 2) she gives out random participation points. Also go to section because what you don't understand in lecture, you will get in section and it's free points. Also buy the course packet because it's all the notes you'll need."
6611,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,3.0,Great class! Would recommend taking it for anyone interested in statistics.
6612,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,4.5,1.0,"Probably the goofiest, nicest, &amp; most likable professor I've had. It's difficult to learn the material as she teaches it, but the course is arranged so that you're able to master it before the exams. Lectures got a bit monotonous near the end of the semester, but her personality is always refreshing. Her course packet is insanely helpful. AWESOME!!"
6613,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,2.5,3.0,You will have weekly sections and discussions in this class. My TA and section saved my grade. I found her lectures hard to follow but I also normally struggle in large lectures. She randomly takes attendance so if you happen to miss a day she takes attendance it really sucks. There is almost always office hours since there are so many TAs.
6614,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,4.5,3.0,"Wonderful professor! She's funny and goofy but that livened things up in class. Her ""brain breaks"" in the middle of lectures were also a lot of fun. I didn't do great on the first prelim (nobody really did) but if you go to her office hours (or the TAs) you'll do just fine. They're all so helpful and they really want you to succeed."
6615,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,1.0,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
6616,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,3.0,SO great!! I dont even like stat that much but she's awesome
6617,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,3.0,"Loved her class. Didn't do so well on her first prelim, but I would recommend going to office hours and her office hours and you should be set for the course. Not hard material, she is very good about explaining it all, and if you check your homeworks in office hours, I don't know why it's not possible to get an A+."
6618,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,2.0,"I believe she is the best professor at Cornell! She is the rare combination of interested in her students, kind, intelligent, and great at communicating concepts. I wasn't very interested in taking statistics but because of Professor Van Es, it quickly became my favorite course. If you study and do homework you will get a good grade. Take it!"
6619,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,4.0,"I couldn't have taken stats with any other prof. I am NOT a math person but her personality, explanation, and section layouts really help. It's a lot of work, but not more than any other 4 credit class. The homeworks are long but it really makes sure you understand, since there's a lot of material to be covered. Textbook's not necessary but helpful"
6620,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,4.5,3.0,"Cindy is an amazing person and teacher. She uses humor and her lively personality in order to keep students' attention in lectures of otherwise dry stuff. All of the class material is in the lecture packet, and the book is literally only used for a few homework problems. The class isn't a breeze but one could get a good grade with some effort."
6621,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,3.5,5.0,"Cindy is a great stats instructor, but she needs serious help choosing her TAs. As other students already wrote, TAs did not know much and were even rude at times. They seemed to have been chosen randomly since their stats knowledge was shockingly deficient."
6622,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,3.5,4.0,she's a hard teacher and the class is massive. her TAs were bad and there were definite favorites in the class. they didn't explain anything/weren't helpful at all. i really wish i had take ilr stats in hindsight. only plus was that i managed to sell my textbook for a decent amount $
6623,151911,Cindy,Van Es,Cornell University,Business,AEM2100,5.0,3.0,"Cindy is the best professor I have ever had at Cornell thus far! Lecture is so much fun and you learn quality material! If you hold up your end by attending lecture, paying attention and doing the hw and section work, she will help you get an A!"
6624,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,2.0,2.0,"Lowi probably used to be a great lecturer, but now he just rambles all class and occasionally says something entertaining.  Everything depends on your TA, so try to get a good one."
6625,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,1.5,2.0,Great guy. Not the best teacher. Class is really boring and TA's do literally all the work. Get to know your TA and be really nice to him/her.
6626,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT111,3.5,2.0,Take.  This.  Class.  Ted Lowi is entertaining and brilliant.  My friend and I quote him to this day (15 years later).  If this isn't why you came to college then I don't know what you're doing.
6627,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV101,3.0,3.0,Very subjective grading by TA's. Class was pointless to go to. Just read the textbook and you will be fine. Dont need to read the other books given.
6628,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVTGOVT,3.5,2.0,"A good class, but grading is done entirely by TA's and can be very subjective. Don't need to ever go to lectures to get an A, but in general I did enjoy his lectures. Not sure I would take it again since I didn't learn much (had previous knowledge) and expected to learn more."
6629,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,2.0,4.0,"Lectures have no relation to the graded course material, the grading is done only by TA's and is entirely subjective, and some of the TA's are absolutely unforgivably awful. If you have an easy TA this class will be a breeze.  If not you can be completely screwed.  Nonetheless, for one of Cornell's most famous Professors, this class was really bad."
6630,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,4.0,3.0,"Lowi's class certainly had a bit of a disjointed feel to it; the few assignments (midterm, final, two papers) seemed random and not directly related to course material. That said, Lowi's lectures are fantastic, and well worth going to for his learned (and fiery!) commentary on both past and current events. A fun course to take for sure."
6631,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,3.0,4.0,"Lowi is an awesome lecturer. But don't look at the 1111 designation and think you can blow off this class, there's a ton of reading each week (you can get far behind if you don't skim some of it going into section). The grading is pretty hard/arbitrary as well. Exams are based on pre-posted essay questions, and outlining them is time consuming."
6632,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,2.5,3.0,"Although Lowi is an interesting lecturer and a pretty cool guy, his lectures are totally irrelevant to the course and to the tests/papers. The class itself wasn't that great--grading was done by TA's and seemed totally subjective. The tests weren't that hard, but seemed to be graded arbitrarily as well. I wouldn't recommend this class."
6633,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,1.5,4.0,"Not such a fan after taking this class; grading is subjective (that's up to the TA, who was a joke), and lectures aren't as clearly organized and unbiased as he promised they would be.  They were also pointless, not necessary to attend.  Interesting lecture style but overall the class was unsuccessful at teaching me how to think about government."
6634,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT1111,2.0,4.0,"The lectures were really long, boring, and irrelevant to the readings and the tests.  Grading is very subjective.  Section was not helpful in reviewing the material."
6635,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV111,5.0,3.0,"Best professor ever! Teaches like he's a preacher. Always has entertaining, relevant stories. He brought in Janet Reno once to guest lecture. Great professor, great material, best class ever."
6636,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT111,2.5,2.0,"As far as Gov 111 goes, you will only see Lowi in lecture. He is brilliant, but information given during lecture is rarely tested (but they are worth listening to anyway). The class is pretty easy, get to know your TA and you are golden. Four grades the entire semester. I'd give it the highest ""easy"" score but A+'s are non-existent."
6637,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT111,4.0,2.0,"Professor Lowi is a god...his lectures are accessible and engaging but offer such new and brilliant insight into American Government. Listen to his lecture about the problems with bureaucracy in order to make sense of why this class has big problems: the tests are poorly constructed, no one has to attend lecture, and some of the TAs are awful.."
6638,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT111,3.0,3.0,"Lowi is one of Cornell's big-time professors, but seems to really care about his students. The class has quite a bit of reading, and lecture wasn't always helpful. Really take advantage of your TAs because they'll be your main source of info/help."
6639,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT111,3.5,2.0,"Lectures are amazing, not mandatory but the only way that I got anything out of this class was from his wonderful, funny, brilliant lectures."
6640,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT428,2.0,3.0,"Great teacher, although sometimes over everyone's heads.  Not a hard class, and only one (although 15page) paper outside of preparing for exams, no other work.  for exams, he gives you 6 essays ahead of time and then one-two on the actual test.  You need to do some outside reading for the exams/paper.  Manageable class and interesting professor."
6641,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT111,4.5,1.0,"Class is really pretty ridiculously easy, but if you actually want to get something out of it, you definitely can. Most stuff on the exams are pretty much common sense, but lectures are at a higher level (although because it is an intro course and the TA's do the grading, most of this stuff doesn't show up on exams). Lowi's a genius."
6642,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOV111,2.5,1.0,"By far the easiest gov. course. Entire semester consists of just 4 graded tests/essays. All the grading is done by the TA, so make sure to get on his/her good side. Midterm and final consist of 2 essays and 8-10 IDs each. Essays are given BEFOREHAND, and IDs come straight out of the textbook's vocab. section. Lectures are unecessary. Very Very easy"
6643,129943,Theodore,Lowi,Cornell University,Political Science,GOVT111,1.5,3.0,"You don't really need to go to lecture, just read the textbook. But Lowi is hilarious but sometimes difficult to understand."
6645,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"One of the most chaotic classes I have ever taken. The professor does not care about the students whatsoever. He makes the students feel dumb if they answer a question wrong in class, and he never responds to his email. I had a personal issue where the professor essentially said too bad. Extremely rude and unprofessional."
6646,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Lee is a very caring professor, but can at times be scary. Don't be surprised if you or people around you start crying in the first few lectures, because the level of difficulty might take you off guard. You really need to pay attention to lectures in order to get an A in this class. This class was the worst grade I got first semester."
6647,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,3.0,4.0,"I had Stephen Lee his first time teaching 2080. I liked his style of bringing in a lot of practice problems, but the TA to student ratio made these extra sessions not very effective. Doctor Lee is very intense and honest, and made many students cry, most likely without meaning to. He did bring grades up though, so his methods do work."
6648,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,5.0,4.0,"I went from being so scared of chem in high school to actually being good at it now. If you genuinely get to know him, you'll realize that you'll never have a professor who cares for his students as much as Prof. Lee. All his TAs also work really hard to help you succeed and put in so much extra work in so you can get a good grade."
6649,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,5.0,5.0,"Stephen Lee is an amazing professor who truly cares about his students. Although he offers a ton of resources to succeed in this class, you must put in a lot of work to succeed. Curved to a B-."
6650,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,3.0,4.0,"Lots of work: lectures, pre/post-lecture HW, mandatory discussion, lab, ""optional"" 2-hour peer-led that's not really optional because lab quizzes and exams are based on it. AP chem doesn't help since Lee teaches stuff like physics/MO theory/particle-wave duality. Never used textbook. Fun demos in class. Can seem harsh at times but he truly cares!"
6651,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,3.0,4.0,He is an okay lecturer but not nearly all the material on the prelim is covered in lecture. There is no textbook reading so it can be hard to catch up if you don't understand something. He can be harsh in peer-led - tells people to erase their entire whiteboard or that they are gonna get a C on the prelim. He does care though I think. (Chem 2070)
6652,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,4.0,5.0,Great teacher - so many resources to do well. He goes a little fast In lectures but OH clears up a good amount of the confusion. The textbook is useless - don't buy
6653,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM2070,1.0,5.0,"When he taught my chem 2070 class, we didn't even touch the textbook once. And the lessons he gave were really weird. Let me tell you, I learned so much physics. Yes, physics in a chem class. He taught the right hand rule, the details of the photoelectric effect and particle wave duality and many more. He's a great teacher but follows his own ways."
6654,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,"Wasn't sure if I'd like him from the first few weeks of chem lots of yelling but after sticking it out, I have grown to love him. He genuinely cares about his students and is willing to do whatever for them to succeed. Dr. Lee has a very specific way he wants his students to do things but if you put in the effort to learn, it's worth it."
6655,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,"Took 1070 &amp; 1080 with him and he is genuinely my favorite professor here. Listen to him, he knows what he is talking about and he knows how to bridge high school thinking and college learning. It wont be easy and you will need a GROWTH MINDSET but take 2070 with him you will thank yourself later."
6656,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,"Took 1070 with Stephen and that was the only reason why I managed to get a decent grade in 2070. He genuinely cares about you and every single one of his students. If you follow everything he does and go through the hard problems he gives you, you will gain much better intuition. He is teaching 2070 next year- do take it with him!"
6657,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lee is by far the most caring lecturer I've had in all my years of learning. He makes every student work to their highest potential. He acknowledges that some students have gaps in their math skills and does everything in his power to repair these gaps and improve their critical thinking. Overall, he is a great man and an excellent professor."
6658,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,The best lecturer ever! Dr. Lee seems like the only professor on campus who actually wants you to succeed with the highest grade possible. He makes you work but hes hands down the best teacher Ive ever had.
6659,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1101,4.0,4.0,Can be challenging but really encourages critical thinking and really wants you to learn and understand the material. You wont regret having him!
6660,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1079,4.0,5.0,"Very challengeig but itll help you become a better critical thinker. Overall, he is very caring and want everyone to do well just expect it to be difficult."
6661,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,"DR LEE IS MY BOY. seriously the only professor on this campus you'll feel actually cares about you and your performance. he is all-knowing and he certainly has a ""my way or highway"" approach. but if you're riding in his car and place your trust in him, you'll certainly go where you want to."
6662,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,HE IS AMAZING. His father won a nobel prize and he definitely inherited his genius but chooses to teach mostly freshmen. General chemistry students learn how to critically think and problem solve on a much higher level than their peers. I got an A+ in CHEM 2070 and it is definitely because I put so much effort into Dr. Lee's class.
6663,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lee cares immensely about his students &amp; is incredibly intelligent. He expects a lot, but this type of diligence is what's needed to succeed in college &amp; especially in chem2070 where grading is based off other students' performances. Definitely recommend. You will learn tons of chemistry &amp; it'll put you ahead of the game in 2070."
6664,9789,Stephen,Lee,Cornell University,Science,CHEM1070,4.0,3.0,Love Dr. Lee! The only reason I even liked chemistry at all this semester and passed Chem 2070 with Woz was because of this genius. He is a very enthusiastic professor who really pushes you to grasp even the most difficult concepts.
6666,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,2.0,3.0,"Very, very passionate about chem, however the teaching is not great. Nice guy, funny at times, but confusing. If you have a very strong background and great interest in chem, some of his lectures will be very interesting. If not, they are confusing, boring, and not helpful for exams. The homework and textbook are necessary to get the material."
6667,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,3.0,"His lectures can be interesting to those of you who already took AP Chem and plan to become a Chemical or Biomedical engineer. Otherwise, they are not at all helpful. He does not teach what is tested on prelims. If you want to get an A in this class then you should really hit up the textbook when prelims come around. His demos are A++ though."
6668,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,3.0,3.0,"Very passionate and sort of funny, but lectures aren't very helpful if all you care about is getting the grade and fulfilling your requirement (although there is an attendance grade); instead of teaching the material you'll be tested on, he mostly talks about history, proofs, experiments, etc. I didn't use the textbook at all."
6669,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,5.0,3.0,Enthusiasm teacher! Nice person!!
6670,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,3.0,3.0,"Lectures are useless. Much of what is covered in class is unnecessary. However, random online questions for credit are posted often throughout the lectures so attendance is mandatory to get credit. If you are fine learning on your own by using the textbook/youtube, you will be fine. But having to go to lectures that do not help is annoying."
6671,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,3.0,"He's obviously very passionate about chemistry, but he's horrible at teaching it to students. His lectures are not helpful at all. They only confuse students more. The proofs he does are pointless and don't actually convey the material you need to know to do well on the prelims. Would recommend signing up for an AEW, you'll learn way more."
6672,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,4.0,"It's gen chem. You will not enjoy it unless you have prior experience, and he doesn't make it easier. Just read the textbook do the Sapling and practice exams and hope for the best. Learning proofs is useless unless you're THAT passionate about chem bruh."
6673,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,4.0,"He's very smart and enthusiastic about chemistry, but he gives his lectures under the assumption that you already understand the material. Instead of explaining any concepts, he just does proofs or works examples without explaining the general principles behind them. I stopped going to lecture and ended up learning everything through the textbook."
6674,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,5.0,"He's actually the worst teacher I've ever had. Showed up to lectures, took notes, and payed close attention to what Marohn was teaching. I ended up doing poorly on Prelim 1. Then, I stopped going to lecture/self-studied the course for the 50 minutes during lecture and ended up above the mean on Prelim 2. If you get him as a professor I am SO sorry."
6675,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,5.0,"To start, he's a nice guy but a terrible teacher. He teaches new stuff in a too complex manor such that you walk out of lecture learning nothing. He always says he'll assign a ""very short"" problem set, yet every time he says ""very short"" it ends up being the longest one we've done thus far, and keeps getting longer. The tests are impossible too."
6676,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2090,1.0,5.0,BAD
6677,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,2.0,4.0,"Great person with amazing enthusiasm and dedication. Unfortunately this does not translate into good lectures. If you read ahead of the lectures, you'll find them much more useful, but even then attendance likely won't help you solve many problems."
6678,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,2.0,3.0,Lectures were the most useless thing.  He just derives equations which has nothing to do with the tests and doesn't really help you learn chemistry.
6679,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,2.0,3.0,"Marohn makes concepts cryptic, whether it be in lecture or OHs. Labs are graded too harshly and take too much time. Passing the tests are manageable if you read the text; lectures are not necessary at all--they can confuse you more. I was considered ChemE, but after this class I (and about 75% of the class) changed their minds."
6680,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,2.0,4.0,"Marohn is a great guy and he obviously knows the material well, but he does not do a good job conveying this in lectures. The lectures were very sloppy and confusing, and the expectations for the course were extremely unclear. I pretty much learned the course material through the textbook."
6681,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,2.5,4.0,"Marohn is a very nice, friendly person. His enthusiasm for the subject is astounding. However, that enthusiasm doesn't translate well into lecturing and teaching an intro honors chem course. Spent way too much time deriving formulas in lecture. Lectures are hard to follow. If you want to pass DO THE HOMEWORK and really study it. Go to office hours"
6682,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,2150,2.5,4.0,"Marohn has good intentions, and some of his lectures are interesting. However, he spends far too much lecture time deriving formulas and ideas and nowhere near enough actually discussing the material. As such, to pass the class, I know many people that did not show up to lecture that did better than those that did. Do the homework and study it hard"
6683,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,3.0,4.0,"Marohn is obviously really interested in what he is teaching. He's very entertaining and fairly approachable. The problem is that he doesn't convey the material very well. His lectures could be very confusing and didn't reflect what appeared on the exams. Almost everything had to be learned from the textbook, which was pretty bad. A+ demos, though."
6684,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,3.0,3.0,"Professor Marohn holds office hours once almost every week but he takes forever and goes out of topic while solving a problem and there are tons of students asking him questions. Labs really are annoying (some of them will be like 8-9 pages). However, tests are curved really generously so if you do +1 SD the mean you will likely get A+ in the cours"
6685,265282,John,Marohn,Cornell University,Chemistry,2150,1.5,5.0,"Although he's enthusiastic about chemistry Prof. Marohn's lectures are completely useless as he unnecessarily derives formulas and lectures about topics that have nothing to do with what we need to know or what will be on the prelim. Everything I ""learned"" from this class was from the textbook. Overall, this class was a very bad experience."
6687,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,4.0,Easy class but she is one of the least sympathetic professors I've ever encountered. You could be in the hospital or be incredibly sick and she will still penalize you for an assignment not being handed in on time. No sense of humanity or understanding whatsoever. Easy material but merciless attitude makes the class awful. Avoid at all costs!
6688,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,3.0,Worst professor I've ever had! Her comments are not helpful at all. Didn't learn a thing in this course.
6689,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,3.0,1.0,"Super easy class. I didn't really learn much, but I guess I became more creative due to her in class exercises. Class had no exams, and was graded solely off two 2-page essays, online HWs, attendance and in-class exercises. Her lectures are somewhat engaging, but you can use them to do HWs for other classes if you need to. Would take again."
6690,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,4.0,"Super subjective grades, doesn't answer emails, horrible teacher with typos in all of her notes and grammatically incorrect sentences... How does she teach at this school"
6691,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,4.0,Very subjective grader and does not care about the students unless you are a male athlete. Accepts zero excuses for attendance and is not forgiving.
6692,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2420,1.0,3.0,"Debra Perosio is a terrible professor. I learned very basic concepts in her class and her grades are very disproportionately weighed. She also lacks sympathy - I missed class once and emailed her about it, never got a response, and got points deducted from my grade as a result. only take her class if you are forced to, as AEM majors are :)"
6693,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,1.0,I learned nothing and got an A+. Does that make sense? No. Am I happy? Yes.
6694,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,1.0,"VERY EASY CLASS. But because her lectures are so disorganized and unnecessary, only a quarter of the class shows up by mid-semester. You don't really learn anything at all. This class is very common sense. If you need a GPA booster take this class, but it's unfortunate how much  you don't learn from a class."
6695,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,1.0,Easy A but a very frustrating professor. Not very responsive. Does not corporate well with students. Doesn't even reply my questions with proper answers. Feels like talking to a 3rd grade student. Only take the course if you want an easy A but it is painful.
6696,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,3.0,"Horrible. Never take any of her classes unless you absolutely have to. Her lectures are partial summaries of textbook chapters. Assignments are 5 years old and are full of typos that make it hard to understand what phrases mean. She doesn't accept any feedback whatsoever. She doesn't seem to care about teaching at all. Once again, AVOID her classes"
6697,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,2.0,1.0,"Very disorganized lectures and course content. Very bad sense of humor and does not communicate with students respectfully. However, this was genuinely the easiest class I have taken at Cornell."
6698,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,5.0,2.0,She has changed the layout of the course:  papers and multiple quizzes. Perosio was wonderful to see 3 days a week and she genuinely cares about her students. Definitely would recommend this course. Easy to get an A. Quizzes based on textbook and lectures but taken on blackboard and can take with friends. The paper is 1 page. EASY AND FUN.
6699,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,3.0,This professor is the definition of a power trip. She does not care about any single student and will not accept anything late or have the compassion to help you if you have any personal problems. Take this course if you can turn things in on time and the credits but expect the most ambiguous quiz questions that will have no concrete answer.
6700,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,5.0,2.0,"It's important to pay attention during lecture since all the things that she tests are from her lecture slides. Her tests are EXTREMELY easy; many students get A+. There is a group project. I got randomly assigned to a team and a TA. Luckily my teammates were very cooperative, and my TA was amazing! Prof P will help all of her students to get an A."
6701,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,2.0,1.0,Here's how to be successful in this class. Skim the textbook chapter before lecture but don't waste actually reading it. Take notes during lecture!!! and write down examples. All the information in the course can boiled down to a bunch of lists and charts. These lists and charts will in form be on the prelims. Not a hard class but study.
6702,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,2420,1.5,5.0,"Unfair grading policies: peer evaluations throughout the semester that do not benefit your grade, yet not turning them in on time means a three point deduction from your final grade in the course! Her tests are very difficult and require no insight, only rote memorization, and most guest speakers brought in did not supplement learning."
6703,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,1.0,5.0,The class is very poorly organized. She doesn't post any notes and her online Friday's are a total waste of time. It's not an Ivy League level class. She doesn't really care about the class and the students.
6704,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,2400,1.0,1.0,"She's quite ignorant about her subject as can be seen at how awfully she answers questions. Every piece of material in this class is generic, common sense, or bs jargon. It's a shame that an ivy league's business school has such an ignorant marketing professor. She also made various factually incorrect statements about many international countries."
6705,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2400,2.0,2.0,"This is a review for Prof. P, not for AEM 2400. She is an OK lecturer, but can be shrilly and unfocused at times. She is extremely unprofessional- frequently failing to respond to emails, constantly making typos in both her exams and in lecture, and runs the class in a disorganized manner. The TA's were super unhelpful, don't bother with office hrs"
6706,195449,Debra,Perosio,Cornell University,Business,AEM2420,4.0,1.0,This was my first marketing experience and it really shocked me how easy it was. Professor P kept us on track and taught us how to be organized so overall it was an easy and rewarding experience if you paid attention and did your work.v
6707,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,2008535,1.0,5.0,Time for him to retire
6708,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,MSE410,1.0,5.0,worst professor ever...to be avoided...he spends so much time on ppt slides and we end up learning trivial stuff...exams are impossible...i have no clue what he says when he talks...weirdo who spends his life in his office
6709,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,MSE407,1.0,5.0,Worst professor EVER!
6710,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,MSE407,1.0,3.0,Very bogus professor..... he's so weird. He is definetly one of the most f-ed up professors at Cornell. He doesn't sleep.
6711,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,MSE407,1.0,5.0,"A crazy, creepy man. Girls: aviod him at all costs."

I don't have the time to get into how bad of a class this is, but just as a couple examples: we had 13 psets and FIVE of them were returned to us, tests were missing info we needed and one tested a problem that was on a homework NOT YET DUE. u won't do bad (curved to an A-), but not worth the frustration"
6718,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE336,1.0,5.0,He is definitly an ass
6719,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE336,2.5,5.0,"Course goes very very fast and covers just about every field of engineering, ECE, MSE, MechE, ChemE/chemistry, AEP/physics.  Don't take it if you're stupid.  Like me."
6720,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE336,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ast was a great professor! Once you got his oddball humor, very funny guy. Knew a lot, taught a lot, and everybody seemed to learn a lot."
6721,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE336,2.5,2.0,"The course was kind of fun for me, although most people disagree.  Ast can be unfriendly because he likes to point out other people's mistakes (I think).  He likes to say mmmkay a lot, and pauses a lot in lecture, giving us a short napping time, but he is funny in a weird way also."
6722,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE336,1.0,4.0,"Brilliant but can't teach at all.  Says mmmmmmmmmmmmmkay about 60 times/lecture.  Sounds like Mr. Mackey from South Park,  but with a harsh German accent"
6723,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE336,1.5,4.0,"Ast appears to be a brilliant man, but he sure as heck can't teach.  Lectures generally lacked a good 'flow' and homeworks were usually reduced to simple dimensional analysis or using formulas that you didn't understand.  Also, he's not very nice."
6724,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE336,4.0,5.0,"A very smart Professor, dedicated, but the course is very difficult. He assumes lots of knowledge from students' part. Tough in grading. Killer multiple choice exams... ""Exams without a calculator"" is what he called the 2nd prelims. Final all ca"
6725,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE536,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Went over some pretty tough material in this class which in the hands of a lesser professor would have made this class completely impossible. As it was, I found it as fun as something like this gets. Didnt help GPA, but will help in life"
6726,181331,Dieter,Ast,Cornell University,Engineering,ECE536,1.0,5.0,Horrible.
6728,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,3.0,5.0,"Very knowledgeable, but extremely tough course. If you are going into law, take this class. If not, you will learn a lot but put in an insane amount of time and effort. If I had the option to take a different professor, I would've because I don't want to go into law, but still glad I had this experience."
6729,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,PHI2604,4.0,2.0,Easy to relate with and very understanding
6730,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,5.0,5.0,"Yeah, Gold is the hardest professor in ILR for the most difficult course; however, he is one of the most knowledgable professors in the school. This class will not be easy, and will require a lot of work. If you take this class, I promise you will leave it a better student. Gold is unique!"
6731,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,5.0,5.0,"Gold is a gem. You will truly learn and get your money's worth. Everyone exaggerates over how hard this class is. If you put in the work, you will succeed."
6732,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,3.0,5.0,"Hardest class I have taken so much at ILR. The material was very dry and the pop quizzes are really difficult. Don't plan on sleeping because there are often 3+ readings due every class plus homework. Papers are graded very harshly. Gold starts every class off with a joke, but someone needs to tell him that he isn't funny."
6733,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,3.0,5.0,"Most difficult class I've ever taken in the ILR School. Labor Law took up at least 70% of my time this semester, with my other classes crammed into the other 30%. Because most of the cases are antiquated, they're a pain to read and understand. He distances himself from students and I felt intimidated to talk to him most of the semester."
6734,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,5.0,5.0,"If you value sleep, I wouldn't recommend this prof, but if you have any interest in law you have to take it with him.  Unbelievable amount of hard work, but it pays off in the end."
6735,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,5.0,4.0,"Professor Gold's class was not easy. But it was my favorite class at Cornell. You learn  a TON. He is inspiring and really dedicated to his students; I was assigned a group and we got along super well so it took some of the pressure off. He wrote my recommendation for law school and now I'm a labor and employment lawyer, if that tells you anything."
6736,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,1.5,4.0,"worst professor in ILR. Least clear assignments, but has very specific expectations. He doesn't realize that students have other classes besides his, and you will leave each class with no idea of what to do/how to apply the information from class.  Very smart man but awful instructor. Avoid his class at all costs."
6737,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,3.5,4.0,"if you want to go to law school this is life affirming. otherwise, get a different professor for labor law.  I spent all my time on this class and got an 80% which curved  to an A. Lots of group work but you can't choose your group which sucks sometimes. The Law school TA is SUPER HELPFUL, you'll learn a ton about labor law/your writing. MeanB+"
6738,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Gold is great. His class had  a reputation for being hard as hell, but it really isn't all that bad. There is a lot of required reading and pop quizzes just about every class. Most of the homework is group work. Don't worry about his tough grading;  I had a 45% raw score at the end of the semester that got curved to a B. Learned a TON."
6739,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,2060,3.5,4.0,"For Ethics at Work (sophomore writing seminar), he values more quality than quantity. You don't write that much, but you need to summarize complicated philosophical concepts and theories in 2 pages. Take notes; they help a little. Reading helps a little. Office hours help more. "
6740,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILR2010,2.5,4.0,"If you take this class, make sure your footnotes are on the correct side of the period at the end of the sentence--I had 1% taken of my final paper for each incorrectly placed footnote (about 34 in all). If thats the kind of class you like, then go for it. If its not, then you will regret taking it and you probably wont get above a B-."
6741,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,2060,2.5,3.0,"Professor Gold is the professor who lets you challenge him and doesn't dismiss your ideas when they're different.  My class with Professor Gold is the highlight of my semester. His comments on your papers are longer than the papers themselves; I learn so much about my writing style, my strengths, and my weaknesses. It's  such a pleasure."
6742,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,2010,4.0,3.0,"His Labor Law course is by far my favorite class. While the work is extensive it is all extremely relevant to the lectures. He starts off each class with a joke or a funny story. He also asks if there are any questions from the previous lecture. In the end, the curve will help you a ton so don't freak about the low grades throughout the semester."
6743,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,4.5,5.0,"Gold is incredibly intense and intimidating &amp; labor law is undeniably demanding. But he is a fascinating lecturer, a fair teacher, and incredibly knowledgeable. The workload is very heavy but classmates bond over essays &amp; seemingly impossible assignments. The difficulty is worth it; I learned so much in this class. Attendance- basically mandatory."
6744,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRLR2010,3.5,5.0,"Probably the most demanding professor at Cornell and the teacher of ILR's most demanding class. He's incredibly smart and experienced.  You will learn TONS about labor law (and time management). Workload is insane, but his lectures and your knowledge at the end of the course make up for it. 2010 is great for bonding with others over lack of sleep."
6745,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRCB2010,5.0,4.0,"Professor Gold's course has been by far the best course I have ever taken at Cornell University.  He is a very fair professor which views students as equals, no matter their backgrounds, and challenges every student in the same manner.  I highly recommend this course."
6746,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRCB2010,5.0,4.0,"he is a great guy and amazing teacher. don't be scared to take his class. there's work, but it's definitely worth it in the end."
6747,85387,Michael,Gold,Cornell University,Law,ILRCB2010,5.0,5.0,"The material is not easy for sure. Luckily, Professor Gold makes it interesting and he is fair."
6748,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2801,5.0,5.0,"You will get yelled at and might get hit by Nero, but keep asking questions and don't give up. She's definitely there to help you but you need to put in the other half of the work. She'll push you and is not afraid of whacking you on the head to get you to learn."
6749,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2801,1.0,5.0,"Not a nice person. I honestly believe she enjoys handing out low grades just because this university doesn't care. If you don't need to take this class but you still enroll, your parents should have sent you to a mental hospital instead of Cornell."
6750,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,1.0,5.0,"Nero was the worst professor that I have ever had. The genetics course was neither well -organized nor well paced.  The tests were beyond what had been presented in class, and the hw was impossible. This is the only class where 0/100 is a possible exam grade (with studying). Nero curses people during OH and  leaves them feeling confused and stupid."
6751,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2801,4.5,4.0,"Debbie isn't the softest of people, but she cares if you do. If you are intimidated by her style, try scheduling a one-on-one meeting with her. She will push you to understand. The only warning I have is that her normal speaking voice outside of her office is approximately lecture-hall enunciation. Don't pick your friends as lab partners, really."
6752,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2801,4.0,5.0,"Dr. Nero is the most ""unconventional"" teacher I've had, to put it mildly. I must admit, her explanations are exceptionally clear, as long as you can filter the genetics from the cursing. Lab is a time-guzzling course, and there's atrocious communication between the TAs and students. It's very unclear what they want. You must go to office hours."
6753,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Nero is extremely intimidating and her last name equates her to the terrors of the same Roman Emperor.  She is extremely abrasive and old-fashioned, which some people like, and others do not.  She wants you to understand the material, and if you show appreciation for her and her subject, she will take a direct interest in you!! "
6754,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,3.5,5.0,The lab takes up a lot of time and she is hard grader. Other than that she is very helpful and knows her stuff very well.
6755,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2801,5.0,5.0,"Cornell is the heart of classic genetics. This is the bread and butter course for the discipline. It shouldn't be easy and it isn't. Nero will help you, but she won't drag you around like a puppy. You have to work for it like an adult, if you do that, she'll show you the way to success. Go to every office hour and lecture you can. Good luck!"
6756,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,1.0,5.0,She is awful
6757,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2801,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Nero is the best. Very helpful and is an incredible professor. Might seem intimidating at first, but if you're lucky enough to get to know her, she is an incredibly sweet lady. She made genetics understandable and fun."
6758,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2801,4.0,4.0,Nero manage to teach with clarity despite teaching a difficult subject. She can be intimidating esp with her loud voice but she's really trying to help you. Don't feel intimidated and ask questions bc she's your best resource.
6759,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOG2810,2.0,5.0,a lot of screaming involved in the early morning. her problem solving is a must if you want to do well in genetics. lab is hands down the worst class i've taken at cornell
6760,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,5.0,VERY helpful if you just ignore the fact that she's yelling
6761,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,4.0,Intimidating during problem solving sessions but quite approachable during one-on-one interactions. Knows the problems cold and can offer clear and succinct explanations of any problem in the textbook/lab/prelims
6762,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,4.0,"You'll either hate or love Nero-- she keeps you awake at 8am. Her PS sessions are gold if you want to do well in the class, and she'll jump through hoops to help you (it's just that her delivery needs work). Labs will suck away your time and are hard, but if you go to office hours every week (yeah, EVERY week) you'll do really well."
6763,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,3.0,Probably the best teacher I've had at Cornell. Made me remember and truly learn the material.
6764,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOG2810,5.0,4.0,"She can be intimidating at first because of the screaming, but once you get past that she's great. Go to her problem solving sessions if you want to do well in genetics."
6765,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,5.0,"You will either immediately hate or love Dr. Nero, she has a big personality: her main form of communication is screaming and she cusses like a sailor, all this aside, she is an excellent professor, problem solving is good for understanding concepts but not necessary to do well in the course (that is based on pure luck). This course will be hell!"
6766,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,4.0,"Her class is like a soccer game: you can't cram study the night before and expect to do well. Practice, book problems and problem solving!! Nero's as sharp as a tack and an understanding of the material that's backwards and forwards. GO TO OFFICE HOURS AND PROBLEM SOLVING. She's exceptionally willing to help!"
6767,162717,Debra,Nero,Cornell University,Science,BIOGD281,1.0,5.0,"As a personal rule, I don't respect anyone that doesn't respect me and HATE Dr. Nero. All the worst qualities of professor rolled into one. Students that like her must be masochistic, or unaware of the respect they deserve as human beings."
6769,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2190,5.0,3.0,"A very respectable and respectful professor who genuinely cares about his students. His care takes the form of wanting the best for the student, which doesn't translate into lax standards in any way. Excellent explanations. Office hours are incredibly valuable."
6770,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2190,5.0,2.0,"While homework groups were annoying at times, they weren't terrible. All exams (3 prelims+final) were completely fair and if you took good notes in lecture and really understood homework and section problems, they were straight forward. Don't slack because it seems easier than PChem. Advice, do all problems yourself before exam so YOU actually know"
6771,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,CHEME1120,5.0,4.0,"Not the easiest intro course, but probably the most useful. Anyone with the slightest inclination toward pursuing ChemE should take the course."
6772,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1120,5.0,4.0,"TMD is the man! He lets you know from the start that it is not a normal intro class in the fact that you must work hard and you learn, but if you stick through it you gain a whole new perspective on your chosen major. It does stink that he wrote the textbook because lectures can seem repetitive, but he is very personable and helpful in office hours"
6773,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1120,3.0,4.0,"He's an odd teacher - doesn't really teach to the style of the students, despite the fact that he says otherwise. Heavy emphasis on the textbook. Really smart guy though, but didn't seem connected to any of the students but his favorites."
6774,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1112,5.0,3.0,"He is best professor I have ever met. He always make everything clear and his class is well organized. Although it is not an easy class to get good grades, you can learn a lot in his class, not only engineering knowledge, but the attitude towards life, critical thinking and communication skills."
6775,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,CHEME1112,5.0,4.0,"Professor Duncan changed my interest from ""What is chemical engineering?"" to ""This is the coolest stuff ever!"""

6777,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,CHEME3900,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic course teacher.  Poor advisor.  Condescending if you are not confident or if you do not agree with him.  This is college; kids are supposed to find themselves, not be discouraged. His favorites get more confident while the shy ones get more shy.  This is an unfair and unstable method to students."
6778,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,CHEM391,3.0,4.0,"In a perfect situation Duncan would be a great teacher. He interacts with the class, seems friendly and is very intelligent.  But the reality is, he takes things personally, a very bad characteristic for someone in a position to educate.  Once he aligns himself against you, consider avoiding him at all costs and not depending on him for help."
6779,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,CHEME390,4.0,3.0,He intimidates me ... oh TMD
6780,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,MATH1920,4.5,4.0,"I had him for multivariable calc and he was a great teacher. He was out of his subject matter and he did an excellent job of teaching the material. He was clear, comprehensive, and loved to interact with the class."
6781,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI112,1.5,5.0,He's definitely someone who picks favorites. But watch out if he doesn't like you. He'll make your life miserable.
6782,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI112,4.0,2.0,"This is a very rigorous introduction to chemical engineering. It is not an easy class, but you will learn a lot if you put your earnest effort to it. A lot of skills are honed in this class. For instance, interpreting graphs, guessimating, etc. It is a critical thinking class, and this is how the professor wanted it to be."
6783,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI112,1.0,5.0,"Avoid this class at all means possible.  It requires much more work than an intro class and more time consuming than 3 credits should be. If you are thinking of being a chemical engineering, you will really rethink it after this class."
6784,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI112,4.5,5.0,"First time a teacher actually knew my name and cares how i was doing. Duncan is by far the best teacher I've had at Cornell (he was named teacher of the year in NY for 2007!) If you take this class, beware, he knows your name and whether or not you care to show up or try hard"

6786,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI112,4.5,3.0,The best teacher that I have had so far.  He really knows what he is teaching and has a good sense of humor.  Excellent use of chalk and TAs.
6787,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENG112,3.0,5.0,"He really knows his stuff, but taking notes in class is really hard because of the handouts.  Its impossible to study from the notes in class, and the text isnt much help. Best way to study is do the practice problems on the website. Office hours were overcrowded and the TA's didnt have enough time to be particularly helpful to anyone."
6788,9787,T. Michael,Duncan,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI112,4.5,5.0,Great Professor in terms of knowing the material and getting it through to the students. Intro to cheme class will give you a good idea of wether chemical engineering is what you want.
6790,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Boucher was honestly one of the best professors I've had in Cornell. He was always very enthusiastic about his work and he made sure all of the concepts taught in the class were thoroughly discussed. For this class, just make sure you do the readings and you reach out when you are confused about anything!"
6791,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,1.0,5.0,Take someone else. This guy doesnt care about teaching and he isnt helpful inside or outside of class. Your grade will depend on your TA but they have a tendency of kisses the professors behind. So glad this class is over with

6793,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,1.0,3.0,"I guess your grade will mostly depend on the TA. In my case, I didn't have much assistance and so I just over studied to make up for the lack of guidance. The prof isnt helpful so expect doing much more than you signed up for. He took interesting subjects and some how managed to make them dreadful. The rules to grading change to stay pay attention."

6795,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,1.0,5.0,"Perhaps the virus brought out his dark side. Boucher is bar none the worst prof at Cornell. Zoom Lectures are a quick 2-5 minute long recap of old Asian text, and then there is a huge disconnect between the fake on the hw he assigns. He is angry and going to office hours is just demeaning, you ask for help he rubs it in you."
6796,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASAIN2250,1.0,4.0,"While the prof knows his subject matter really well, he could care less about students. His lectures are a fast paced 50 min throw up of info.. and then he bolts out. He is vindictive and sets the tone for his TAs to do the same. They treat this like a higher level English class and seem to get an enjoyment taking off points for the dumbest things."
6797,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,3.0,2.0,"The professor takes a topic that has a lot of potential to be fascinating but makes it somewhat dry, he's just talking at you for 50 minutes without usually incorporating videos or pictures. He's very passionate though and if you take good notes the quizzes are easy, and you don't really have to do readings."
6798,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN127,5.0,1.0,Though stern he gives very clear lectures and unlike other reviews he was always there to offer extra office hours and talk to people outside of class. He is very straightforward in his grading which made it difficult to mess up. He really makes it easy and my TA was a gem as well. Just go to lecture and he explains everything for essays and quizs
6799,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,3.0,3.0,"The professor is definitely passionate about the material, but he can come off as abrasive/irreverent during lectures (which are completely technology-free by the way--no powerpoints). Weekly assignments, a couple easy quizzes, and two big papers. As far as stress/workload, nbd. But I left with less enthusiasm for the subject than I came in with."
6800,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,4.0,1.0,"If you do the homeworks (which are easy) and go to class, you'll get an A+"
6801,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,5.0,1.0,"If you are at all interested in the subject matter, you should find the readings and lectures very worthwhile. I especially enjoyed that he picked a lot of colorful and engaging primary sources rather than dry commentary. This class gives an excellent survey of religion in Asia and provides a good foundation for future investigation."
6802,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,2.5,4.0,"Quiz preparation is vague, unhelpful feedback on papers and discussion responses, hardest class of my semester and it was not even for my major!"
6803,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher! He's very passionate about the subject matter and explains it very well. He does speak very quickly so it can be hard to get all the notes, but he is extremely helpful and will answer any of your questions after class. If you ever need help on a paper, go to his office hours!"
6804,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN250,5.0,3.0,"The class was easy; a couple simple quizzes and two papers. He is a great lecturer, although he does talk really fast, and always answers questions and even goes over old material before each lecture in case you weren't there."
6805,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN2250,4.5,3.0,"A great lecturer and a ridiculously interesting topic. Lectures aren't mandatory but you won't want to miss any of them. He is a very clear speaker and really holds your attention. One page paper due every week, three quizzes and two papers. A pretty easy class but he speaks very quickly, get a digital recorder so you don't miss what he says!"
6806,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN250,5.0,1.0,"I thought he was a really good lecturer.  Despite just talking for an hour with no slides, I rarely found my attention wander.  The readings seemed appropriate in content and length.  Overall pretty easy with a weekly response that takes no time at all and occasional quizzes.  Quite approachable."
6807,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN354,2.0,3.0,"Boucher is quite a disturbed individual. He says things without thinking and tends to blurt out things that are completely disrespectful and  out of bounds. Overall, he is a rude person. I really do not know how he received tenure (hasn't published a book yet and most students try to avoid him).  It is a shame, actually."
6808,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN127,4.5,4.0,"While this class was interesting, it was hard to write papers on the subject because we had only been exposed to the topic for a few months."
6809,134355,Daniel,Boucher,Cornell University,Theology,ASIAN127,2.0,5.0,Very tough and sometimes very boring when he lectures. His material is usually complicated and hard to understand. He IS very nice and helpful if you approach him. You have to go to office hours and he will help you.
6811,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE4710,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Ruina is hands-down the best professor I've had at Cornell. He's so incredibly accommodating (this is review is being written during the coronavirus pandemic, btw) and he really cares that his students LEARN. His lectures are very interesting and you can tell he genuinely enjoys the material he teaches. Cannot recommend him enough."
6812,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2030,4.0,4.0,"Decent professor. Difficult class overall. He is very knowledgeable about Dynamics, though sometimes goes into extreme detail. You will need to work extremely hard for a good grade."
6813,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRG1112,5.0,4.0,"Every MATLAB script I have written has benefited tremendously from lessons and examples provided in class and in our textbook. On top of his superb hands-on style, Professor Ruina is one of the most understanding, accommodative teachers Ive ever had, and he gave me invaluable help in a time of need. I cant recommend him highly enough."
6814,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2030,1.0,4.0,I have never been more offended by a professor than with my interactions with Professor Ruina. My recommendation to him is to treat his students with more respect; people are more than their work. You can ask hard questions and challenge students without being rude.
6815,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE5730,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Ruina is a great professor!  I have had 2 course with him and in both his lectures were clear, digestible and forced you to think.  He holds LOTS of office hours. You do have to work in his courses but that's engineering - doing lots of problems. If you are a delicate flower then you will be offended by him. But he cares about students."
6816,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE6700,4.5,4.0,"I like Professor Ruina so much! I took three courses( Intermediate dynamics and vibraion, Dynamics of Flight and Advanced Dynamics)from him and did two projects with him. It is a pleasure and even honor to work with him. He is the reason why I am pursing my Ph.D. research in dynamic walking and robotics. To me, he is a mentor, more than just a prof"
6817,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2030,5.0,4.0,"Ruina knows the subject matter in and out, really encourages asking questions,  engages active strategies to encourage understanding and class participation, and is always trying to improve. However you will work for your grade, and his attitude tends towards tough-love. If you are okay with that, you will enjoy his classes. "
6818,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2030,1.0,5.0,Worst Professor ever! He may be smart but his personality and teaching style makes many many students dislike him. I don't know why there are positive reviews unless they share his affinity for disrespecting other people.
6819,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE5730,4.5,2.0,"I really like Professor Andy Ruina. Compared to other professors, Andy did a very good job in teaching. His way of grading students is really good. Everyone could get a better grade in his class. "
6820,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2030,4.5,3.0,"Excellent lecturer. Lectures are very well organized, clear and concise. He even has a systematic way of erasing the blackboard during lectures. He's smart and knows the material he's teaching very well. However, his textbook is really bad. I liked him and his teaching style but frankly, I didn't really learn much from his textbook."
6821,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM2020,5.0,3.0,"Ruina is the reason why I chose mechanical engineering. His teaching style is clear and concise, makes the material very approachable and interesting. I've heard in the past he wasn't so great, but it's clear he has perfected his teaching style since then. He is my favorite professor from my college experience."
6822,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM2020,4.0,1.0,Entertaining and Helpful
6823,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM2020,5.0,5.0,Very fatherly. Ruina embodies the spirit of tough love.
6824,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM2030,3.5,4.0,"Although the material is difficult, I feel as though Ruina's lectures are well-organized. He drops your lowest exam and homework grades, and I feel as though he's not trying to fail us. The emphasis on MATLAB is very strong (which I personally don't like), but it seems as though this might be useful in the future."
6825,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.0,4.0,"Ruina is probably one of the smartest guys I ever met and he definitely tries to help students (ie exam problem redos, dropping lowest grades, etc.). However, despite his good intentions a few things backfire (ie exam redos result in simply a higher mean with smaller deviations). I hated how he used a textbook he wrote that just echoed his lecture."
6826,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.0,3.0,"Textbook is not useful at all.  Lectures are fast and confusing, it almost seems as if he tries to confuse you on purpose.  It was hard for me to understand, esp since the textbook was so poor.  He def tries to be helpful though, and drops the lowest homeworks and prelim probs."
6827,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM2030,1.5,4.0,"People respond to Prof. Ruina in one of two ways, they either love him or hate him, which is evidenced given his middle score rating. My experience is that he lectures to the top portion of the class. That being said, the course is hard. If you have to have him as a teacher, then be prepared to do alot of work with the TAs and ask alot of questions"
6828,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM570,5.0,3.0,"He is perhaps the smartest guy I met. He is a very good lecturer, especially if you are interested in understanding a subject deeply. Pay attention to everything he says in class, and try to figure it out if you do not quite understand it -- you will be rewarded."
6829,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM2030,2.5,3.0,"I thought he was a decent teacher, though it's ridiculous that we had to buy his crazy expensive book...of which we only used half (the first half was statics). He seems to know his stuff...but I have trouble getting past how much he likes himself. He thinks he's really funny, and so even when his jokes are okay I don't want to laugh."
6830,9721,Andrew,Ruina,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM203,1.0,5.0,"This guy is awful. problem sets are impossibly weird, TAs never know the answers, half the time there are no answers. why should we have to live with matlab&amp;him 24/7 anyways ???"
6831,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100,4.0,3.0,"I truly enjoyed this class. I'm not sure the lectures were terribly useful (are they ever?), but I kept going to class anyway because this guy is geeky and hilarious, and his love of what he does is infectious. I didn't think it was that hard, but CS100 is a weed out class so some people will find it way too hard."
6832,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS211,1.0,5.0,"the subject matter of this class should be interesting (and is, when you just do it on your own), but his lectures are completely useless. I would say he's one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He seems like a nice man though."
6833,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,COMS212,3.5,1.0,"Great guy- head of the game design initiative. Gives you many opportunities to study different things in his class, and you learn a lot about many aspects of computer science. He's totally random, so if you're the kind of uptight student that can't stand professors having fun with the material and class, you wont like it(see reviews below)"
6834,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,COMS212,3.5,4.0,"helpful, nice guy. cs 212 is pretty hard tho. the key is to have a reliable partner."
6835,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,COMS212,1.0,4.0,"COMS212 is far too hard for a 1 credit class; furthermore, shwartz made it even harder even after many complaints of the difficulty.  This class used to have less work and be 2 credits.  Also, he may be a nice person - but beware the lectures; they're just about impossible to follow unless you already reasonably know the material from elsewhere."
6836,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100M,1.0,4.0,I'd rather castrate myself with a rusty spoon than sit through another one of this man's lectures.  He spastic teaching methods are completely and utterly unhelpful.
6837,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS212,5.0,3.0,great professor.  organized lectures and clear lecture notes.  very interesting way of teaching and nerdly humorous.  overall i learned a lot in his class.
6838,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100M,1.0,5.0,his random grading policy screwed me over in the end...
6840,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS211,1.0,4.0,This man is the devil
6841,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100M,5.0,2.0,"Schwartzie was an AWESOME professor. He makes sure everyone gets the subject matter, and that makes him a good man in my book. He's funny and nerdy and great! He recognizes that learning to program is learning a new convoluted language where everything is an order instead of a statement."
6842,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS211,1.0,4.0,"This was the worst class I've taken here at Cornell. This guy is absolutely terrible. He does seem like a nice guy and all, but his class was unbelievably boring and badly taught."
6843,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100M,4.5,4.0,"The biggest nerd ever, but funny, and very good at what he does.  However, the course staff is terrible, the TAs are ok, but the counsultents (the people who grade stuff) are the worst, they are so arbitrey in grading, so beware for **** consultents."
6844,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS212,5.0,3.0,"This man is god. He is like a uber nerd, but he knows his stuff. You have have what it takes to learn, and you do need to be smart, you will really love his classes. If you are dumb, you are screwed. Sorry, this is NOT an easy A."
6845,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100M,3.0,3.0,meh! I think that explains it all.
6847,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100M,3.5,1.0,"He posts really detailed notes online which helped more than lecture itself, so I stopped going to lecture. I understood what was going on, and he was really wacky, lots of corny jokes. Kept me awake at 9:05. Warning: assignments can be long &amp;complicated."
6848,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS100M,4.0,3.0,"Unarguably the geekiest man alive, yet his silly laugh and his terribly corny jokes always put me in a good mood.  He does an excellent job of keeping the people with no programming experience on the same page as those with experience."
6849,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS211,2.5,4.0,"CS 211 was not a well managed course, but Schwartz can't be entirely blamed.  It's tough to find a balance between boring the master hackers and dizzying those who have never seen Java before.  He got better at explaining ideas as the semester went on."
6850,56605,David,Schwartz,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS211,1.0,4.0,"Schwartz is so obnoxious. Grading is arbitrary, assignments are stupid, his examples are extremely unclear."
6851,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,4.5,3.0,The difficulty is progressive. The final outcome is impressive. ANSYS and MATLAB in the pocket.
6852,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,5.0,5.0,Really good professor. One of the only classes that will remind you that you are at Cornell University!!! It's a lot of work but its really worth it. Every single engineer should take this class!
6853,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,3.5,4.0,great
6854,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,3.5,5.0,"One of the hardest classes I took at Cornell. That said, by far the most useful, and applicable to my life as an engineer. FEA is really worth understanding."
6855,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,5.0,3.0,Intense course. Homework is not easy but extremely helpful. Lectures are really good.
6856,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,4.5,4.0,"Difficult course but you can succeed;attend lecture, study the lecture notes, and attend office hours. The professor was a good lecturer who wrote clear, thorough notes. This course is a great resume enhancer because of its applicability to industry. It also gives solid theoretical understanding and the professor is very willing to be a reference."
6857,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,1.5,5.0,"Lecture was disorganized, usually unclear, and he taught only the hardest parts of the material in class, requiring studying through the lecture slides to learn the rest. Group homeworks were exceptionally hard, and frequently not helpful. First exam was brutal, second was OK. Final project was a lot of work, though leniently graded."
6858,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,2.5,4.0,"A professor who's only interest is productivity. Α successful teacher, but a failed educator and leader. Students are not slaves, but critical spirits.."
6859,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,5.0,5.0,"During a recent interview, I was asked questions related to FEM/FEA and I was able to draw my answers directly from this course. The interviewers literally started taking me much more seriously after I explained some of these things in detail. I've never been as challenged as I was in this course, but it has paid off greatly."
6860,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,5.0,4.0,"The course gives an all-around perception of the finite element method. The methods are basic in FEM but they are of great importance in the further study. The Professor gives excellent presentations by introducing the most core things in limited time. It's the most impressive course I've taken. Though I didn't master everything, I learned a lot!"
6861,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,2.5,5.0,One of the hardest classes for an undergraduate. His comments are all caustic &amp; sarcastic which over an extent makes you feel sick &amp; dizzy! He is good at teaching but sitting in class can be painful because of his comments. His TA's just cannot speak English - it sucks!
6862,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,3.5,3.0,"This class was the most valuable class I've taken for my Master's degree. The material was complex, but explained well. Zabaras had thorough slides and the material was hard at times but possible to understand. I really don't think my education would be complete without this class. It's so valuable!!!"
6863,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,3.0,3.0,Useful class for Graduate students.
6864,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,3.0,5.0,"If you don't like somebody, send him to this class. Terrible!"
6865,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,5.0,3.0,"Studying FEM was an experience. It was not easy for sure, but I believe it is going to repay big time later. I like the way the entire program is structured...its fundamental!!"
6866,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,4.0,5.0,"Interesting material. Professor Zabaras is one of the smartest and funniest professors I have had at Cornell. Lectures are enjoyable. Do NOT take this class if you do not plan to work very hard, but if you are looking to actually learn the material, this is THE class to take."
6867,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,3.5,5.0,definitely one of my hardest classes at cornell. many hours spent and near-allnighters pulled. useful class though. the subject is really good.
6868,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,4.0,5.0,"This was the hardest course I have taken at Cornell.  Zabaras expects hard work and genuine quality work. He has high expectations, but he is fair."
6869,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE5700,3.5,4.0,"The course was fun, lots of sleepless nights, tough mathematical slides but you get a hang of them in the end. Assignments got us all crazy &amp; exams were not so bad! He is extremely intelligent &amp; expects his class to perform &amp; apply common sense!"
6870,187591,Nicholas,Zabaras,Cornell University,Aerospace Eng. &amp; Mechanics,MAE4700,4.0,5.0,"Extremely difficult class, but if you put enough effort and time into it, it can be very rewarding. The lectures can be both impossibly confusing and extremely interesting, and I've been on both ends of the spectrum in this class. Pay attention, go to office hours, and put a lot of effort in, and it will be worth your while."
6871,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILR1100,2.5,4.0,"Amazing man, super interesting and kind if you get to know him. That being said, the essay questions are broad and vague and the grading is extremely harsh. A LOT of reading. "
6872,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1100,1.0,4.0,"Salvatore is a very nice, intelligent, and interesting professor. However, his lectures are gruelingly long and boring. He gives vague essay prompts and grades moderately difficult. I did not come out of the class feeling as though I learned a whole lot."
6873,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1100,3.5,4.0,"Old school professor who thinks a B is a great grade. A very nice person and very willing to help if you seek him out and approach him during office hours. However, he is a tough grader and getting an A is next to impossible in his class."
6874,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLR,1.0,5.0,"Quite possibly the worst history teacher I have ever encountered in my life. His essays prompts are hilariously vague, he grades all tests without any sense. All of his assigned readings push the leftist agenda.  DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU WANT ANY CONTROL OVER YOUR GPA because no matter how well you know the material its all a coin toss."
6875,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1100,1.5,3.0,"He is pushing the left agenda consistently, and I know this is the ILR and all, but it is ridiculous. He attributes the Great Depression to ""Corporate Shenanigans"". His lectures often showcase his growing senility, and tend to have little correlation to our readings."
6876,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILR3860,5.0,4.0,"Salvatore is the best. His lectures are not boring, any lecture can be long when its 75 min. You have to go in to o.h. and pick his brain because he is incredibly warm, intelligent and helpful. His class is challenging but more than rewarding and informative. he really opens your eyes, don't miss out on his class!"
6877,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLR3860,2.0,5.0,"I'll say it like how it is. He knows what he's talking about, but lectures incredibly boring. Takes interesting topic then makes it so boring you'll have more fun strangling yourself with a cordless phone. Barely any class discuss.Gives out bad grades for what purpose? Essay comments vague, unhelpful, and handwriting incomprehensible.A bad teacher."
6878,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLR3042,3.5,5.0,"The man is obviously smart ,but he teaches at Cornell so this is expected and should not the a reason to take his classes. Grades too harshly, especially for an ILR class! Grades unfairly. Folks receiving the same grade on exams/essays as me got higher grades bc they went to office hours and acted ""engaged."" Headache outweighs the nice guy factor."
6879,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1100,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors you can get at Cornell.  To be honest he is not the easiest grader, but if you take a class with him you will learn a lot about history, as well as how to really read which helps in most of your other classes"
6880,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLH1100,3.5,4.0,"I tried desperately to switch out of him because I heard he was ""C- Salvatore"" and I am so glad I didn't! His class was like story time and he gets kind of emotional. Really cares about his students! I thought I BOMBED every test I took and you end up doing better than you think! Readings are interesting"
6881,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,HIST3,2.0,5.0,"His essay topics are rambling and unclear, which of course gives him lots of leeway to take of points. Previous comments call him brilliant, and that he may be, but (unless you want a PHD in the topic) the costs of having him greatly outweigh the benefits"
6882,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRLH3860,4.5,4.0,"Extremely knowledgeable about topics and always willing to help. Take the time to talk to him outside of class. Relaxed discussions about class topics really helped me understand them further and helped me build one of the best relationships with a professor I've ever had. Tough grader yes, but work hard, show that you care, and you will get an A."
6883,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRCB3042,3.5,4.0,"Don't miss out on his teaching because you are afraid of GPA damage - As are entirely possible if you put some effort into it. He's straight-up brilliant, which sometimes means he's hard to follow. However, he's completely worth the potential confusion and scathing comments on your papers. Love him."
6884,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,AMST1240,3.0,4.0,Great person. Knows his stuff extremely well.  Assembles interesting conversations after class. RECOMMENDED!!!
6885,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILR1100,4.5,4.0,"Lectures were boring, but if you can manage to stay awake and listen, you would realize that his lectures are really clear and logical. You would also realize that he is a brilliant man."
6886,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRCB1100,2.0,5.0,Good luck
6887,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,ILRCB304,1.5,5.0,Prof. Salvatore is self-righteous and full of himself. He likes to tear papers to shreads and then provides few useful suggestions on how to improve one's writing. Huge powertrip.
6888,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,HIST374,3.5,4.0,"Tough grader, but lectures provided most of the information for the tests."
6889,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,IRLCB100,1.5,4.0,this is the most mind-numbing lecture ever devised. do the reading (there's a lot) and the essay/prelim/final should go alright. i never found attending worth it because the lectures were seemingly repetative and unconnected.
6890,43983,Nick,Salvatore,Cornell University,History,HIST,2.0,5.0,Sometimes cried in class during gospel songs
6892,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,5.0,4.0,"Professor Avery is approachable and knowledgable! The class is a lot of work, but manageable. Prelims are memorization and she does look for specific wording in the answers. Lectures are interesting and make you think. She tests readings heavily and they've been cut down, so take notes while you read! GPP groups are hit or miss. TAs are amazing!"
6893,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,4.0,3.0,"She loves what she does, is a strong lecturer, and obviously cares about her students. The course itself has a LOT of information (most of it in lecture) but as long as you go to class and pay attention/take notes, you'll be fine for the tests. Grading is also fair/easy."
6894,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,5.0,4.0,"There is a difference between hard &amp; unfair. Avery's class is hard- intense, but rewarding. Prelims and papers require devoted studying but concepts are crucial for future coursework. She provides multiple office hours and extra credit. She cares so much for her class and students- she memorizes every students' name. 2300 affirmed why I chose PAM."
6895,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,5.0,4.0,"Prof Avery is fantastic! She really cares about her students and is a good lecturer. Her course does involve a lot of studying and essay writing, but it is 4 credits and most people end up with an A or B. TAs are very involved, the class is interesting and focuses on current events, and is overall a great intro to the PAM major."
6896,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,1.0,3.0,gpa is based on socializing skills. tons of hw.
6897,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,1.0,5.0,All of the comments below are true.
6898,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,2.0,5.0,The prelims for PAM 2300 or pure memorization and the class is simply a ton of work. Prelims combined with the policy papers take up an enormous amount of time.
6899,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,1.0,5.0,"Professor Avery goes too fast through the slides, doesn't leave time for questions, gives Herculean projects, the tests are memorization of material you'll never use again or could look up easily, and the TA's form a cult of personality around her. Avoid this class if you can."
6900,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,1.0,5.0,"This class was not fun. I am definitely switching majors next semester. I don't like the way this class is run, really encourages students to kiss up to her to try to be come a ta or research assistant. Feels more connection based than merit. Most of the content from lectures was useless. she made a point to take attendance after a break or project"
6901,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,1.0,5.0,"She's nice, but her class is the worst I've ever taken. Material isn't difficult at all, but there's an obscene amount of memorization. Prelims are killerher questions are poorly worded &amp; ambiguous and you get points off for not phrasing things exactly how she wants, and for not including things she didn't even ask for. 0/10 wouldn't recommend."
6902,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,2.0,4.0,"The GPP was the worst assignment I've ever done, especially since a member of my 3-person group did nothing. Prof. Avery should have mid-semester group evals to weed out free riders. Lectures were dry and hard to follow, prelims were absurdly difficult and she took off points for not mentioning things that were not asked as part of the question."
6903,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,1.0,4.0,"Hated this class. Interesting material, but her teaching was terrible. Obscene amount of work outside the actual class. Not accommodating &amp; expects u to prioritize her class over others. Narrow-minded in that she can't see how less-privileged ppl might b affected by policies. 2 other PAM majors I know switched out of the entire major b/c of her."
6904,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,3.0,4.0,"The actual material for this class isn't particularly difficult, but the way that it is presented in lecture is confusing and hard to follow. The group project took up a ridiculous amount of my time (easily 80+ hours over the course of 2 months) and the prelims were hard- average raw score was a D for both of them, but they're scaled to a B."
6905,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,1.0,4.0,"Useless readings. Killer prelims, b/c there's so much material &amp; b/c the way she words questions makes it hard to know what she wants. No final, but a group project. Thinks her class is the most important &amp; schedules mandatory events over ur other classes. Hardest class I've taken in two years. Lectures are 60+ slides long &amp; convoluted. Great TAs."
6906,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,2.0,4.0,"This class has so much potential but Prof Avery makes it the worst course at Cornell. Her slides are poorly executed--each powerpoint is between 60 and 70 slides, lacks structure, full of text, and she flies through them. Her class is scattered with no focus, and there is endless useless and over-tested dense reading (lack focus/meaningfulness)"
6907,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,3.0,4.0,"She's a wonderful person, but she flies through hr lecture slides that no student can actually catch up with what she's trying to teach. This class is a LOT of work. I feel like I did learn a lot, but because of the fast pace of the class, I don't think I have retained much. If you want to learn about policy (and turn cynical), I recommend taking."
6908,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,3.0,3.0,"I always got the sense Prof. Avery was talking down to us  while it is a freshman-heavy course, it isn't the first exposure to college work for a lot of us. Her lectures contain a lot of material. The group paper was absolutely awful and allowed for a ton of free riding, which was ironic since she taught about the negatives of that in lectures."
6909,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,5.0,3.0,Best class I've taken so far at Cornell. Material was interesting and Prof. Avery was engaging. Prelims/final were tough to study for (lots of memorization) but if you put in the work and studied a few days in advance they were fine. TAs are incredibly helpful. Do the extra credit. I think class average was around A-/B+ range.
6910,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM330,4.5,4.0,"Incredible educator concerned about the practical application of her teaching and well being of her students.  There's quite a bit of group work and assignments, but it's manageable if you pace yourself."
6911,204717,Rosemary,Avery,Cornell University,Political Science,PAM2300,4.5,3.0,"Her lectures are pretty fast-paced. Her powerpoints are quite dense, but she flies through them. Fortunately, she does upload all of her powerpoints online. Very helpful, but the material is quite difficult and heavy."
6913,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS3316,5.0,4.0,"Arias explains things very clearly and his class is extraordinarily organized. Although Psets were hard, taking 10-15 hours (I never went to office hours bcuz of time conflicts, which may have reduced the time ), I gained a really good foundation for quantum mechanics. Exams require you to work really fast but they're fair and easier than Psets."
6914,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS3316,5.0,4.0,Arias gives fantastic lectures. Course website is well prepared. Homework are quite a lot but generally inspirational.
6915,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,4.0,"Professor Arias was one of the most passionate professors I have had at Cornell. Even though I despised physics, he somehow managed to make me enjoy the class."
6916,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,2.0,5.0,"Arias is a nice guy, but is not very accessible to get help from. The P-Sets were incredibly difficult, covering material not taught and requiring 5-12 hours a week in office hours. The TA's often weren't sure how to do the questions (citing them as being harder than some of their grad-level P-Sets). OHs were ALWAYS packed (50-80 kids at a time)."
6917,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,4.0,"Professor Arias is a wonderful professor that really cares about his students. The problem sets and lecture videos/pre-class exercises are a lot of work, but Professor Arias' dedication to his job makes it very enjoyable and worth it!!"
6918,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,4.0,Take him now - it will be a fun ride.
6919,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,4.0,4.0,"Good teacher, only complaint is that the tests questions were asked in very obscure and confusing ways. Many of the tests were based on randomly plugging in formulas, without the need for much physics."
6920,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS3316,5.0,5.0,"Arias knows A LOT, and wants to meticulously prove things to his students. He is a GREAT lecturer, and is very open to talking to students both in and out of class. Homework was really difficult and took many hours (for me, 8-15), but I did come out of it a lot better at math."
6921,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,4.0,4.0,"Arias is very passionate, which makes lectures more enjoyable. Other than that the class is crap. The discussion section is not representative of the difficulty of prelims. The problem sets are WAY too hard and do not help you for the prelims. In my experience, you feel like you know your stuff and then the test rolls around and you don't."
6922,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,4.0,"I liked the flipped format of the class but I found the homeworks to be unnecessarily difficult. The tests were difficult but nicely curved. The lecture videos and questions were informative, organized, and easy to complete. If you put in the time to understand everything and attend lecture as the course goes on, you can do well."
6923,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,4.0,4.0,"Physics E&amp;M was a lot of work and demanded a lot of time that I sadly did not always have. Prof. Arias is a really nice guy who genuinely cares about his students and is truly happy when the median grade on exams is high. Don't sweat the problem sets too much, as long as you understand the Co-Ops you'll be okay for exams."
6924,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,4.0,"Arias really cares about the students. He gets very happy when people in class understand the topics in lecture, and if they don't, he does his best to clear things up. This course is very fast-paced, and Arias doesn't like to waste much time. The problem sets are incredibly challenging, but if you understand the COOPs you'll be fine on the prelims"
6925,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,4.5,3.0,He really wanted to see us succeed and seemed genuinely happy when prelim scores were high.  Probably the most likable professor I've had so far.
6926,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,4.0,4.0,"He kind of reminds me of a dad. He was very approachable and encouraging during office hours. I started off struggling, but he was always willing to accommodate my learning style. Some people liked the flipped classroom method, and things really started to click once we switched to videos."
6927,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Arias is a good teacher.  I learned a lot through his 'flipped classroom' method of teaching.  I would highly recommend watching the video lectures at  a faster pace, as Arias speaks kind of slowly and pauses a lot.  You can take a 45 minute video lecture and turn it into a 12 minute lecture.  Major time saver. Definitely attend lecture."
6928,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,3.0,"Professor Arias is the best professor that I have had in my time at Cornell. He is kind, approachable, knowledgeable,  and an all-around great guy. When students voiced concerns, may it be with format or content, he listened and acted, at one point even starting to produce hour-long video lectures to help. He is amazing, and deserves high praise."
6929,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,2.0,"Clearest professor I've ever had. Empathizes with what the student knows and doesn't on a intimate level. However, you'll have to do a lot of work for his class (if you want to do well, that is)."
6930,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,2213,5.0,3.0,Arias is truly dedicated to making sure his students understand the material. The exams (with the exception of the multiple choice on the first one) were very fair and very straightforward. Problem sets were challenging but very doable. He also made himself available for questions and pretty much wouldn't let you leave until you understood it!
6931,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,4.0,"Best professor I've had in my four semesters thus far. He's extremely helpful and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. He's also very passionate about the material and teaches is better than anyone else could. If you have a chance to take a class with him, don't pass it up."
6932,272878,Tomas,Arias,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2213,5.0,1.0,Simply the greatest
6933,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP5080,1.0,4.0,"In all my years as a student, Professor Schmidt is, without a doubt, the most DISCOURAGING instructor I have ever had. His lectures are disorganized &amp; have next to nothing to do w/the labs, the work we have to do. He has no idea what he is talking about. It's shameful that CU pays this uncaring man. The visiting lecturer should be THE GIS prof."
6934,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP5080,1.0,4.0,"His lectures are boring and repetitive. But the load of work for the class is heavy. In fact, he is quite helpless in supporting the tasks. The most surprising thing is, after all these bad aspects, he is such a harsh grader. I would not take his class ever again."
6935,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP3840,1.0,4.0,"Schmidt graded the one pagers harshly, without giving any feedback. Classes were boring, learnt nothing new."
6936,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP3840,1.5,1.0,"Really easy class, just plain boring. I never went to lectures and still got a good grade."
6937,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP384,5.0,3.0,I found Professor Schmidt very accessible and willing to help students
6938,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP4080,1.0,3.0,GIS is a really cool subject if you are in the URS program. Professor Schmidt has very limited knowledge about it and this is reflected in lectures. I went to ask for help in office hours and came out more confused. Just practice the labs over and over and you will get at least an A-.
6939,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP3840,1.0,3.0,"Makes at least one mistake per lecture on either the topic for that day or deadlines for an upcoming assignment. Papers aren't handled back with any constructive feedback. Still, Schmidtie has some interesting stories about Germany."
6940,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP5080,5.0,3.0,It would have been nice to have a lab on the use of python scripting
6941,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP4080,1.0,3.0,"The most conceited teacher ever. His favorite line is ""if you will"" and throws lots of academic jargon that it is beyond evident he doesn't understand. Thank God there were many graduate students in the class willing to help!!!! GIS is necessary for planning and a pity that only Stephan teaches it."
6942,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP3840,5.0,4.0,"final project allowed for more in depth analysis on topic of student's own choosing. Debates were good, but perhaps too many."
6943,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP4080,5.0,4.0,"Can be hard to get a spot in the class, but definitely worth it!"
6944,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP4080,5.0,4.0,"Frankly, too much work for the number of credits, but a solid grounding in GIS"
6945,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP3840,1.0,1.0,Lectures are atrocious and he doesn't seem to know what he is talking about. Nice guy though.
6946,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP3540,5.0,5.0,"I was already familiar with some of the topics covered, but overall a good class."
6947,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP4080,1.0,1.0,Received an A+ in GIS by teaching myself the material.
6948,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,GIS4080,2.5,4.0,GIS is always difficult regardless of who teaches it. Stephan's lectures are not coherent but sometimes he is willing to clarify material during office hours. I just think that it is the department's fault for not assigning a more experienced professor to teach the class.
6949,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP4080,1.0,3.0,Really needs to get his act together. The class is always disorganized and even the TAs get confused.
6950,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP5080,5.0,3.0,very good
6951,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP508,5.0,3.0,Very helpful in preparing me for an internship
6952,1044587,Stephan,Schmidt,Cornell University,Architecture,CRP4080,5.0,4.0,A very useful and applicable class.
6954,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH389,5.0,3.0,Dunning knows how to deliver a captivating lecture. He doesn't just read his slides - he presents it in a way that makes the material stick. Probably the best lecturer I've had. He's clearly very well-read. He goes over interesting topics in the class. Very engaging and approachable. One of the best Psych classes I've ever taken.
6955,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH389,4.0,3.0,Not an easy A psych class but Dr. Dunning is clearly a really knowledgeable prof. The material is interesting but lectures are spent just talking about other psych studies. Exams are blue book and you actually have to read for them too! Read the textbook and the articles and you should be fine for exams since the lecture material is pretty easy.
6956,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH389,4.0,3.0,One of the few lecture courses I've taken where textbook use is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED--YOU WILL NOT GET THAT INFORMATION IN LECTURE. He's an entertaining lecturer--pay attention and do the readings and you should get an A. Memorizing the many names and experiments in lecture is probably the most difficult thing.
6957,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH389,1.0,4.0,"Very condescending &amp; rude to students. He made many mistakes grading &amp; he doesn't really take responsibility for them. Unhelpful during office hours. I spent so much time, effort, &amp; work on this class, and got 60-70% on every assignment no matter what I did. Curve at the end of semester was VERY surprising. Grading scale was never made clear to us."
6958,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH487,4.0,4.0,"Now a Prof. at UMICH. Interesting class and lectures. Readings are necessary for exams, 1/3 of material tested. Recommend if you're pre law or interested in criminal psychology. Class wasn't too difficult once I got the hang of what he expected from the students. Tricky wording on tests though!"
6959,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2650,3.5,3.0,"The class isn't really difficult if you pay attention and take good notes during the lectures and if you read the require readings. Studying for the tests is absolutely necessary. The lectures are really fun, though, and this was definitely my favorite class last semester."
6960,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2650,4.5,4.0,"The best course I've ever taken. Dunning is a fascinating lecturer, very engaging with humor and flawless transitions. You must read and the tricky tests require studying and thinking critically (making outlines is helpful), but class is fun and the material is interesting. Quick, transparent grading. What you put in is what you get out. Must take."
6961,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2650,4.5,3.0,Great lecturer! Really helpful and makes the class interactive
6962,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2650,5.0,3.0,Fantastic lecturer!  Really animated and captivating. Great teacher!
6963,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2650,1.5,4.0,"Dunning needs to be fired ASAP (but won't since he's got tenure). The WORST teacher ever at Cornell. Completely useless and quite smarmy to talk to, when approached for help. His exams are ridiculous and his lectures are his time to gloat about Stanford rather than the material. If you are smart, avoid him. Not worth the headache at all."
6964,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2650,5.0,3.0,"GREAT class, excellent lecturer; this was actually my favorite class of the semester. Previous reviewers have said that Dunning is pompous, but I just think he's very self-confident, which wasn't a turnoff for me. Prelims are manageable, my 3 written assignments were graded pretty hard though. Final was also pretty difficult. Overall good class."
6965,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2650,4.5,4.0,"Very clear lecturer and makes the material pretty interesting.  A bit repetitive subject material and the readings are awful and long, but overall a very good class."
6966,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH265,4.5,4.0,"Great professor. Presents the material in a fascinating way with a good sense of humor but without dumbing it down. Challenging but totally do-able as long as you take it seriously, go to class, and do the reading. Overall, great class."
6967,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH265,2.5,4.0,"Hated this class. Dunning sucks. Really boring information, grades totally unfairly on exams , stupid writing assignments. Do not take this class if you're an engineer looking for a good or easy or interesting liberal arts class."
6968,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH265,3.0,5.0,"Very entertaining professor, but it's a difficult class. I went to almost every lecture, but I didn't do the reading and came out with a not so good grade. Tests are tricky. The class is probably much easier if you read the textbook."
6969,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH265,3.5,4.0,"The course material is interesting, and he is a good lecturer but this professor is arrogant and not a very good teacher.  To do well on tests you must memorize lectures and textbooks, which is not a very good learning method in my opinion, and although I got an A, a year later, I don't remember a thing."
6970,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH265,3.0,5.0,I could've gotten a better greade in nuclear physics. The best suggestion for those wanting to do well is to memorize the textbook verbatim. You'll still get a C though.
6971,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH265,3.0,4.0,"Great class and definitely worth the effort. However, he is very cocky and is not understanding at all. As long as you don't talk to him outside of class, it's a good experience overall."
6972,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCHANDLAW,3.5,1.0,"I was disappointed in this course.  The text book was elementary and watered down, but you better read it three times over to ace the tests.  I found Dunning to be narcissitic and cocky.  He makes basic grammatical errors in handouts, lecture slides and speech, which are inexcusable at his level in the profession."
6973,186100,David,Dunning,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH265,4.5,4.0,"Entertaining and upbeat lecturer and encourages class participation. However, he does have a big ego and his somewhat cocky attitude definitely comes through in class (""lalala I'm going to proceed with the lecture in my head and not give it to you until it's quiet"") Exams not so bad if you study."
6975,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,HIST1665,5.0,3.0,Professor Cowie is genuinely amazing. He is the most captivating lecturer I've ever seen. He's so smart and witty and he has his his finger on the pulse of what matters and makes his class relevant and enlightening.
6976,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILR110,5.0,3.0,Told me he had a very bad year 1314 but overall a very great teacher. Makes the class very interesting and worth taking.
6977,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILR1100,2.5,3.0,"Cowie's lectures are tough to follow because he has no powerpoint or slides to help. He does not have a website so if you miss a lecture, you're on your own. He grades much easier than his TA's; try to get your essay into his pile."
6978,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1100,1.0,4.0,"His lectures are really disorganized. I relied a lot on the TA, but that can't replace a quality/organized professor. He is a great guy and can deliver an interesting lecture, but those two things don't help when it comes down to writing papers etc."
6979,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1100,1.5,5.0,"WARNING: HE IS VERY DISORGANIZED. You will have to spend a lot of your time  trying to put everything together. He is a really interesting person to listen to, but he expects students to place everything into a ""Story"" but it's a story that you don't know the beginning, middle or end to because he's is SO DISORGANIZED."
6980,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1100,1.5,4.0,"He is a very interesting person to listen to, BUT, he is very disorganized and does not give clear instructions. As a person who loves history he made me hate the subject. The entire class is essay based and very subjective. You can make a great argument with great support, but if you don't say what he feels is important your grade will suffer."
6981,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1840,4.5,3.0,"Had Prof. Cowie for Six Pretty Good Books. Great professor, very well-read, excellent grasp of subject matter.  Knows how to engage the class and remains open to new ideas and views.  Likes to incorporate discussion into lectures and connect everything back to history.  I strongly recommend Cowie-he's fun, smart and will leave you thinking."
6982,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,AABBA202,5.0,3.0,He is a amazing teacher and the lectures are very interesting... he is also.. very very good to look at. Some of the girls just stare.
6983,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRLR1000,3.5,3.0,"He is a very entertaining and engaging lecturer.  If you need clarification about something in class, then he is very helpful.  He is not really available out of class for much discussion.  His TA this semester offered no help and was pretty much useless."
6984,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRCB1100,4.5,2.0,"Great prof. Great lectures, makes labor history interesting. Readings are long and necessary but doable. Papers and exams are fair. Highly recommended"
6985,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRCB1100,4.5,3.0,"Very smart, funny, extremely nice and helpful. Would definitely recommend taking any of his courses. He's a great guy who's hella hot. Makes Labor History remotely interesting, which is a tough thing to do. Grading is slightly tougher then other labor history courses, but definitely worth taking a slight GPA hit. Cannot recommend him enough..."
6986,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILR1,5.0,3.0,His was the best class I had at Cornell!
6987,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRCB100,2.0,3.0,He's really good and easy going
6988,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRCB100,3.0,4.0,"tough class. the TA is responsible for a lot of the  grading, which doesn't make it any easier. but, cowie is still the best because he makes it interesting.."
6989,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRCB100,4.5,2.0,"His lectures were very interesting, despite the fact that subject is boring. If you go to lectures and do the readings, you will be fine."
6990,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,CB100,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, really cares about the material. In order to do well stay on top of the reading and don't miss class + take lots of lecture notes."
6991,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,IRLCB100,4.0,4.0,"Fun, interesting class. Cowie is great professor (very passionate about the subject matter) and loves to teach. His class covers a lot of material. If you stay on top of the readings, go to class and take notes, and form study groups for the exams, you should be fine."
6992,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRCB100,5.0,3.0,excellent class...don't pass it up!
6993,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,HIST412,5.0,4.0,Selects really good readings and is a great discussion leader.  Demanding workload.
6994,163099,Jeff,Cowie,Cornell University,History,ILRCB306,4.5,3.0,Amazing Professor! His Recent History Class is Just Great! Highly Recommended

6997,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO3301,4.0,3.0,"spring 2019. Median: A. Cool material; lectures werent always interesting, so I had trouble following (couldnt stay 100% awake). She tried to be engaging; very passionate and excited. She posted enough info online to do the homework, and she gave clear expectations for the various assessments. Competent and knows her stuff."
6998,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO3301,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor that actually cares about her students. She makes the lectures interesting and teaches in a way that makes even more difficult concepts understandable.
6999,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO3301,5.0,2.0,"based Prof Kaltenegger is literally a god take her exoplanets class, it's not hard and the material is super interesting"
7000,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,"finally I can say my professor is on netflix IMAX movie ""Search for Life in Space"""
7001,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,2.0,Class is fun and inspiring. Professor is amazing.
7002,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1103,4.0,1.0,"Lectures were pretty slow, but no doubt every student could follow. Kept class involved and was a good prof, very open to feedback."
7003,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,"Professor loves astronomy and is a great teacher. She is inspirational. Come to class, she shows astronomy news first thing in lecture."
7004,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,2.0,Professor Kaltenegger is truly inspiring. She is extremely knowledgable and passionate in her field of Astronomy!
7005,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,2.0,"Lisa is absolutely fantastic!! She shows up to every lecture with a smile and current events from the astronomy world. She's silly and a bit scattered, but clearly knows her stuff and loves teaching it. She calls on random people to answer questions, so you gotta pay attention in lectures. I would definitely recommend taking her class!!"
7006,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,"Astronomy news and comics in lecture, learning to see the sky in a completely new way, highly recommend if you interested in astronomy"
7007,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,I always wanted to learn more about astronomy. Professor Kaltenegger makes me see the sky in a new way. Love her use of media and news in class.
7008,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,How often do you get to learn from one of the leading scientists who is searching for life in the universe? That is what Prof. Kaltenegger does. Lectures were inspirtational.
7009,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Kaltenegger is the director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell and is passionate about astronomy and her 1101 class. She makes the material accessible even if you do not have a ton of background knowledge. There is some math, but nothing super hard, mostly relationships. She changed my view of the night sky."
7010,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,4.0,2.0,Prof. Kaltenegger is so passionate about Astronomy and loves her ASTRO1101 class. She is scattered at times and she and the TA's are rarely on the same page.
7011,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,"Great introduction to astronomy, includes topics that are in the news. Do homework, come to section and lectures and class is easy. Math is easy"
7012,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,5.0,3.0,"attend class and sections and class is easy - great introduction to astronomy, you can skip one of the three prelims"
7013,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,4.0,2.0,"Lisa is a great professor. Oftentimes she can be a little scattered, but she definitely is inspirational. I thought the class was fairly simple and there is some physics involved. It's not hard and a background in physics is absolutely not necessary (gov major here). Pay attention in section, that's where test concepts are really introduced."
7014,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1103,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Lisa is very enthusiastic &amp; cares about the students in her class. I'm not a math person and was able to do the physics, although it didn't come easily to me. I counted more on the book (amazing book!) than on the lectures for the prelims/exams, but the lectures (and notes!) are helpful for sure. I'd definitely take again bc I learned a lot!"
7015,2047193,Lisa,Kaltenegger,Cornell University,Astronomy,ASTRO1101,2.0,2.0,"The class is extremely fascinating and is a must take if you're at all interested in astronomy. Lisa is very passionate about her work, but her lectures are very disorganized and incoherent. Some days I'd end up with 3 lines of notes from the entirety of the lecture. It's an easy class, but could've been a lot better with more structure."
7017,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, would highly recommend this class. Some students find the material dry, but everyone agrees that Fox does the best he can with the material and tends to deliver engaging lectures. Big on problem solving, not memorization: you really don't need to memorize anything. Go to the problem solving sessions!!"
7018,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,3.0,"My favorite prof. He's a really great guy, very human and down to earth. Really good at explaining complicated genetics stuff. I would take any class with him at the helm."
7019,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,4.0,This was the hardest class I've taken but it was very rewarding. Dr. Fox is so nice and his lectures are great. Btw this class is NOT memorization heavy. MY TIPS: Do all the tb practice problems! And never skip lecture bc he teaches stuff that isnt in the tb. Also OH are very helpful (Dr. Blake is great too!)
7020,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,4.0,"Challenging but overall very interesting class, important to go to lectures because he tests on that material, the textbook is good for supplementing lectures and practice questions. Dr. Fox is very friendly and approachable, and goes out of his way to help out."
7021,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,4.0,"Great professor definitely one of the more difficult courses at Cornell and hard work is necessary, but Fox is a genuinely enjoyable teacher who makes the best of it. Fox is also extremely knowledgeable and always available to talk."
7022,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Fox is probably the best professor I have had so far in my Cornell career. This class gave me my worst grade so far, but I genuinely enjoyed every bit of that class-no matter how hard it got. He is so passionate about what he does, and is such a caring person. When times got tough, he was there to listen to me. DO ALL THE TEXTBOOK QUESTIONS!"
7023,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3800,5.0,3.0,"This class is a real gem. I took it after enjoying my time in 2800, and it was one of my best decisions so far. Fox was hilarious as always, but in the small classroom environment he was also able to dig deep into the field of Genetics, while keeping the workload simple and accessible for everyone. Do your reading and you will get an easy A."
7024,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,3.0,"Professor Fox was committed to my learning. He was engaging, patient, and reasonable. His office hours were very helpful!! He was great at recognizing what material was confusing to students and allocating his time wisely. He was also great at reading my face and knowing when I was not understanding."
7025,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3800,4.5,3.0,Great class! IF you like genetics or are a GGD concentration I highly recommend. There are no tests just take home quizzes. You learn a lot (particularly about yeast) and its really interesting and current. If you need help or have to miss class he will meet with you. Highly recommend.  One of top 5 Cornell classes!!!
7026,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,4.5,4.0,"Difficult class, but good professor"
7027,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,4.0,4.0,Fox is a great guy who makes genetics interesting by teaching beyond the book. The course is probably the most demanding one I've taken at Cornell. Do EVERY SINGLE ASSIGNED TEXTBOOK PROBLEM to prepare for exams. Exams are difficult and the partial credit is abysmal. Go to every lecture; some things he mentions are not in the book but still tested.
7028,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,3.0,"Take Genetics with Fox! By far the best. His lectures are not verbatum from the text which makes it way more interesting. Go to his office hours not Neros, he is way more helpful"
7029,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,2810,4.0,4.0,He''s a very nice professor always ready to help or answer your questions when you need it. Class average is around 60-65  and some of the problems can be really hard on the prelims.
7030,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2800,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fox is very willing to help and interested in helping his students. The class has a bit of a bad rap, but taking it with Dr. Fox is really not bad."
7031,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,4.5,3.0,"approachable and willing to answer questions, offers clear solutions, affinity for motorcycles ups cool factor, tests fair"
7032,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,4.5,2.0,Completely adorable and a very enjoyable lecturer. Prelims are fair but the mean tends to be around 65 (curved to a B).
7033,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,4.0,"He's a spectacular lecturer who kind of reminds me of a mouse or some other twitchy, furry animal. If you listen to what he has to say, he's brilliant and great at making the material understandable. And he's very witty-funny. Also, a lot more clear and easier than Goldberg, who teaches in the fall. (Prelims still hard-- averages around 60.)"
7034,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG2810,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I've had at Cornell so far!  He gives very clear lectures and is brilliant but also approachable.  Take Genetics 281 in the spring with Tom Fox and you won't regret it. It's still going to be hard regardless, but at least your lectures will be interesting and organized."
7035,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOGD281,4.5,3.0,"Very thorough, engaging lecturer. Concerned with what students think, encourages questions. Extremely approachable during the lecture break, before, after and during OH. Thoughtful and understanding as well. If you need to take genetics, Spring is a good time! Plus, he's a yeast dude, unlike the Fall guy which is a Drosophila dude."
7036,113675,Thomas,Fox,Cornell University,Science,BIOGD280,5.0,4.0,"First-rate professor!  Excellent lectures- great explanations with occasional humor injected. Do/understand all book problems, as those are going to comprise the  majority of prelims. Tough class, grades maybe a bit deflated, but you'll learn a lot."
7038,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1170,3.0,3.0,"He's a really nice and funny guy. The grading is sometimes unclear, but he is always willing to help explain anything. Read the course packet notes he gives, you won't learn anything from the lectures. The lecture material was always way harder than anything tested on, the course packet is more accurate on what to expect. I believe he is retiring."
7039,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1170,1.0,4.0,Really bad at teaching the material because half the time he doesn't get it right and the student shave to correct him. He also goes on random tangents that don't help and ultimately confuse us more. He also has random guest lecturers cool but I'd rather go over what we've learned because he doesn't review at all and skims over everything.
7040,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1170,1.0,4.0,"Easily one of the worst instructors I've had. Even though he posts notes online, it really doesn't help given how messy his handwriting is. Incredibly scatterbrained and disorganized. To top it all off, the lab TAs are incredibly incompetent. Be ready to be on your own. Wish I had come here before signing up for this class."
7041,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,MATH2930,4.0,3.0,"At times, lectures were all over the place, but I ultimately learned a lot about differential equations from Sachse. The class was geared towards engineers and Sachse would always present examples of real applications of the topics learned in class which was nice. Finally, Sachse was very high energy and humorous during lecture."
7042,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1170,1.0,4.0,Intro to MechE was a nightmare under Sachse. Neither Sachse nor the TAs effectively communicated what was expected at any step of the way. The lectures were disorganized and the material we were tested on was eons harder than what was in the online textbook. Studied much harder than for my other classes and it still ruined my GPA. Do not take!
7043,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRI1170,1.0,5.0,"What should have been an easy intro course was a nightmare. Sacshse had poor communication with TAs, unfair quizzes (meaning he would tell us that he'd give us eq's to use and then forget about it), gave little guidance, and had poorly organized lectures. Time was better spent in lecture doing other hw, at least you would be efficient. Do NOT TAKE"
7044,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,4.0,3.0,"Good lecturer for 2020. Maybe he's awful for his other classes, but this one was great. Pretty funny guy who explained the concepts well. Made several mistakes on the board, but that's par for the course. I found the exams very straightforward and contained exactly what you expected. I'd take 2020 with him again."
7045,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE3272,1.0,5.0,He is very condescending and refuses to give students a clear objective as well as what is needed in the course.  He is one of the most poorly viewed MAE professors at Cornell University.
7046,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,2020,4.5,4.0,"Sachse is a really nice guy, he is especially helpful for answering questions."
7047,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE3272,1.0,4.0,MAE 3272. What should be an easy and fun 2-credit lab class was a painful experience. No clarity and arbitrary expectations and grading.
7048,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE3272,1.5,3.0,"I don't know who normally teaches 3272, but this class with Sachse was a total disaster. We had three labs where we learned nothing and many people (ESPECIALLY in Lab 3) had absolutely horrendous results. Sachse's instructions were vague at best and oftentimes we were shown stuff in lecture that have nothing to do with labs."
7049,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.5,2.0,"His lectures are a little fast-paced, but he keeps them pretty engaging. Reading the book before lecture is a must. The homeworks took an annoyingly long time. The exams and quizzes required a lot of practice in order to prepare, but are pretty fair. Overall, Sachse is good, but is probably a better teacher in higher-level courses."
7050,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,4.5,4.0,"Difficult teacher, but overall pretty decent. He's overall pretty clear, and a pretty interesting lecturer!"
7051,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,4.0,3.0,"I had to drop this class with Ruina and retook it with Sachse, and he was so much better. Exams were fair, psets helped, and the textbook was clear. Definitely better than I expected."
7052,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,4.5,4.0,"Sachse really is fairly decent - he does make a ton of mistakes, but his explanations are fairly clear if you keep up / read the book ahead of time. He's definitely better than average, and more than acceptable as a teacher. However, he makes the course very annoying - 2 psets a week are very annoying!"
7053,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.0,3.0,"Wow, I'm so surprised by other reviews. Maybe I just learn well by example but I think he is great. Other than a few careless errors (ok, a lot) he explains his examples very well. If you go to lecture, the class is fairly easy."
7054,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.5,4.0,"Sachse really isn't as bad as many people think - he's decent at explaining, and fairly clear. However, he is very tough - 2 psets / week and he doesn't curve."
7055,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2030,1.5,4.0,"The worst professor I've had at Cornell. Talks too loud sometimes, does example problems without even telling what it's an example for, rarely gives the important formulas (scan the book for them), lots of homework, scheduled a prelim the day before thanksgiving break. Made an easy subject hard! The TA taught better! Exams weren't too bad at least."
7056,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,TAM2020,1.0,4.0,"Sachse is okay for 2020 (he can do examples and can explain better than the other professors, but that's not saying much, it's just better than what you normally get). Any other course he teaches though is terrible in comparison though, which is saying alot. Truth is that the TAs will be your saviors for nearly all of his classes if your stuck."
7057,185115,Wolfgang,Sachse,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.0,5.0,2 different professors actually taught this course and I was unfortunate enough to have the other guy. Sachse  was a much better instructor and I frequently attended his lecture instead of my own. He goes very very fast in lecture but does great examples that are quite helpful. Overall a good guy but gets angry sometimes when questions are asked.
7058,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3040,3.5,2.0,"Great lecturer, makes the material easy to learn through powerpointsin-depth lectures. Easy to get at least an A- if you have a tough semester, easy A if you have more time. Dont get the textbook its only used for a few problem sets. Oh and if you want to learn how to become a ForEx trader from a crazy Armenian then this is the course for you."
7059,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,3040,5.0,1.0,"A good professor to take if you're not really interested in macroeconomics. If you go to lecture and actually do the homework, it's pretty hard not to get at least an A-. Personally, I was kind of disappointed at the lack of quantitative work we did in his class, but it might just be that macroeconomics doesn't use that much math to begin with."
7060,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3040,2.5,2.0,"Barseghyan is hilarious. His lectures are full of jokes and references to Armenia. He is truly passionate about economics and tries to instil an interest in the students. However, he's not the strongest lecturer. He often just kinda paraphrases right through what you have to learn and ignores the syllabus. Never used the textbook except for hw. "
7061,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3040,2.5,3.0,"Someone with real talent at jokes and supplement materials, sometimes they will last through the whole lecture. His exams are straight forward but it does require you to do a lot of self studies, especially when he vanishes right after class. Overall a good experience."
7062,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3040,3.0,3.0,Funny/entertaining lecturer but not the best teacher ever. Never uses the textbook. Don't really have to know the calculus because he doesn't ask questions that require it/you only have to regurgitate the information. I believe he curves to a B or B+. Interactive class atmosphere in which he often calls people out.
7063,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3130,4.5,1.0,"Levon is the man. Intermediate Macro is very much intuitive, and there are only a couple models that really just require a basic feel for intermediate-level math. He uses bimmers and armenia in his examples, no work required outside of class, his lectures were hilarious to sit through, take his class."
7064,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3140,2.5,3.0,"He's not a bad teacher and tries his best to help his students. On the flip side, he's also not the clearest lecturer and writes some annoying exams. The textbook is pretty much used for only homework and helps only a little with the tests. If one doesn't like wildcards, I would suggest taking intermediate macro with another teacher."
7065,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3140,2.0,1.0,"Really funny guy, who teaches not from some ordained syllabus, but from the heart. He'll want you to learn the underlying theory of economics and arbitrage -- not just cram information in your head for a test. He's a little too infatuated with himself and it can come across during office hours or lecture. However, he teaches to median of the class."
7066,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3140,3.5,2.0,"Good lecturer with a sense of humor. His lectures, though informative, usually have nothing to do with the actual textbook readings, so sometimes I wasn't quite sure of the points that he was trying to make. Manageable workload."
7067,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON313,4.5,2.0,Go Armenia!!
7068,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3140,4.5,3.0,Great class.  Levon is hilarious and he teaches you real world stuff which always keeps you interested.
7069,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3140,4.5,2.0,"This guy is hilarious! His tests were only on a relatively small part of what was taught in class. What he did do in class was talk a lot about arbitraging opportunities, and how to make money, and when to buy or sell our bananas or Beemers. Very good class, but he does have a tendency to move quickly through slides."
7070,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3140,4.0,2.0,"Barseghyan is funny, energetic, and insightful. He says explicitly that he doesn't try to trick you, and he doesn't. It's one of those easy classes that you get a lot out of, take macro with levon if you can."
7071,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON314,2.0,3.0,Funny teacher who makes class time interesting. But he does go over materials really quickly. You have to try hard to understand on the spot.
7072,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON314,4.0,1.0,"TAKE IT!  Lecture's are worthwhile for but materials are posted online.  The ""esteemed professor"" is hilarious and his prelims/finals are easy enough.  Practice prelims/finals are provided and are very helpful, as are the review sessions before them.  Prof's commentary is particularly interesting on the $-making and social side.  Awesome class."
7073,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON314,1.5,2.0,"Funny guy and easy class, but he does not do a good job of explaining the material. Very interesting to listen to, but you wont understand the material from listening to him."
7074,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON314,4.0,2.0,"great professor, so funny in lecture. doesn't try to trick students on prelims - he tells you exactly what will be on it. if you have to take 314, take it with him!"
7075,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON314,4.0,2.0,"He is hilarious! Need to study to do well, but the tests are just like practice prelims and have almost no numerical problems, so the class isn't too hard. He has an accent but isn't hard to understand. Lecture notes are decent, but I liked the textbook better. Wouldn't be unheard of for him to use cans of beer or bananas as money in examples."
7076,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON314,4.0,2.0,Great lectures but seems somewhat... impatient at times. But still hilarious. Don't underestimate the tests just because they look short. I made the mistake of overconfidence and I paid.
7077,278508,Levon,Barseghyan,Cornell University,Economics,ECON314,3.5,2.0,"Prof. Barseghyan makes the economic idea really stick in the students' heads. 10 years down the road, I might forget everything else I've learned in college, but I am sure stuff I learned in 314 will stay in my head."
7079,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,1.0,4.0,"His teaching style and delivery was dry and uninspiring for the most part. Compared to some other teachers I've had at Cornell, he didn't seem very excited about what he was teaching. His pedagogy skills weren't very noteworthy. Sometimes his decent sense of humor would come through, or he'd talk about something interesting unrelated to diff eq."
7080,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MAE5790,5.0,3.0,"I am watching his lectures on Youtube. Professor Strogatz is great at presenting materials. Also, he's fun and inspiring. I am glad that this course is accessible for everyone."
7081,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4220,5.0,3.0,Steve is an excellent professor. He's able to take complicated topics and explain them with great ease and clarity. This class was both interesting and well-run. Sometimes the lectures get behind the homeworks and it becomes harder to do a few questions though. Steve's also a nice grader and the class is curved pretty generously.
7082,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1300,5.0,2.0,Steve is a living legend.
7083,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,M4200,5.0,3.0,"I took him for the upper level math class that was crosslisted as the graduate mechanical engineering course. He is beyond kind and really takes time to prepare his lectures and references helpful parts of the book that he wrote. He even says hi to me when I see him  in Malott. Overall, an amazing individual who is dedicated to his students."
7084,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4220,5.0,3.0,The most engaging math class I've ever taken at Cornell. I like how Professor Strogatz uses visual representation to convey concepts. The material and grading is also not too hard. Awesome class overall.
7085,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MAE5790,5.0,3.0,My favorite lecturer at Cornell. He keeps class interesting and is very clear. He is also very available outside of class
7086,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1300,5.0,1.0,"Fun class, lots of games and mini-projects, grading is vague though"
7087,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4220,5.0,2.0,Steven is hands down the best Maths professor ever.
7088,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4220,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, well organized, very clear lectures and homework, reasonable tests and grading policies."
7089,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1300,5.0,1.0,He was a really great professor and really tried to make math engaging. He worked with you at your own level and always tried to incite discussion between students. We had short reflective journal entries after each class so it really wasn't much work.
7090,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4220,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor, makes difficult topics very clear and fun. Lectures are pretty entertaining and interesting; goes at a good pace. Really helpful and a nice guy as well."
7091,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4220,5.0,4.0,Awesome Prof
7092,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1106,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic professor. Hard, but worth it. Curves grade to a B. Definitely knows his stuff, one of the best math teachers I've had. Makes lectures interesting and funny. If you put in the work, you will definitely come out of the class with the fundamentals of calculus down."
7093,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH3110,3.0,4.0,"This is the first year he taught Analysis. While it wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't good; while he makes lectures enjoyable, he ended up spending a lot of time on material that wasn't ultimately necessary (like failed historical proofs) while glossing over much more important info. Awful book, awful TA, and lectures weren't as rigorous as his HW."
7094,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4220,4.5,3.0,"Professor Strogatz is a great teacher. He has vast experience in Math and Physics which he incorporates into his lectures by explaining how certain theories and methods can be applied. Not only is he great at teaching the material, but his lectures are also entertaining and casual, which makes class much more enjoyable."
7095,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1300,5.0,2.0,"As good of a professor as you could possibly hope to have. Clear, helpful, and a great speaker."
7096,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH,5.0,3.0,An excellent professor.
7097,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MAE5790,5.0,2.0,He offers tons of interesting case also the clear and deep reasoning behind them. His course about Chaos definitely give me the new perspective about the world and the way to understand it. Love this guy!
7098,423457,Steven,Strogatz,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2930,3.0,4.0,"He is one of the ""star"" professors at Cornell, but he sure is not a ""star"" instructor. He is intelligent, has insights, and so on - but he is not able to communicate his thoughts effectively &amp; correctly. Plus, why does he make students memorize trig formulas and geometry formulas for DiffEq exams? I guess that adds ""stubborn"" to his teaching style."
7100,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,5.0,3.0,"Karl cares immensely about his undergraduate students, and is incredibly distinguished in this field. He goes out of his way to help and mentor students in their careers. When grading, he will taken into account your commitment to the class, so expect to attend lectures. Hands down, the best professor I've had during my time at Cornell."
7101,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,PLBIO2410,5.0,2.0,"I loved Professor Niklas! He cares so much about his students' success that he gave me 4 points back on a test because my answer was in the reverse order. He will be teaching this course for the last time in Fall 2018, so take it while you can. There is a lot of material, but its not difficult and he makes it interesting and fun. Overall fantastic!"
7102,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,PLBIO2410,5.0,4.0,"Professor Niklas is super reasonable with grading, and he really cares about his students and WANTS them to reach out to him for help. I wish he depended a little less on the TAs for grading, and I wish he slowed down for lectures, but he made really boring material entertaining to learn!!"
7103,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,PLBIO2410,5.0,3.0,He teaches in a clear and direct way. He supplements his teachings with power points to show plant examples. He also challenges his students to make connections with each unit and use common sense when asked an indirect question. He brings food that relate to the topic in lab. He has funny stories to share that help me remember what was taught.
7104,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,5.0,3.0,"Best course Ive taken. I think hes retiring soon so I would take his course while you can. Hes accessible and articulate, and is keeps the course interesting."
7105,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,2.0,4.0,"Overall I dislike his method of teaching. He uses picture slides and then goes over important materials very fast, then goes off onto tangents about information that doesnt matter or his life stories. Test materials are taken from lecture and extensively detailed labs. He expects you to figure out what is important for the test."
7106,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,PLBIO2410,5.0,3.0,"This was by far the best course I have ever taken. Professor Niklas is a truly amazing lecturer--engaging, knowledgeable, and quite funny! I actually looked forward to getting up a little early to make it to the 9am lecture knowing what was for sure to be waiting. He may be retiring soon, so take his courses while you can! A true gem at Cornell"
7107,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,4.0,4.0,Lectures are very interesting and he posts all of the powerpoint slides online. Lab requirement for the class can prove to be more difficult. No formal lab reports but there's a short quiz every lab about the material from the previous lab. Textbook is overly advanced and it's hard without somewhat advance knowledge going into the class.
7108,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,5.0,4.0,"Easily the best prof I had at Cornell.  His lectures were stimulating, fascinating, and always left me wanting to learn more.  I have never quite experienced a class that was so incredibly well done."
7109,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL4480,5.0,1.0,It's the last day of class.  I will miss him as my teacher (I am graduating this semester).  He is a very caring and wise man.  Nothing like some of the other professors around here.
7110,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,PLBIO4480,5.0,3.0,"He has a strange sense of humor, but I laugh at his jokes because they really touch home.  He is a very caring professor and I love his class.  Others have said this.  And I will to.  He's awesome!!!  Take this class."
7111,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL4480,5.0,3.0,"This is my second class with him.  Just one lecture (the first of the term) and I already know that this semester will be wonderful.  Evolution, Darwin, molecular biology, and some old common sense.  It's great here."
7112,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,PLBIO2410,5.0,3.0,"He gave a review last Tuesday that was awesome!  Told us he was proud of us and that we could ""do anything we can imagine"".  And he said he loves us as students and that he was proud of us.  Awesome teacher"
7113,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,5.0,3.0,He is a wonderful teacher and a passionate lecturer.  This is the last week of class and I realize that I will miss getting up at 8 AM to listen to his lectures at 9 AM.  Awesome!
7114,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,5.0,3.0,He's a great lecturer and very entertaining. He visits my lab every week and asks if he can help us.
7115,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL241,5.0,2.0,"Pedagogically speaking, he is a master and a perfect model of effectiveness.  He is humble, positive, and possess strong subject acumen.  He breaks infomation down to digestible pieces, and his impeccable physical appearance makes him easy on the eyes.  He has restored my faith in learning science at Cornell (after my hellish experience in  Bio)."
7116,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL241,5.0,1.0,I took the class last semester and I was recollecting that I enjoyed the class. And then I was thinking about the professor and how careful he was with us as students.  It was a great class and he really made me feel like what he was saying was said to me.  I felt so good about it.  I fell in love with botany.  Plants rule!
7117,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL448,5.0,1.0,"He is so excited about the subject.  Gets tongue-tied talking about parts in the lecture.  He makes me want to be a paleobiologist.  I love evolution because of his lectures.  But he says that there is no conflict between evolution and theology, and I agree.  Take this course!"
7118,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL2410,5.0,2.0,Great teacher. Cares about the students.
7119,579937,Karl,Niklas,Cornell University,Biology,BIOPL241,4.5,3.0,great lecturer
7121,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1113,5.0,2.0,"FRESHMEN, TAKE THIS FWS!!! One of the most interesting classes I took my freshman year. Professor von Wittlesbach is so knowledgeable, and I could have listened to her talk about anything. A great mix of reading, movies, and guest lecturers. You learn essay, email, and fiction writing. I think everyone got an A, some an A+"
7122,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,JWST2720,5.0,4.0,"This is the best class that I have ever taken. Professor Von Wittelsbach enhances the class with interesting materials and top notch lecturers. Lectures were given by journalists, authors and filmmakers. She was very accessible after class. For someone who has never been to Italy, my experience in this class makes me feel as if I had."
7123,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1113,5.0,3.0,Professor von Wittelsbach was an amazing professor in my FWS ITAL1113. I highly recommend taking her FWS as you not only learn a lot about the course material but Professor von Wittelsbach is simply a well of knowledge who is ready to share her brilliance with you at any time. You simply have to ask.
7124,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,GOVT3323,5.0,3.0,"One of my favorite professors! I loved GOVT3323 &amp; Italian-Jewish History FWS with Kora! Always so helpful and accessible for questions, she managed to make in-class discussions insightful &amp; gave constructive feedback on papers. She seamlessly oversaw different activities for GOVT CiT &amp; made sure everyone was safe. I learned so much from her!"
7125,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,GOVT3323,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I've had the honor to learn from. Not only did she go above and beyond during the Cornell in Turin program, she mentored me and helped me even after the program. From CiT in 2015, we are still very much in touch and I can always count on her for a recommendation letter and guidance. She truly cares about the students!"
7126,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,GOVT3323,5.0,2.0,"My favorite professor, whom I cannot recommend enough. Not only is Prof. KvB attentive to all of her students, she is one of the most diligent and inspiring instructors/administrators I have ever had. The GOVT CiT course in Turin was expansive but never overwhelming, as were the Italian courses I have taken with KvB in Ithaca. Can't go wrong!"
7127,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,PAM3320,5.0,2.0,"This is by far the most outstanding prof. that I have ever had the opportunity to work with. Not only did she lead the course well (CiT), but she has served as a continuous mentor even after I left her classroom. Because of her support and encouragement, I was able to pursue an internship which related to the class that she led. Highly recommend."
7128,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1113,5.0,2.0,A wonderful Professor and person. Professor Wittlesbach cares about her students both inside and outside the classroom. She has been one of the nicest Professors I have met at Cornell. Definitely take!
7129,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITA3130,1.0,5.0,Really tough grader. Class was not enjoyable
7130,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1401,5.0,4.0,A wonderful intellectual and always engaging.
7131,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1401,4.0,4.0,She's really nice and definitely cares about her students. As long as you put in the effort you will get a good grade.
7132,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1113,5.0,2.0,"Professor von Wittelsbach truly cares not only about her students' learning, but also their well-being. She's very understanding if you need an extension, let alone being an excellent teacher. She's really funny and makes the class feel like a mix of shabby-chic and professionalism (you have to have her if you wanna know what I mean)."
7133,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ROMS1108,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant professor. The way she incorporated her knowledge of Mediterranean literature, history, culture and her personal experiences of the Mediterranean made every seminar extremely interesting! She is very sweet and approachable, cares a lot about her students and is very passionate about what she is teaching. I truly learned so much from her."
7134,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1401,5.0,3.0,"Professoressa is one of the most incredible teachers you will meet at Cornell. Not only does she teach you Italian, she also elaborates on Italian culture and extends on modern issues around the world. She is genuinely interested in student development, and will take the time to help you if you request. A true romanticist of modern times."
7135,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,FWS,5.0,1.0,"Professoressa is the greatest teacher ever. She is the type of teacher who is there to grow your mind and help you think, and is not just to show off how brilliant she is (even though she is ridiculously brilliant). Definitely take her classes. Her lectures are interesting, inspiring, and engaging. She is also incredibly sweet and an great dresser."
7136,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITALIAN3,5.0,4.0,"She's brilliant, as a teacher and as a scholar. One of the best learning experiences at Cornell."
7137,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,GOVT3323,5.0,3.0,"Govt 3323 class in Turin, Italy: the BEST class at Cornell so far! Professor W and other great instructors from C and Turin, varied and interesting readings (a lot of them!), great weather, food, a whole bunch of trips to museums and out of town. A+"
7138,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL1210,4.5,3.0,Very wonderful professor. She knows a lot about Italian culture and language. She is a very sophisticated and intelligent woman with a sharp sense of humor. Highly recommended! She does expect a lot from her students but if you show that you are dedicated you will have a great time in her class. She even took us out for coffee to Stella's!
7139,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITAL3130,5.0,4.0,"Kora is by far the best professor I ever had at Cornell. She is incredible in so many levels: intellectually, spiritually, charismatically, you name it. Her courses are so inspiring, challenging, and interesting, that even a bad course you might be taking will seem fun when you have her. She certainly deserves eternal life after this one."
7140,247163,Kora,Battig Von Wittelsbach,Cornell University,Government,ITALI3130,4.5,4.0,"Loved it - the best professor in the romance department! Lots of homework, though."
7142,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,MSE5150,5.0,3.0,"Professor Petru Petrina is an amazing professor. I've had him for MAE 2120 back then and now MSE 5150. He really knows his course content, and will admit when he doesn't know enough and will do research to learn more. He was thought to have retired when he stopped teaching MAE 2120, but has since returned to teach a smaller MSE 5150 class."
7143,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,MSE5150,5.0,2.0,Very organized lecture. Homework extremely helpful for exam. PP is a nice and interesting professor.
7144,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2120,2.5,2.0,"He's funny but I have to admit, he is not really a good lecturer. Some people decides to miss the lectures thinking that it's not helpful but professor really hates these people. You will benefit anyhow if you try to pay attention to what he's saying during lectures. Most of the materials though, I had to learn from the textbook."
7145,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,4.5,2.0,"Great professor. Always entertaining and willing to help. Accent is a little thick, but you get used ot it pretty quickly"
7146,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.5,2.0,"Petrina makes the class pretty straightforward and easy. Pretty good professor. Two problem sets a week and labs were VERY annoying and time consuming, but everything else is fine. Oh and he's not teaching 2020 anymore (feel sorry for everyone that has to take it with someone else now)."
7147,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,3.0,3.0,"The class isn't that hard, and you can probably get a good grade just by reading from the book. Two homework sets a week was quite annoying, and the lab was worthless; other than that, the class was pretty straightforward."
7148,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2120,4.5,3.0,"Petru is a great professor. He does a fairly good job during lecture, but what I found most helpful were his office hours. He doesn't like office hours so he will leave early if you don't keep asking him ques. He is always around though and encourages students to pop into his office or call him any time. Take advantage of this! He's hilarious."
7149,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,4.0,2.0,"Course progresses slow but steady, hardest in the middle, fine teacher if a touch disorganized presentation of material. A bit too much homework for a relatively easy subject. Not too difficult to do well, tests were sometimes too long for the time given (which was extended to start with)."
7150,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,4.5,4.0,"Petrina is a great professor in general. If you dont mind his accent, you will like him. His gradings are objective and discussions are oftenly helpful. He wears same jeans and sweater everyday and it kina bothered me (dont know y) He is good and funny and I recommend you take his course (i guess u have to if u r a mechE or Civil)"
7151,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,3.0,3.0,"Had him for MAE 212 and 202. Actually not that great at teaching. However, he is one of those professors you 'must have' before graduating. The funniest prof I've had. Petru is the man."
7152,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE2120,3.5,4.0,"I loved pp when I had him for 202...it was easy and fun. Now in 212, it's really hard and generally unclear. He goes really quickly and everyone gets confused. But he's really nice and pretty funny"
7153,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,2.0,4.0,"He was a funny guy, but a terrible teacher.  You can learn the material out of the book, but don't count on learning anything in his lectures."
7154,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD2020,5.0,5.0,Petru is amazing! He's my favorite professor. very knowledgeable in his field and very sweet and funny. He is definately on the student's side and lectures are good.
7155,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,3.0,2.0,Petru is the man!
7156,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,4.0,2.0,He's a great teacher and seems to have a lot of experience in the field he teaches about.  It's worth it to attend lectures just to hear him get excited about all the money he makes from his creations.  And to hear him say 'equilibrium' in his awesome accent every other second.
7157,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,MAE101,4.0,1.0,summer 07 was petru's 1st time teaching the course so he wasn't able to fit all the usual material into the 6weeks. Seems impossible to me. Petru is still the man though!! I know he tried his best plus he made the final really easy in compensation.
7158,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,4.5,3.0,"Petrina is one of my favorite professors in the engineering department.  He seems to care about his class, and is a genuinely nice guy (go to office hours).  I think he curved the class pretty high.  He's not the absolute best lecturer, but what he lacks in oral communication, he more than makes up for in visual depiction.  In short, Petrina rocks."
7159,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,2.5,2.0,"117 and 202 - His lectures are quite repetitive, and he doesn't like to help out, but the class itself isn't overly hard."
7160,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,3.5,3.0,"Good teacher, but don't ask him for any favors. The class itself was on a difficult curve."
7161,235604,Petru,Petrina,Cornell University,Engineering,ENGRD202,4.5,2.0,"PP is great,made coming to lecture fun. His corny jokes crack me up. I love how he randomly starts talking about his research or various inventions.Helpful, though he tends to not like going to OHours. However, he tells u to stop by his office any time if you need help, I,ve done so a few times and he's always willing to give up time."
7162,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1130,4.5,4.0,"Propaganda was an incredible course. This professor is a tough grader, but she is a very sharp, critical reader. She will tear your essay apart, but if you're willing, you will learn so much about expository writing, and how to craft watertight arguments. The essays aren't easy, but you will stretch your critical thinking and writing skills."
7163,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1110,2.5,5.0,"She just likes to shut people down in class, prob one of her main hobbies. She's stern and mean, but she does have a sense of humor deep down. She is a hard essay grader, like ugh. We do 8 essays over the semester, and the eight one is due a month before finals (which im not sure is allowed), but she also extorted $22 from each of us..."
7164,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1130,4.0,4.0,"She provided a ton of helpful criticism, and once I got over her tearing my papers apart my writing improved markedly."
7165,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1110,1.5,5.0,"To put it simply, Orlov is a BUCKET OF CRAZY.  She's hell bent on destroying any sense of confidence you have in your writing, in addition to making you fear any statement you make in class.  She believes only her OPINION is right, and if you don't explain that opinion using the exact words she would use, you'll be publicly ripped to shreds."
7166,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1110,1.0,5.0,at first a very interesting class....until you actually start writing papers. orlov is an evil woman and will spend all her time nitpicking every word you write. absolutely no learning experience and did not improve my writing in any way shape or form. only ruined my ego and gap
7167,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1130,1.0,5.0,I took her class in FWS Propaganda because I thought the topic would be interesting. I wouldn't recommend taking this class to ANYONE. She shuts down ideas if they don't match hers and she basically gives out B/B-'s for every paper. Avoid this FWS if you can! Highly recommend dropping this and taking another FWS because it's not worth the low grade
7168,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1290,1.0,4.0,"okay seriously, please please do not take this class! IT IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY COLLEGE LIFE! She grades horribly, hypocritically, and inconsistently and she is a horrible ""teacher."" yea her paper's are 2-4 pages but i would honestly rather write a 12 page philosophy paper like 1st semester"
7169,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1290,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!
7170,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,FWSFWS,1.0,5.0,"STEER CLEAR OF THIS CLASS. it is absolutely RIDICULOUS. It doesn't matter if you have gotten an A on every single paper that you have every written, she will CRUSH YOU. she has some skewed, narrow minded version of what is right, and trying to figure that out is IMPOSSIBLE. SHE IS AWFUL BEWARE."
7171,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,FWSFWS,5.0,1.0,"OMG she's so awesome! makes college level study look like child's play! homework's are easy. Out of 10 homeworks, lowest 4 is dropped. exams are take home and account for 60%! attendance is not required! she'll help you in every way she can!"
7172,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,FWSFWS,1.0,5.0,This abusive woman commands a very practical teaching plan: you won't know what hell is like unless you are in one.
7173,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1290,1.0,5.0,"God forbid you should actually want to have a discussion in this class. She has a very narrow view of what's right or wrong, despite what she says about different points of view: If your opinions are against hers, expect to be shut down.  Switched out into a different course as soon as I could"
7174,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1104,1.0,5.0,"Before taking this class, I thought it would be interesting. Though the material was mildly interesting, the teacher more than made up for it. She is unhelpful and she thinks her way is the correct way and all others are wrong for even thinking differently. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. After taking her class, I want to jump off a gorge."
7175,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1290,1.5,5.0,"I hate David and Goliath. Never once mentioned the biblical battle. She has this preconceived notion of studies of scale in her head and does a poor job of passing it on to her students. Doesn't teach, simply belittles and nitpicks. Comments are not helpful, grading is unfair. Meeting with her is like getting trapped in a dungeon. BEWARE."
7176,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM1130,1.0,5.0,Orlov's lack of intelligence and common sense is bewildering. She expects every student to write papers exactly as she would. Her grading is inconsistent and hypocritical. I am actually a less intelligent person now that I took her class.
7177,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUMSECT,1.0,5.0,This class is the biggest regret of my college life thus far. It almost made me want to transfer out of Cornell. She LIESSS!! She  told me that the class would be graded on effort and not on the ridiculously low grades she gives everyone for their essays. LIES!! Do not take any class that she teaches if you want to maintain at least a C.
7178,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM113,2.0,5.0,"Taking this teacher was the biggest mistake of my first semester in Cornell.  She will not hesitate to make you feel like crap.  To top it off, it already ruined my GPA.  If you do not want to taste hell, AVOID THIS CLASS AT ANY COST!!!!!"
7179,266830,Sidney,Orlov,Cornell University,Humanities,SHUM119,2.5,5.0,"Only take this class if you don't want to get anything higher than a B-. Orlov is extremely unhelpful, when I asked her to go over a few of my papers with me, she flat out said no. It's useless to argue with her, she's stubborn and difficult. Avoid her if at all possible!"

She is intelligent but she grades really hard. She likes to put you down when you make a remark in class discussion.  UNREAL expectations and will crush your GPA and make you feel like hell. STAY AWAY!!!!!! for your own good"
7183,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST1180,2.0,5.0,WORST DECISION OF THE SEMESTER. Class was on viking peoples and many readings were in Old Norse... that nobody knew how to read???? At one point he made someone cry because he misinterpreted what he/she said and then continued to insist that he was correct in his interpretation. He also compared my writing to a mental disorder...
7184,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST1660,5.0,3.0,"Professor Falk is the best thing that happened to my undergrad career at Cornell. I did both a class and an independent study with him and he opened my eyes to a new world of history. I finally felt like I was being understood, I am forever grateful. His class was fun and interesting and as long as you cared you are going to get a good grade."
7185,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST1180,3.0,3.0,"Very much a mixed bag. Assigns lots of reading but guides discussion of it very well, good at pushing a free conversation among students to useful places. Unfortunately he also gives maddeningly cryptic responses to even the most straightforward questions, especially about assignments and grading. Grading and comments are mostly unclear/unhelpful."
7186,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST2742,3.0,5.0,"Clearly very smart guy. Had ridiculously high expectations based on the level of the class, and did not teach you how to conform to them. Unclear in his assignment instructions and expectations. SUPER tough grader, concerned with grade inflation. Feedback was mostly critical, not constructive. Heavy reading load. Got visibly annoyed with students."
7187,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,2742,1.0,5.0,"GOD, please don't take this professor's class. Lectures are boring than hell, grading is tough (totally based on how he likes you; he's extremely obssessed with the problem of grade inflation ), readings are unbelievably huge (even if most students mentioned this and he changed the amount of readings but still the course is too time-consuming)"
7188,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HISTSEM,5.0,4.0,Oren takes a little getting used to and has a dry sense of humor but he is extremely helpful and a very fair grader (he gave me a higher grade on my final paper than I likely deserved because I was engaged with the class). He is a wealth of knowledge and one should probably actually do the work for his classes. Great teacher and scholar!
7189,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST1510,4.0,3.0,"This class was demanding, but well worth the effort. The pace was fast but all of the material seemed important and interesting. To receive a high grade in this class, one must be willing to think critically, closely examine readings, and be present and attentive for all lectures."
7190,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HISTO4444,5.0,4.0,"Professor Falk is very intelligent and helpful. His criticism can be harsh, but it's always constructive. He helped me improve my writing and my ability to analyze both primary and secondary sources. More than any other professor that I've had as a History major, he's willing to go out of his way to help you improve your own work. A passionate prof"
7191,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST1510,5.0,3.0,"He's really really nice and helpful. Though his class may be boring, but if you have any problem, he'll always be there ready to help you. He can spend a lot of time helping you clarify any issue. I really love him! He's amazing! Though his essay requirements are sometimes vague, but just go to his office hours and ask him any necessary question!"
7192,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST1510,2.0,5.0,"(Hist 1510) The class was definitely hard, but it wasn't unfair either and I ended up learning a lot. Professor Falk's lectures can be snoozers at times, but he did bring in a few very interesting guest lecturers to liven things up. All in all, it was a good class that I would recommend."
7193,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST300,1.0,5.0,"Strange guy. He is smart (duh) and interesting but there is something wrong with him, just can't put my finger on it. Class was on vikings, which is boring as hell, and i'm a respectable history major. Perfect class for you if you are a dork or some risley weirdo who likes to play with fake swords."
7194,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST1180,1.0,4.0,"Egotistical, couldn't understand his assignments, harsh grader, extremely unhelpful when approached with questions."

But to this day, they are my favorite classes that I have taken at Cornell.  There is a lot of work, and the tests and papers are difficult.  But he is enthusiastic, prepared, and engaged.  Do yourself a solid, and take one of his courses"
7196,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST227,3.0,5.0,"Its weird, this guy is an AMAZING lecturer, well structured, clear, funny (without being desperate), engaging etc. But he assigns so much busy work that I actually dropped the class and audited instead. Auditing is def the way to go, dont try to actually write papers for the guy, but also dont miss the chance to hear his AMAZING lectures."
7197,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST320,4.5,5.0,"Seriously great professor. No doubt you'll have to work hard, but you will also learn a ton. Hilarious sense of humor. Some people make him out to be evil, but that's only because he's incredibly challenging. If you actually want to LEARN something while you're at Cornell, take one of his classes, any of 'em."
7198,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,DAFFAD,1.5,5.0,"OOOF what a dud. this guy is bizarre. he told me a story about how he wanted to be a pilot in the Israeli army but couldn't, and tried to make an analogy for students having difficulty keeping up with his cryptic assignments and verbose, soporific lectures. This is the kind of guy who uses unnecessarily complicated words and feels proud of it."
7199,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST400,4.0,5.0,he's great if you show any interest in the topic and he really wants students to learn something...expects a lot from students and has very high standards...great for seminars and serious students. probably not someone you'd want to have if you're fulfilling a requirement. no matter what he'll force you to learn.
7200,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST151,3.5,4.0,"Oren is very knowledgeable and he enjoys teaching. You will be expected to do lots of work and he will call on you during lecture. However, his efforts will undoubtedly surpass yours and I was continually amazed at his level of preperation. Do some work and you will learn plenty."
7201,268443,Oren,Falk,Cornell University,History,HIST210,5.0,3.0,"The best class and proffesor i've had so far.  Not so much work for this class, just one long paper, but he is very demanding and hold high standards.  Incredible class discussions."
7204,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2217,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gibbons did a fabulous job with the course. His homework was interesting, his tests were consistently middle-of-the-road fair, and he did a fabulous job making his lectures engaging and interesting. As with any physics class, expect to spend time reading the textbook. This course was a joy."
7205,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2217,4.5,4.0,"Professor Gibbons was a very engaged professor. Presenting from a theoretical framework, he started with force laws and derived the rest yet also had cool demos. He was even humorous with relevant Batman quotes. In short, the class was very enjoyable.  Gibbons provided ample assistance outside class with office hours and time to help with homework."
7206,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYSICS213,1.0,5.0,"I had no idea what he was talking about during most of the lectures, I tried to talk to him but he refused to help me."
7207,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2214,2.5,1.0,"He does a lot of demonstrations which is nice but the lectures are otherwise unorganized and not helpful. The homework is challenging as expected, but the tests are comparatively very easy. Course did not feel indicative of other honors physics courses.  "
7208,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2217,1.0,1.0,"Doesn't seem to understand the material, and no help. Gives the entire department a bad name. "

7210,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,2217,4.0,2.0,"Professor Gibbons made his class my favorite of the semester. His knowledge of physics is very deep and insightful, and his explanations are generally very clear. If you ask him for help, he can be a bit vague, but definitely  cares for his students. Also appreciates their feedback. In short, a wonderful mentor!"
7211,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,2217,1.0,1.0,Useless prof. Avoid if at all possible. Thank god for the TA.
7212,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,2217,4.0,4.0,"I found Professor Gibbons to be a very good lecturer.  It was challenging because it is honors level, but he did a great job of showing how and when concepts would be relevant. The assigned problem sets were very useful in solidifying knowledge and providing practice, and he is a very easy grader, as long as you show a basic understanding."
7213,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS2217,4.5,4.0,"Professor Gibbons is so far the best professor i've had at Cornell.  He always made himself available and really cared that you do well in his class.  Yes, the material was very challenging and i spent many hours studying and preparing for exams, but it is an honors level class.  He made it interesting and encouraged you to do your best."
7214,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1116,4.0,5.0,"Yeah, this class was ridiculously hard, but its an honors level at an ivy.  While his lectures weren't the absolute best, he was really helpful and when I went in to visit him during his office hours, he was beyond helpful and he even took an active role in giving me ideas for extra practice."
7215,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1116,1.0,5.0,he doesnt teach you anything.. the class is very challenging.. VERY challenging. if you take this class be prepared to self teach !!
7216,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1116,1.0,5.0,"Horrible, horrible professor. If you have any option other then his class, take it! Better off taking the class independent study because his lecture adds nothing to the textbook. The homework takes an absurd amount of time and the tests are confusing and come out of nowhere."
7217,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS1116,1.5,5.0,Worst teacher ever!!! Do not take a class with him. It will be a huge mistake! No redeeming qualities!
7218,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS116,3.0,5.0,"This class is really hard. Go to every section you can. He is a pretty boring lecturer, and fairly tough. Approachable most of the time for help."
7219,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS213,1.5,3.0,"His lectures are a waste of time.  I learned everything from section.  A good lab TA will make labs a pain, but you will ultimately learn much more."

7221,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS213,2.0,4.0,The TA's make his class understandable.  Thank your TA every day.
7222,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS213,1.0,5.0,attention cornell administration: GET BETTER PHYSICS PROFS. phyiscs department hands down has the worst professors in the school. tests are harder than anything covered in hw or class. this joker doesnt even give all the formulas and expects you to derive them....
7223,448664,Lawrence,Gibbons,Cornell University,Physics,PHYS213,2.5,3.0,"bad, but not quite as bad as everybody says."
7225,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,4.0,"I took her during COVID and she genuinely was THE worst quality, least accommodating professor/instructor Ive ever had. The other class with other Econ prof, had taken their Prelim #1, a week before our class already took Prelim 2. She stuffed so many chapters in a short sem, whereas the other prof actually cared ab the material/went at a pace"
7226,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,3.0,"PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER. SHE IS TERRIBLE, PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. A waste of three precious credits of my Cornell tuition and semester. I took her during COVID and I honestly feel like she was less accomodating than regular semesters bc she wanted to make the class harder since it was all online and she cant tell if we cheat"
7227,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,1.0,"Please do not take any Econ class with this professor. She is not accommodating at all; her lectures are below average; she, herself, is not a very pleasant person."
7228,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,2.0,3.0,Not my best experience with a professor. Her lectures were boring and had little to no engagements during discussions. Most of the content was self-taught through the online textbook.
7229,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,4.0,I took this class via zoom + over the summer so all the exams were open note which made the exams SIGNIFICANTLY easier. HW is much harder than exams. Exam questions range in difficulty. Practice prelims are helpful but easier than exams. Prof is hit or miss when it comes to explaining concepts. Sometimes she dodges the question
7230,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3430,2.0,3.0,nice person but super boring lectures. Keeps making football analogies that don't add anything to the course material. tests are solely based off of lectures and be sure to pay attention to the case studies. Not quite sure she understands the material herself but textbook help. overall easy class but not worth the boring lectures.
7231,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,5.0,5.0,"This class was extremely challenging for me. However, there are two things that you should keep in mind if you choose to take Thomas. First off, the class gets easier as the semester goes on. If you do not do well on the first exam I would recommend keeping it. Secondly, Thomas will help you if you are honest with her. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!"
7232,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,3.0,"Thomas is an extremely frustrating professor. Her lectures are excruciatingly simple yet the homework and exams cover more material and are more difficult. That being said, the class itself is not too difficult and a decent amount of work should get you an A. Her exams are extremely annoying to take with a lot of poorly worded questions and typos."
7233,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,1.0,3.0,"This class is the definition of disorganized. The style of learning differs between lecture, discussion, homework, AND exams. There's no consistency so you're better off skipping lecture and discussions all together because she doesn't take attendance. Just teach yourself through the textbook and pray you can figure out the weird exam format."
7234,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ILRLE2400,5.0,3.0,"If you have any passion for econ, Thomas will be the professor for you. She cares about all of her students and is an extremely energetic and motivational lecturer who's examples help me understand the concepts. If you to her practice tests and review every question before a test, you'll be fine. Probably my favorite professor this semester."
7235,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,4.0,2.0,Easy A if you're good at understanding functions/graphs with some intuition. Interesting class and doesn't go at a fast pace. No need to attend lectures but the lectures are good. Tests all multiple choice.
7236,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,4.0,"Not a great class but not too bad. She is not great at explaining concepts when they get a little more complex, and the tests are not easy. You may have to do a lot of textbook learning."
7237,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,5.0,3.0,Professor Thomas was amazing. I am would take another class. The grading is simple 25% for each of the 3 prelims and 25% for HW. The tests progressively get harder. The lectures are very simple and only a review of the chapters. To get a good grade you just need to take the practice exams provided and do the HWs. DO THE HW AND THE PRACTICE PRELIMS!
7238,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,2.0,"Easy class, but lectures are very boring and useless. I ended up only reading the textbook and got an A"
7239,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,3.0,"I went to almost every lecture and discussion and kind of regret it. If you schedule your time efficiently and make sure to be on pace with the chapters, you will be fine. I'd take Thomas over Sanders even though I think Sanders is the better professor from what I've heard since Thomas has easier exams that are all MC. Sanders has short answers."
7240,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,4.0,4.0,Thomas was a decent teacher. She did good examples in the lecture that often times went off topic. She didn't really go into deep applications in lecture. Discussion is a joke. Really the best way to do well is to teach yourself the lessons. There is HW due every week but really enforces the topics. HW is 25% of your grade and each test is also 25%
7241,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Thomas is one of the most amazing and involved teachers/professors I have ever had! I took ECON 1110 as part of the summer session, and, as only a rising junior in high school, was initially worried I would struggle in the class. But, Prof. Thomas helped me so much and made sure to explain everything in a way anyone could understand! Amazing!"
7242,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,3.0,4.0,"Spends too much time on very simple examples, doesnt always cover all the material that is on the homework."
7243,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Thomas is great. She's always available for one-on-one meetings (as long as you schedule a week or two in advance) and really explains material in a way that YOU can understand. She'll break lecture questions, homework/prelim questions, and textbook jargon down a thousand times without getting the least bit upset or frustrated. Solid 10/10"
7244,1913576,Stephanie,Thomas,Cornell University,Economics,ECON1110,5.0,3.0,I took her class over the summer. It wasn't too hard. Her review lectures were extremely helpful. I liked all of her lectures. She made the class very interactive. She used students as examples in some problems. The only tough thing about this class is the homework. There's a problem set that is due about every other class.
7246,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1350,1.0,2.0,"Honestly one of the worst professors or just teachers i have ever had. Acted like she knew everything but wound up asking students to answer questions cause she didn't know the answer. Super susceptible to ass-kissing and heavily picks favorites. Also, there were days she was just extremely rude when I asked questions or just super lazy to help us."
7247,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1350,4.0,3.0,"Really get to know her- she has so many industry connections and really sticks out for the students that she sees put an effort into her class. Participation, professionalism, and attendance are probably the most important things for a good grade in her class. She tends to favor kids interested in hotel ops, but overall a great professor for 1350."
7248,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1105,1.0,3.0,Super annoying lecturer who spent most of her time going on rants unrelated to the subject matter. Did close to zero preparation for the final exam which her grading made absolutely no sense. She needs to retire asap
7249,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1350,4.0,3.0,"Knows her material well. Has specific pet peeves: no using electronics, no chewing gum, no leaving class early, no getting up to go to the bathroom, etc. Has personality. Well dressed."
7250,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1350,3.0,2.0,"Should be an easy class. She grades the test difficult for no reason. She has an attitude so be prepared for her personality. If you are going into operations, you have a better chance of her liking you. Also some people say she's prejudiced. She knows what sh's talking about most of the time though."
7251,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1350,4.0,3.0,"Do not text, eat or chew gum in class. Do not leave early or come in late. Get on her good side by doing the above things and asking solid questions every once in a while and your life will be infinitely better."
7252,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1350,5.0,3.0,"Reneta is a true gem, and her Intro to Hotel Ops is one of the best classes. Reneta always had such amazing lectures that are never dull, and her last lecture was inspirational and heartwarming. The midterm is easy, but make sure you do all of the readings. While I thought I did well enough to merit an A, I only got an A- so she is a tough grader"
7253,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,1350,5.0,3.0,Reneta is a great professor! She is really specific on what she wants and you can always go to office hours for clarification regarding assignments. She is passionate about the course and it really shows through her teaching. Definitely my favorite course of the semester.
7254,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,1360,1.5,1.0,"Reneta just does not know how to teach. I have no idea why she teaches an introductory class expecting all students to perform outstandingly. She cannot do simple math (and I'm talking about percentage changes), avoid at all costs. Cornell's hotel school is at risk with such a poor professor; her husband on the other hand is outstanding."
7255,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HA106,1.0,4.0,Avoid at all costs.
7256,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HA4408,3.0,2.0,"Casinos - Great class. She was very enthusiastic about teaching, and was clear with her expectations. Do the readings because she gives quizzes. She also gives you all the questions for the final exam, so no reason to not do well. Class trips to Atlantic City and Turning Stone were also fun."
7257,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1105,5.0,1.0,Get on her good side. The questions on the exam are always exactly from the powerpoint. Do the reading before the exam. Don't ever text or use your lap top during class. She might kick you out.
7258,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HA105,5.0,1.0,"Easy A. Show up to class, write down what she says will be exam topics, and study that/the exam review questions and you'll be fine. She often includes the review questions verbatim."
7259,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM1105,3.0,5.0,"Definitely picks favorites. Careful on her exams- you will walk out thinking you did amazing only to get a C.  Questions are tricky, a lot of short answer and she is VERY picky about these. You'd think there should be multiple answers, think again..."
7260,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM105,4.0,3.0,"Reneta is clear, informative, and interesting. She may appear to be tough at first, but she is very kind once you take the time to approach her. Her class is very useful, especially for 174. However, she does play favorites, so it is wise to be on her good side. Just do all the work, which is very minimal, and you can get a good grade."
7261,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM105,5.0,2.0,She is a very good teacher. She explains concepts very well and is very enthusiastic about what she teaches. Much better than 106! I miss 105!
7262,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HA105,4.5,2.0,Reneta comes off as very interested in what she is teaching and seems to really care. She's big on Housekeeping issues. Seems to pick favorites but not in a really terrible way. Not a super difficult intro hotelie class but somewhat challenging I guess. I liked it/her.
7263,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HA105,5.0,3.0,Reneta was one of the best teachers I ever have. The class is not hard if you just do the work and pay attention. You will actually learn something if you give the class a chance. I love Reneta!
7264,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HADM105,2.5,4.0,"Just do not bring food or drink into the class room, and if you do, surrender it when she asks.  This one girl argued with her when Reneta tried to take her tea, claiming it was ""water with tea in it.""  Renita would have drop kicked her if the class wasnt full of witnesses"
7265,182096,Reneta,McCarthy,Cornell University,Business,HA408,4.5,2.0,"Take the casinos class if you can, guarantee it will be a blast"
7267,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1120,4.0,4.0,"Professor Conelly dresses like a wizard, and is extremely well respected. His lectures were tad boring and were not well organised but, he is good during OH when you come with specific questions. The HW given was tough, but he offered OH 4 times a week. He is extremely caring, especially during the COVID crisis, he made stuff more lenient for us"
7268,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MAP2302,5.0,3.0,"Robert Connelly is one of those rare instructors who really cares about his students. He cares about your success and the knowledge you take away from his class. I took ODE with him and although he doesn't make the class easy, he doesn't make it difficult either. Just show up, do the homework, and take the class seriously. 11/10 would recommend."
7269,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,1.0,5.0,"Really just a terrible professor. The only thing that saved this course was that another teacher for the course and the TAs in the course were trying to make the tests at least somewhat reasonable and allow students to pass. Were it not for the help of my TA's, I would have failed this course and learned nothing because Connelly is that bad."
7270,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2220,1.0,5.0,"Terrible lecturer.  He's obviously a brilliant mathematician, but he cannot for the life of him explain even simple concepts. Lectures are completely disorganized, and he makes tons of mistakes in examples. He probably makes sense to people to whom math comes intuitively, but for 90% of the class this isn't the case. Exams were ridiculously hard"
7271,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH7510,5.0,4.0,"Professor Connelly is the greatest teacher I have had, and takes a genuine interest in the success of his students in and beyond class. He is one of the most respected topologists in the country, and he uses his reputation to benefit his students. Plus, he looks dresses like a mystical wizard of math!"
7272,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.0,4.0,"Makes several mistakes and is known as ""Goth Moses"" by among the students. Lectures are essentially useless... READ THE BOOK"
7273,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.0,4.0,"To be fair I came into this class with prior experience in multivar. He does a great job conveying the eloquence behind the theorems being taught but he's not the best at teaching basics, which is tough if this is your first exposure to the material. Beyond 1920, hes incredibly accomplished (check wikipedia) and wears great outfits so thats cool."
7274,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,2.0,4.0,Have to use the textbook to learn the material well.
7275,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2310,4.0,4.0,"Sometimes has a tough time communicating exactly what he is trying to say, but gets the job done at the end of the day. Very understanding and super generous with final grades. Bomb a prelim? It's okay if you do good on the final he'll bump you up at around a B"
7276,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH3040,3.0,1.0,Connelly is one the few gems of the mathematics department. His wit and intellect is unmatched. And don't get me started on his fashion! So bold and progressive! A true academic!
7277,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2310,1.0,5.0,"Literally an atrocious professor.  Made absolutely no sense, frequently made mistakes in lecture, teaches straight out of the textbook which is also horrendous and he doesnt understand either, and is terrible at judging when the class is or is not following the lecture. Just watch the online lectures with Strang at MIT, start praying, and drop."
7278,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH7510,4.0,4.0,"Going to Bob Connelly's office hours is a privilege that increased my understanding of mathematics by orders of magnitude. Doing proofs with him on the board is a humbling experience, because he is supremely gifted, but the benefit of the experience more than makes up for the blow to your ego."
7279,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.5,4.0,Connelly frequently made mistakes on the board while lecturing.  He is not a clear lecturer.  Class would have been significantly easier if I knew what was going on.
7280,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,3040,4.5,2.0,"Prove it was a small class and it's really a gentle introduction to higher level maths. Covers basic analysis, algebra, and geometry with a lot of emphasis on writing the proofs correctly and with good style. Office hours helpful, used an online textbook."
7281,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.5,3.0,"As others have said, Connelly is a boring lecturer. His examples were all theoretical and not what we would see on homework nor tests. He basically teaches right out of the textbook. He did seem to improve throughout the semester, however, which is good, because it implies that he does listen to student feedback, but by then, it was too late."
7282,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.0,3.0,"Connelly is a nice guy, but not the best teacher. I started going to the other professor's lectures after the first few weeks. The hardest part of 1920 is the volume of material they expect you to learn, so make sure you stay caught up and its much more manageable. Multi is actually pretty cool but unfortunately they don't present it the best way. "
7283,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.0,1.0,"His lectures are littered with mistakes, and I genuinely think I learned less by going to them. I stopped going to them half way through the semester and my results were the same. Luckily, MATH1920 is a really easy class now since they got rid of prelims."
7284,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.0,5.0,"He tries... but that's not saying much. He will teach material incorrectly, and he constantly asks students if he made a mistake."
7285,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.0,5.0,Literally and figuratively the worst math teacher I have ever had.
7286,235603,Robert,Connelly,Cornell University,Mathematics,1920,1.0,5.0,"Terrible, inadequate teacher. He definitely does try, but he is always unable to convey anything without making tons of mistakes.  I used to love math in high school. Connelly singlehandedly killed my interest in mathematics."
7288,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,4.0,This guy's great.  Had him for both 1920 and 2940.  I've never seen someone have so much fun talking about math.
7289,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH2940,5.0,4.0,Excellent Lecturer. Engaging with the class; has a few quirky jokes every class. Grade is over 80% based on tests and quizzes.
7290,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4370,5.0,4.0,Might be the smartest guy I have ever met. His lectures are clear and very worth showing up to.
7291,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,3.0,"Great professor, lectures are very clear and funny."
7292,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,3.0,"Multi was hard for me. I had morning classes. It was bad. However, Stillman's lectures are not only fairly organized and clear, he made calculus entertaining. He's incredibly friendly and approachable and always willing to offer help.   1920 might have been a hard math class, but Stillman made it bearable. I highly recommend."
7293,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,3.5,3.0,Stillman was a good lecturer although I didn't really find his lectures useful for some of the topics. Overall a really nice guy and very enthusiastic.
7294,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,2.0,"Professor Stillman's lectures are clear, organized, and often entertaining. There are problem sets due every week, though they are never arduous, and he has regular office hours for those who need help. Overall, a great course taught by a great professor."
7295,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,3.0,Lectures are very clear and well organized. The material is difficult but he does a very good job of stepping through each concept. Prelims are fair and you'll be fine as long as you're comfortable with the homework.
7296,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH4370,4.5,3.0,Prof. Stillman is a great professor and made computational algebra very interesting
7297,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,3.0,"Stillman's lectures were generally well organized and engaging. He is very funny and approachable in and out of class. Some homework and exam problems, however, were extremely challenging and a level beyond the material covered in class."
7298,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,1.5,3.0,"Read the txtbk before you come to class. If you ask him how he got a number to try out, he will say ""by intuition"". I learned straight from the txtbk but his examples in class and test questions were much harder. He is nice and funny though! He's just really bad at explaining stuff. Study well and study hard or just be born knowing the stuff"
7299,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, really enjoyed his lectures. Professor Stillman had terrific in class examples that very well explained concepts and was helpful in office hours as well. Textbook examples reinforced what I learned in class, but his lectures really helped me understand the concepts."
7300,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,4.0,"Best Professor this past semester, and probably one of the best at Cornell. Explained topics clearly, kept lectures engaging with his enthusiasm, jokes, and Little Johnny problems. Definitely take this class with Stillman!"
7301,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.0,2.0,Probably the best professor I had this semester.
7302,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,4.5,4.0,"Great professor, interesting lectures. One of the best classes I've taken at Cornell."
7303,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,3.0,"I took this class about a year ago, and it still has been my favorite class at Cornell. One reason is definitely Stillman taught this course. He explained everything so clearly especially when he used models in physics to give the abstract math terms lots of intuition thoughts. He is also a most accessible prof. He replies emails very politely also"
7304,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,4.0,"Stillman is an excellent professor and a great guy.He explains topics clearly, lets us ask questions and makes the class engaging (gives examples about Little Johnny). He is very helpful in office hours. You have to take this class! Probably the best math class you will take!"
7305,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,1.0,"Stillman is probably one of the best math professors you can have at Cornell.  His lectures are very clear, homework is completely doable, and office hours are super useful. He is a fantastic guy and his constant ""Little Johnny"" examples are a great way to make sure you're paying  attention. Take him at all costs! You won't regret it!"
7306,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,3.0,Take him. Do whatever you can to do so!!!
7307,489351,Michael,Stillman,Cornell University,Mathematics,MATH1920,5.0,3.0,"Excellent Professor. The concepts, especially toward the second half of the class, are difficult to grasp but Stillman was enthusiastic and creative in his approach of teaching the material - making it easier to comprehend. It's also amusing how he always uses the same character, Little Johnny, in his crazy examples."
7309,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Hazan is an amazing lecturer- extremely funny and engaging. Human Bonding is the best class I have ever taken. Beware: it is really difficult to get a spot in her class as an underclassman because it's so popular. Also, her TA's graded really harshly, but I still got an A with curving. Entire grade is based on 2 tests, but interesting material"
7310,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HUMAN BONDING! Such a great class, the material is super interesting (love, relationships, etc.) Don't skip the lecturesthat's the best part of the class! Get a study group before the prelims, they're straightforward, but cover a lot of material. Really cool class and great professor."
7311,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,2.0,"You will walk out of this class with knowledge that you will use for the rest of your life. If you're in a relationship or ever plan on being in one, this class is incredibly insightful. Lectures feel like TED talks, they're fun and laid back. No homework, just study for the exams and do the readings (short, interesting) the night before."
7312,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,2.0,"Hands down the greatest professor, and greatest class, I've taken at Cornell. If you can take this course, 100% do."
7313,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,4.0,"Professor Hazan is loved by everyone, and for good reason. She's interesting, kind, funny, and much more. The tests can be graded harsher thank you might expect, but don't let this deter you from taking this class (there's no homework so all you have to do is study). One of my favorite lecturers--and she has a really soothing voice!"
7314,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,2.0,Best professor ever!
7315,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,2.0,"One of Cornell's most beloved classes, taught by one of its most beloved professors. Engaging lectures, fascinating material, and Hazan really values student questions and input. Also has a wonderful sense of humor and you can tell she's really passionate about her subject."

7318,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,2.0,"One of the best profs I've had in Cornell. Clearly interested in her research and unbashedly shares that enthusiasm with the class. Is very approachable and friendly so don't afraid to go up and ask her questions. TAs are also very professional. Prelims can be tricky but the final makes up for it . Take the class with prof, you wont regret it!"
7319,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,3.0,1.0,"Straightforward but interesting subject matter, engaging lectures. Takenotes very useful for exams. Only complaint is that exams were incredibly specific on lectures and readings, i.e. sometimes not focusing on main idea of reading but more on tedious details. Nit-picky grading on exams. Not 'easy A' unless you are good at studying/ test taking"
7320,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,4.5,2.0,"Excellent course: simply put, a must take. Hazan is a great professor and researcher with information-packed and engaging lectures. Multiple choice questions on prelims can be tough, but tests overall are very fair. Don't do the readings until the outline comes out because only certain sections are required. Also, the final was about 80% repeats!"
7321,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,3.0,"best professor I have ever had at Cornell, and my favorite class. She knows how to give a lecture, they are very entertaining with so much useful information. Her tests are hard, make sure you do all of the readings. Given that, she is very enjoyable and you can go to her office hours and ask any question about relationships. highly recommended"
7322,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,3.0,2.0,A bit disorganized and scattered in some lectures. Good overall.
7323,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,4.5,3.0,"The best professor I've ever had at Cornell. Her class is not easy, but if you work hard it's incredibly rewarding and you learn a lot. Tests can be difficult, but her amazing teaching style definitely makes the class worth it!"

I was always really excited to go in and learn. I should note that there are certain concepts that she really beats into the ground, but she is sweet enough that it makes up for it. Go up and talk to her after class!"
7326,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,3.5,4.0,"While the material for this class was interesting, the exams were completely unfair. The tests are ridiculously specific and the TA's do not grade the exams fairly (even though it takes them about 3 weeks to grade them anyway). Must memorize a lot of information and even if you read the entire book, there is no guarantee that you'll do well."
7327,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD3620,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor! One of my favorite classes at Cornell!!  But the tests are specific so studying and reading the assignments is a must
7328,192515,Cindy,Hazan,Cornell University,Psychology,HD362,4.5,3.0,"Amazing prof. and human being. I always left her class feeling inspired about human relationships. It's a very feel-good class, and one of the most popular. It actually has helped me in my own romantic relationship tremendously. I think all human beings should be required to take this class. On a side note, though, take time to study for the tests!"
7329,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,4.0,Great guy - I like how he was always willing to help. Loves chemistry and teaching.
7330,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,3.0,"Professor Coates is one of the best lecturers at Cornell, and certainly does a great job teaching organic chemistry. He is extremely clear and organized, and is genuinely one of the nicest professors you will meet. His research focuses on polymer synthesis (and he's extremely good at it), so know those polymers and transition metal catalysts!"
7331,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,4.0,"this prof views his role as an enabler, not a gatekeeper. no doubt this is a hard class, but the lectures are clear and organized. the Friday help sessions are amazingly helpful - relaxed informal setting. first exam was more than fair - if you attend lecture and do the homework you should do well. TAs are all very helpful. "
7332,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,3.0,One of the greatest lecturer who knows the material and knows how to explain them. Never fell asleep because his explanations were golden. And his my advisor and is a very down to earth person. I'm glad I had him for orgo.
7333,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,4.0,"Arguably one of the best professors I've had yet at Cornell. Coates is the man. He is very clear and organized in his lectures (and often funny), and he wants to see you do well. Difficult course in general due to the material, but much more bearable with Coates. Very down to earth guy. I highly recommend him."
7334,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,4.0,4.0,Hes fun and nice. The class is hard.
7335,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHM358,5.0,5.0,Great course by a dedicated prof. Nuff said.
7336,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM357,4.0,3.0,Prof Coates is my favorite teacher at Cornell so far.  He was a great guy and teacher.  He genuinely cared about teaching the students and has a great personality while lecturing. =)  Very much recommended for Orgo.
7337,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,5.0,5.0,"Absolutely great prof. ZVery challenging, but can be conquered if you attend classes and do the homework. Exam averages are ~60 - don't believe the ""too easy"" banter!"
7338,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,3.0,5.0,"Not a bad orgo prof. His voice is kind of boring and it makes you want to go to sleep. The man does have a thing for polymers and by the end of the course, you're gonna need to know, like, 600 reactions.Regardless of the professor, orgo is still gonna be hard. So BEWARE of all all these high ratings! Good LUck!"
7339,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,5.0,3.0,Just Awesome!  Study hard and it should pay off.
7340,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,1.0,1.0,"Way easier than any other Chem course! Total ""make it easy so they like me"" guy."
7341,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,4.5,5.0,"Very amusing, friendly professor. His tests were fair, but still very difficult. His lectures were very clear and his demos were awesome. Ganem never had demos..."
7342,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,4.0,4.0,"Probably about as good as orgo can be: clear lectures and fair tests. Both in terms of knowledge learned and grades achieved, you get what you put into this class; just study hard and pay attention to lecture. Also seems like a pretty nice person out of class."
7343,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,5.0,3.0,"I love his lectures, so easy to follow.  He's so willing to help the students, not bring them down like some premed courses do.  I don't know if he's a good person, though, after a certain incident in lecture.  But, that doesn't affect his teaching.  He's a great TEACH-er."
7344,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,5.0,3.0,"PROFESSOR COATES IS THE BEST SCIENCE PROFF I HAVE HAD EVER ! he makes the classss sooo much fun .. he is a kind guy with a lovely personality .. he is extremely helpful in any way and cornell is luck to have him ! i luv organic chem cause of him . his test are VERY FAIR .. and yes.. if u think they are hard,,, u need to be working harder!"
7345,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,5.0,3.0,"ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS I HAVE COME ACROSS AT CORNELL...EVER PERIOD. HE IS FROM THE WEST COAST, AND HE IS VERY LAID BACK AND COOL ABOUT ORGO CHEM. HE MAKES A USUALLY STRESSFUL CLASS, FUN AND VERY INTERESTING. DEFINITELY TAKE HIS CLASS :)"
7346,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,5.0,3.0,"very nice guy. almost like a dad. :).lectures are important cause he takes stuff directly offf off them for exams.problem seys are so much earsier then for 357. tests are VERY FAIR and if you think they are hard, then u need to be working harder. seems to be easier than 357. moves slower than 357 . lovely personality !"
7347,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,3.5,2.0,"A good teacher. Not as good as Ruttlege, but his tests were easier (note: this doesn't mean the curve gets any easier!). Also, he follows the book more consistently than does Ruttlege, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it. Overall, I really enjoyed him as a teacher, even if he's not as hilarious as Ruttlege."
7348,191849,Geoff,Coates,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,5.0,4.0,"Well, I wouldn't say this was easy, with exam scores in the single digits. However the tests were very fair, with questins ranging from easy mult choice to nearly impossible 'make the molecule'. Lookin back, I feel I learned alot about the stuff around us is made. Coates was very clear about the materialand his expectations. Great course. Nuff said"
7350,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,4.0,"AMAZING PROF! I can't imagine having learned biochem from anyone else. Clearly covers difficult concepts, so helpful and welcoming during office hours even just to chat about non biochem related topics. So sad he is retiring from teaching, one of the best!"
7351,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,1.0,5.0,The lectures and slides in this class were so confusing. They left me super frustrated and I always felt like I had to learn the material entirely by myself.
7352,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,4.0,Very kind and attentive professor. Lecture guide is detailed.
7353,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,4.0,4.0,"Very traditional, straightforward lecturer. The lectures aren't mandatory, and basically a transcript of what he says is put on blackboard (I found studying those to be most helpful, although his lecture guide is pretty good as well). As difficult as you would expect a biochem class to be, but not unreasonable, and a very nice lecturer"
7354,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,2.0,5.0,"This class is extremely difficult. Not only are the lectures super boring and the lecture guide extremely confusing, but the material we are expected to learn is just unreasonably specific and unnecessary. This quizzes every week are a huge pain and you don't feel like you are actually getting anything out of them. Also he's like really mean."
7355,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,1.0,4.0,hes sooooo mean lmao ive written three reviews and none of them have come up. guy is a terrible guy who yells at students and other cornell faculty. disrespectful and fake nice
7356,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,4.0,"Professor Feigenson really cares about his students! He sent out email to students who did well on the midterm and actually congratulated them! He also held weekly optional discussion, pls go to those if you have time. They are super helpful!"
7357,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,3.0,"Just received a pretty good grade on my midterm, and Jerry goes out of his way to send me an email tO CONGRATULATE ME FOR MY SUCCESS. What an awesome guy."
7358,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,3310,5.0,3.0,Incredible professor and individual. He genuinely cares about his students and their performance in his class. He's super clear and efficient too. I know some students who didn't go to some lectures but that's stupid. Don't skip ANY lectures. There is a LOT that you have to know for the weekly quizzes and especially the final.
7359,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,2.0,"The greatest professor at Cornell and probably in all of New York state in the sciences. He genuinely wants for you to succeed - if you have a suggestion for the class, he'll weigh it and do it. He holds sessions for help applying to med school weekly. He lets you decide how the class will be graded and he tells you what will be asked on each test."
7360,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Feigenson was, by far, my favorite professor at Cornell. You will not find anyone more astute, approachable, and devoted to his students . The format of BIOMG 3310 is incredibly conducive to learning. At the end of every lecture, he goes out of his way to tell you what you need to know AND what you don't."
7361,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,3.5,3.0,This professor made me miserable.  I could not follow his lectures and he focused on equations and minute details rather than teaching us central concepts.  The one time I spoke to him outside of class he was very intense and kept repeating that I should have known something.  I left his office crying.  I simply stopped going to lecture.
7362,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,3.0,"Gerry is the only professor I have ever had that actually goes way out of his way to help his students, even long after they are taking a class with him. While the course is not a breeze, he is such a truly good human being that I would absolutely recommend taking his class and not being afraid to ask him for advice on just about anything."
7363,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3310,5.0,1.0,"feigenson is definitely for the students, as the reviewer before me said. He is very approachable and you can just tell he cares A LOT about his students. He's very helpful in office hours, not condescending, and tries really hard to get to know his students. But, i felt like I was memorizing answers more so than actually learning in his class"
7364,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BBM3310,5.0,4.0,"Feigenson is one of the best teacher at cornell. He is so approachable. He is FOR THE STUDENTS. He goes out of his way for his students. Very good lecturer, very knowledgeable about the field. His Friday sessions are really good, I recommend that everyone should go! Very nice guy. This course really stimulated my interest in Biochem.TAKE HIS CLASS!"
7365,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM3310,5.0,1.0,"Definitely he is the best professor i ever had. If you ever get to know him well, he is one of the most nicest people ever. He is a great help for med school application and he loves his students."
7366,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM3310,5.0,3.0,Great lecturer
7367,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM331,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor who genuinely cares about teaching. His passion for the subject really shows during lectures and simplifies a lot of stuff so very understandable and intersting as well. Surprisingly low amount of memorization required. way to an A: master lecture notes(understanding is the key), do previous quizes. you're set and done."
7368,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM331,5.0,4.0,"Feigenson is fantastic.  You can tell he puts a ton into this class, from the separate word files he creates for the lecture notes to the silly little overheads he prepares and manipulates with forceps.  Great prof."
7369,28520,Gerald,Feigenson,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM331,5.0,4.0,"I would not be where I was in my life today without Dr F.  I'm now almost done medical school, and his course REALLY helped... and his extra 'seminars on life' are very worthwhile:  he gave me a sense of focus and direction again.  Very inspiring and changed my life."
7371,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3300,5.0,4.0,"This course is great, and the material is very interesting and applicable. The auto-tutorial format is well suited because biochem in general is memorization heavy. Jim is available to answer questions, and he has a great teaching team to help out. His review sessions are great too, and he's a sweet person who loves teaching!"
7372,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3300,5.0,4.0,He is very dedicated to all students. Exercises tough love.
7373,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3300,1.0,3.0,"Auto tutorial classes substitute genuine educators for student laborers, bulk memorization, and arbitrary weekly assessments. Any student that says that they enjoy this kind of pseudo-learning must, in fact, detest learning and instead be enjoying the mindless parroting of uncontextualized information. BIOMG 3300 is definetly not worth your time"
7374,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3300,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed 3300; one of my favorite courses at Cornell
7375,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3300,5.0,2.0,"Makes mud as clear as water. Excellent professor! His review sessions are short and sweet. Material can seem a little heavy, but is actually not that bad, especially with all the tons of help he and his assistants offer. Always wandering the study center asking if students need help with material, and asks for feedback on quizzes and tests."
7376,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3350,4.0,5.0,Awesome class! Jim is really cool.
7377,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOCH1,5.0,3.0,"BEST CLASS I loved biochemistry, and I loved his teaching method. He knows what he's talking about, and wants you to learn!"
7378,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3300,5.0,4.0,"Doing well on the weekly quizzes will take up hours each week.  However, studying for quizzes makes studying for prelims relatively  easy and the material you learn in this class come back again and again in many other science classes and especially the MCAT.  I've learned more in this class than any other at Cornell, but be prepared to work for it"
7379,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOMG3300,4.5,4.0,"Autotutorial biochem was very difficult in terms of material that you must learn.  However, there are always TAs on staff to help you out during the day.  Prof. Blankenship gives optional lectures, which can be helpful.  He was one of my favorite lecturers, which really says something, since this was an autotutorial course."
7380,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM4320,4.5,3.0,"took this molecular cell bio. class during the summer during the 6 week session. if you can, take it! covering something as deep as cell bio in 6 weeks means at least 25+ hours of work per week for each of the 6 weeks, but if you keep up, you will be rewarded with a wealth of knowledge. Also, there were only 4 people in the class- amazing."
7381,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM3300,4.5,4.0,"This is a hard course heavy on information. Yet, Jim made it one of the most fair, interesting, and rewarding classes I have taken at Cornell. I did not enjoy ""hard"" science until I took this class. Key to success is simple: study the objectives (exactly what is on prelims.)It's unfortunate Jim doesn't teach a lecture class, he would be brilliant."
7382,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM3300,4.5,4.0,"Autotutorial biochemistry is no cakewalk, but Jim outlines exactly what he wants you to know in the course packet.  If you study those objectives and know them by heart, you'll do well.  Unlike orgo, you can actually get a good grade if you put in lots of effort."
7383,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,4.0,5.0,The autotutorial class is so absurdly hard I bled a little. I still enjoyed the material and learned a lot. The prof constructed a really solid challenging class.
7384,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,5.0,4.0,"You will remember this class for your entire life. Excellent auto-tutorial course. The optional ""review"" sessions led by Jim are good refreshers for exams or before Unit tests. Workload=life consuming. Talk to TAs in the center and clear questions up ASAP. Jim is always in the center helping TAs with unit test, grading, tutoring."
7385,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,5.0,3.0,"Best autotutorial class at Cornell. Possibly best Biology class. Jim is clear and organized and WANTS YOU TO DO WELL. Class is organized around this basic motive, so oral tests are not graded, written tests are fair, and prelims are very fair too! No complaints. The material was really interesting too. Workload not too bad."
7386,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,3.5,4.0,"Like with most auto classes, what you get out is directly correlated to how much time and effort you put into it - you can get a lot of out this class by learning the material thoroughly. Didn't  have a lot of contact with the prof, but his review sessions were great and he seemed accessible and helpful. Actually one of my favorite classes here."
7387,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,5.0,5.0,"This class has a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge workload, but in the end you learn alot and it's pretty interesting.  The prof was helpful and nice."
7388,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,4.0,4.0,"In BioBm330, I didnt have too much contact with Jim. The class itself was very intense and rigorous. You dont have to wake up for lecture and you can skip material you already know, but reading text book alone can be depressing sometimes. You dont have to read the text book, just *memorize* the objectives, good way to develop study habits."
7389,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,3.0,3.0,"He's an ok guy, personally though, I thought he was sorta condescending to certain students at times- so for that I think the guy is a bit of an ass.  I'm guessing all these great reviews he's getting are from his ""favorite"" students.  Review sessions were helpful though, the test were hard but if you studied you would do fine."
7390,100797,Jim,Blankenship,Cornell University,Science,BIOBM330,5.0,2.0,He should be a professor teaching a Real class.
7392,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,3.0,"EDA is an essential class for any Cornell student, and Christina is an excellent professor. That is all that needs to be said."
7393,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,HADM1740,5.0,3.0,"Christina is amazing! She's funny, helpful, and cares about her students. I took business computing with her and mark and I did well because she provided us everything we needed for exercises. Attendance is mandatory. I'd love to take another course with her."
7394,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,2.0,"Super helpful class that can be an easy class, but don't underestimate it. Make sure you are well prepared for the two in class excel quizzes and you should be fine."
7395,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,3.0,I highly recommend taking EDA with Christina. The content is really useful and she makes the lectures interesting. She's also super nice and approachable. 10/10.
7396,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,HADM2740,5.0,3.0,"Christina is one of the best professors at Cornell, she puts a lot of work into making lectures applicable to the real world while maintaining a great attitude. Always makes expectations clear, connects with students, and is careful to explain things in a very clear manner to reduce potential for confusion. Take her lab for Business Computing!"
7397,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,1.0,"Amazing class do not regret it at all, have learned a lot of useful things in this class"
7398,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,2.0,EDA is by far the most applicable course offered at Cornell. Christina teaches skills that are necessary for most jobs that ILR students have. She makes class really fun and rewarding. Easy A if you practice the techniques. This class is a must-take for all ILR students.
7399,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,HADM1740,5.0,3.0,She's a great lecturer. I enjoyed her. Some didn't but I guess it's just about how you mesh with a professor sometimes. The structure of the class was terrible but there were four professors responsible for it so can't put it all on her.
7400,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR4695,5.0,2.0,"So blessed to have taken all three of her classes: EDA, ADA and XDA. The Expert Certification in Microsoft Excel is a nice resume booster, but even more valuable are the actual skills she teaches so well. I now use Excel for everything from tracking income/expenses to creating charts and graphs for various purposes. Couldn't recommend enough"
7401,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,3.0,I am so thankful that I had a Christina as a teacher for EDA. I now graduated and she is even willing to help with a excel-based work assignment that I have been struggling with. She genuinely cares about her students and this class is the most useful class that I have taken throughout my time at Cornell.
7402,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRLR2660,5.0,2.0,She does a good job with this course that ends up being very valuable. Would definitely recommend.
7403,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR6990,5.0,3.0,"Undoubtedly one of the best professors at Cornell. ADA was a little harder than EDA, and the skills that she teaches you are prob the most applicable. She is a little frank, but far from rude. The comment about her being rude is absurd; she treats you like you treat her. If you disrespect her, she'll give you no respect back. Try a little, easy A"
7404,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,1.0,4.0,Easy class and useful but was taken back by her rudeness... would recommend taking another desktop/excel/ microsoft class if you do not want to be hurt.
7405,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,3.0,3.0,"Her class is not difficult and if your willing to work hard then an A is easily obtainable, but this is not a course you can blow off and do well. She also is not as reasonable as others have suggested, she is down to earth, but there are no second chances in her course if you make one mistake on a test you put yourself out of the A range."
7406,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,1.0,"Christina Homrighouse is one of the most entertaining lecturers I've had to date. You literally cannot fail if you just show up, listen, and follow instructions. I had experience in Excel/Powerpoint before the class and that only made it easier."
7407,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,HADM1740,5.0,3.0,"Christina is the best business computing professor you can have. She cares about her students, 100%."
7408,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,1.0,Christina is a phenomenal teacher. She knows her stuff and she is willing to work with students who may be struggling. Christina cares about her students and wants them all to succeed if they put in the required amount of effort. I recommend going to every class and taking notes. Excel will help you not only at Cornell but well afterwards.
7409,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,2.0,One of the most understanding professors I have ever had. She is straightforward and truly cares about helping you succeed. She is also HILARIOUS and makes class fun. If you miss lecture make sure to attend one of the other lectures that week or else you will fall behind very quickly. Tests are easy if you pay attention in class.
7410,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,2.0,"Great class, great professor."
7411,129807,Christina,Homrighouse,Cornell University,Industrial Studies,ILRHR2660,5.0,1.0,"There is absolutely no excuse not to take her class if you are in ILR. Not only is the subject matter essential to your future success, but the course itself is very well instructed by a professor who genuinely cares for her students."
7412,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,5.0,5.0,"Awesome teacher. Was my favorite class last year. He goes through the material pretty quickly so make sure to pay attention. If you don't want to rapidly write down notes, I would recommend buying the Take Note. Overall hilarious guy though."
7413,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,2604,1.5,4.0,"Would not recommend class if you think it's going to be an easy A. Lectures are boring and the readings are tedious. He will ask obscure questions on the exams to try to trick you. Only three exams, which is good or bad. Mankin is also not the nicest guy and is not much help outside of lecture."
7414,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,4.0,3.0,"Mankin is a boss. His tests can be hard if you don't do the reading and aren't up to the task of memorizing facts. If you think you know Greek mythology from high school so you can just waltz in and get an A, you would be wrong. His class was one of my favorites at Cornell and I would take it again in a heartbeat. Must take before graduation."
7415,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,GREEKMYTH,5.0,2.0,"Such a boss with those glasses. Great teacher, and a very fair grader. Take a course with him if you've got a chance!"
7416,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,3.0,1.0,"Class is easy in the sense that if you were someone who gets good grades, you will find this class to be much much easier to get an A+/A than other classes where you prolly study much more to get an A/A-. Coming from a science major, so if u r humanities, this is prolly easy A+ for u."
7417,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,4.0,3.0,"not an easy class, maybe it used to be though. even if you do all the readings, the questions are sometimes so specific. you definitely have to work for an A- or A, even with the bonus points he gives out for tricky questions afterwards."
7418,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,3.0,5.0,not sure why so many people here are saying that it's an easy class. Not true at all. You can do the readings and still come up short on the exams. not an easy class.
7419,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,4.0,1.0,"He didn't teach much but I did learn some things. I was able to follow him pretty well. I was never bored. He makes awful jokes but he always means well. Exams are super easy if you do all the readings. A few times I couldn't finish the sections on time I used sparknotes, they helped but not much."
7420,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,2.5,2.0,"Professor Mankin is a very relaxed Professor though it is very clear that he doesn't care if you come to class or if you actually want to learn something. The lectures are extremely dry and there is no apparent structure to any of them so I didn't find them worth going. 3 multiple choice prelims (dug deep into details), no final, optional paper."
7421,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLAS2604,2.5,1.0,"Nice guy with interesting take on Greek Mythology, but consistently insults himself and complains about Cornell University, as well as what he is allowed to say in class. Seems as though he is simply accepting the fact that people do not take his class seriously, and that is a bit discouraging to see as a student. Easy A though if you're into that."
7422,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLAS2604,4.5,3.0,"He's a little strange, but he is more than willing to respond to emails quickly and is quite easy when it comes to grading, assuming you read the works.  He can be a little hard to follow in class but he has a really interesting take on a typically dry subject."
7423,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,1.0,3.0,worst class ive ever taken. a ton of reading on a bunch of crap no one cares about. not as easy as you probably think.
7424,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,2.0,2.0,"How anyone can actually learn from this class or enjoy his incoherent ramblings is beyond me. Even the takenote for the class is convoluted because of his rants and constantly contradicting sidenotes. Really guys? This class is by far the least educational, least resourceful, and least legitimate class at cornell. (and i've taken every easy a here)"
7425,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLAS2612,3.0,2.0,"So hard to pay attention most of the time. Many test questions were devoted to if you remembered what the english translation for latin terms were, which was stupid. Once I got the takenote I completely stopped going to class. Not worth your time. Take a class with professor Ahl and actually learn something"
7426,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,LATIN1205,3.0,4.0,"Latin is not a particularly easy language, and Mankin doesn't make it any easier. While Mankin is hilarious and outrageous, he makes little effort to actually teach.  He doesn't hold office hours, so you're left with asking him questions (however basic) in class.  But when you do ask questions, he rails on you for 10 minutes about being an idiot."
7427,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,4.0,1.0,"One of the best classes I've taken! Lectures were a lot of fun. Mankin's pretty laidback, but he understands students' concern over grades and explains the grading for everything. There was a lot of reading, but if you did them and memorized what he assigned, the exams were really easy. He's funny and definitely knows his stuff. An easy A!"
7428,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLAS2604,3.5,2.0,"Post below is right about his boss-ness and spitefulness. All of the work comes right before the two exams, when you have to do a lot of reading (expecially the final) in order to answer sometimes niche/specific multiple choice questions. Tests are curved generously though. Pretty Easy."
7430,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLAS264,3.5,2.0,"although he's such a boss with his RayBan wayfarers, he grew increasingly annoying with his open spitefulness towards Cornell, students, and everything else in life.But he does know his stuff. Not exactly the best prof out there though. Don't be fooled - Be prepared to do lots of reading - he's increased it by a lot, trying to make the class legit."
7431,321169,David,Mankin,Cornell University,Humanities,CLASS2604,5.0,1.0,Professor Mankin is great! One of the best professors I've had here at Cornell.  His class is easy but you actually learn a lot.  Attendance is not mandatory but people come anyways because class is fun and interesting!
7432,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2100,1.0,5.0,"No discussion section when you can barely do well in the class without one. Everyone I know was struggling and if you don't understand, it's always your fault even if there are virtually no resources. There are TA's, but they move their office hours every single week so it's inconsistent. Take this class or this teacher if you want a headache."
7433,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2100,3.0,4.0,"Lots of structure, lots of redundant work. Its a tough course but you learn a lot. Jack has little patience, but hes a nice guy and wants you to do well. There are some minor issues with materials, but far less than in past years it would seem. This is dependent on TAs. Sections are boring but good for learning."
7434,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2225,1.0,4.0,"Not looking to enhance a students learning experience. Takes opportunities to call out specifics students in front of the class. Not a good guy, not a good teacher."
7435,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2100,1.0,2.0,"Curriculum materials are not updated to work with the new edition of the textbook.  Lectures are dry and boring. Textbook is also very expensive. I eventually switched to Hotel School's course, which turned out to be better. You will get more attention from teaching assistants in Hotel."
7436,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,1.0,2.0,"Really does not know the materials. The instructor got his CPA with bare minimum passing score (300/400), or getting 75% each section of four exams. He made numerous mistakes, and when I asked questions in office hours, he was not able to give clear answers to some of them."
7437,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM323,1.0,1.0,"Compared to other courses I have taken at Cornell, my experience with this professor is definitely sub-standard. On several occasions he did not act professionally (discourteous) and took students' questions with a certain degree of ""looking down"" attitude. Moreover, curriculum is very outdated and has not changed much, containing numerous errors."
7438,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,4.0,4.0,Really knows what he is talking about but lecture can be boring. Class depends on doing and understanding the homework. Nice guy
7439,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2225,5.0,3.0,"He is a really good lecturer and makes accessing very clear and simple. Very nice guy and always willing to help. The class feels like a bunch of busy work but it is all in preparation for the prelims, which are not that easy. Nothing bad I can say about the class. Basically the same class as AEM 2210, AEM2225 is just the AEM major version."
7440,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,1.0,3.0,"Homework/Section/Demo materials include errors. Sections are mandatory and excessively long. There are lots of duplicates - online homework, online quizzes, and paper-and-pencil homework. It is an overkill to do all three.  A lot of materials towards the end of course are actually intermediate level, so it is unnecessarily advanced."
7441,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, clear, fair, and direct. Good lecturer and honestly interested in helping you learn the material."
7442,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,5.0,3.0,"Given the fact that this was an accounting class (very dry material), Prof did a great job making it interesting. Very personable and good lecturer, the entire course is designed to teach you accounting by doing it, very well structured in my opinion. Great professor."
7443,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,5.0,2.0,"The class was really boring, but Professor Little was such a great guy and offered so many resources that really helped me get through the semester. Super helpful in office hours. If you have to take Accounting, take it with him."
7444,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,5.0,3.0,Little is awesome. He really cares about his students and he does an excellent job explaining concepts.
7445,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,2.0,4.0,This class is extremely boring. Lectures are boring sections are mandatory and boring. Keep up with the work in order to do well but your near certain lack of interest in the course may prevent you from achieving your desired grade nonetheless
7446,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2100,5.0,2.0,"Without a doubt the best professor I have had to date at Cornell. Clear and precise, fair tests and workloads."
7447,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,5.0,2.0,"I really liked Jack as a professor- he's very no-nonsense and wants you to learn accounting. He gives you tons of practice problems- do them all and there shouldn't be any surprises on the exams. The sections are helpful if you have good TAs, homework doesn't take too long, overall a really good class."
7448,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,3.0,3.0,"If you don't like accounting, then you'll find this class boring as I did.  The textbook was my lifesaver since I personally found lecture to be tedious.  The prelims are fair but the final was harder than expected.  Don't fall behind in this class and you'll do fine."
7449,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,4.5,2.0,I absolutely loved this class. I got an A by paying attention in class and doing the homework. Prelims are fair and not very challenging. Highly recommend.
7450,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,3.5,2.0,"Little expects his students to read the book before his lectures. People who don't adapt to this early may have problems later in the course since most of the material is based on a few fundamental concepts. Lecture isn't necessary, but it's nice for clarifying little nuances. Most of your learning will come from doing the actual accounting."
7451,489024,John,Little,Cornell University,Accounting,AEM2210,2.5,1.0,"Easy class overall but, more often than not, the homework/section/demo problems would contain significant errors. Often, after spending hours trying to get the hw problems to work out, I would come to section and find out that we were given the wrong numbers. This was nearly every week. VERY frustrating when trying to do homework or study for tests"
7453,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,1.0,4.0,Terrible person. I was hospitalized for a week and she forced me to use all of my slip days instead of just granting an extension like a human with empathy.
7454,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,5.0,4.0,"Bracy is a great teacher and clearly knows her subject. Her lectures are well-designed with clear language and she drops hilarious lines from time to time. This class covered a lot of highly technical details and sub-regions of CS, and not attending the lectures would make it hard to understand the slides. That said, the textbook is comprehensive."
7455,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS341,1.0,4.0,"Really I wish I could give her 0 star. Just dropped the course, and do not understand where those good comments come from."
7456,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS341,1.0,3.0,"Not intelligent in teaching at all. Confusing lectures, baffled homework... I hope someone could let her know how awful her lectures are. By the way, she is rather mean and arrogant in the same time."
7457,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,2.0,"I love Bracy! She's a great professor and her lectures are done in a way that is easy to understand and accessible. Assignments are always geared towards what we have already learned; if you can do the assignments, the tests should not be too difficult. There are clicker questions to log attendance, but they're only 5% of your grade."
7458,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4410,1.0,2.0,One of the worst classes I have taken.
7459,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4410,1.0,5.0,Unintelligible class.
7460,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,5.0,4.0,"Bracy is a god among men. Never have I seen such a professor so passionate about both the material and her students. She gets so excited teaching and talking with students that it makes lectures my favorite time of the week. Yes, the class is difficult and condensed, but if you pay attention in lecture, the class is very manageable. SHE IS AMAZING!"
7461,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,5.0,5.0,"Professor Bracy is a talented and funny lecturer. Her lectures explain material extremely well while also being fairly concise. CS 3410's projects were hard (10-20 hours per project) and its exams harder, with means around a 55/90. I would highly recommend taking her classes she teaches."
7462,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,5.0,4.0,"Bracy is an amazing lecturer and made this class (which could have been terrible) pretty enjoyable and interesting. I really loved her classes and thought the assignments were pretty standard for a CS core class. Also, she's awesome to talk to outside of class and genuinely cares about her students. 10/10 would recommend!"
7463,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,2.0,"Bracy is so great that I'm taking CS 2110 with her next semester. I loved her teaching style because I am a very visual learner (she's won teaching awards). She inspires great questions from her students in lecture, and the lecture material clearly laid out what was expected on exams. Beware of the tricky assignments and make use of office hours."
7464,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,4.0,3.0,"Her lectures were usually pretty good, but sometimes slightly disorganized. She's super nice though and has plenty of office hours! Apparently her assignments were a lot harder than the fall CS 1110 professor's, but they were doable."
7465,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,4.0,Bracy is by far the best professor I've had at Cornell! She is passionate about CS and her lectures are clear and enormously helpful. The assignments were quite difficult at times but prepared you greatly for the prelims and final. I came in with zero coding experience and learned so much in a semester. Challenging but immensely rewarding class!
7466,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS1110,5.0,2.0,"She is a great professor. Her lecture style was clear, and I the examples made tough concepts easy to learn. Her expectations were clear and it was easy to gage how I was doing in the class. Not an overbearing amount of work, and makes CS really fun to learn. Also, she is just an awesome human."
7467,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,5.0,4.0,"I really loved cs3410 with her :) I maybe only scraped past tests, but it was worth it for the interesting lecture and great content."
7468,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4410,5.0,4.0,"Best undergrad professor I've had. She turned systems from a hated subject of mine into my graduate focus. Negative comments below are reactions to unconventional teaching. Lectures focus on concepts, exams are difficult but test your grasp of concepts in terms of big picture. Not a cookie-cutter professor/lecturer - what makes her great."
7469,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,5.0,4.0,Great Professor. The lectures are very clear. Attend the classes since It takes more time to figure out the lecture note than just attending the class. Not sure why are there so many very negatives comments. I took 4410 in the Fall semester. The lectures are a bit slow and repetitive and the projects are pretty difficult. But t's fine overall.
7470,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,5.0,5.0,"Super difficult class, but the best proffessor I've had at cornell"
7471,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4410,1.0,5.0,Awesome teaching with low scores. Think thoroughly before you enroll!!
7472,2109847,Anne,Bracy,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS3410,4.0,5.0,"Fun lectures that fly over topics at the speed of light. Be sure to read up before lecture begins (there's HW before every lecture to help with that) and take notes like a good student. Tests are difficult and annoying as they often test a concept that you know well but contorted so that no one knows how to answer. Still, great, fun person."
7474,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS5780,2.0,1.0,Easy class filled with lots of regurgitation and little problem solving
7475,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,3.0,Most enthusiastic professors I have ever seen in my life. Answers every question with patience and is very funny
7476,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic lecturer who's really passionate about the material. Despite the high number of students, he interacts with students as much as he can. He comes from the industry and since becoming a professor has built around the world a great academic reputation. Couldn't have asked for a better professor. Lots of projects and hard exams, be prepared."
7477,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,3.0,Extraordinary lectures!
7478,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,3.0,Best lectures i have ever heard in machine learning. The way he sets the intuition is simply out of this world. Thank you so much Dr. Weinberger to break these complex algorithms down and make them super easy to understand
7479,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,1.0,This class was so tedious
7480,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,3.0,"Context: I've taken most of the Machine Learning classes Cornell has to offer, and this is the very best class Cornell has to offer on the subject. If you *ever* want to do machine learning for a tech company, or even your side project/hustle, then this is the class you should take. No idea why there are so many bad ratings for such a good class."
7481,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,1.0,Take 4786 to get some real design experience instead of this waste of time.
7482,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,1.0,I recommend a more rigorous ML class.
7483,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,1.0,Kilian brushes over all the material we need to know for tests and for projects and spends excessive amounts of time on proofs that ultimately teach us nothing.
7484,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,3.0,BAD CLASS! BAD PROF!
7485,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,2.0,Praise the department for putting a different prof in charge of 4780 next year. This was an unbearable class.
7486,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,1.0,"Tests check how many equations you can memorize rather than a fundamental understanding of machine learning. Disorganized lectures. Tedious, buggy assignments. Useless HW assignments."
7487,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,4.0,"Great lecturer, fair tests, and makes the subject seem interesting."
7488,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,1.0,Really bad class
7489,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,2.0,4.0,"Professor Weinberger was an entertainer first and a lecturer second. In the end, I forgot all the material the second the final exam ended."
7490,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Weinberger is an expert on the material and covers a broad field with sufficient depth. There are growing pains to having such a large class size due to the growing popularity of the topic but I learned a lot regardless. Well prepared lecture notes and entertaining, effective demos."
7491,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS5780,2.0,2.0,"The worst part of the class is feeling intimidated by how hard Kilian says the course is when, in fact, it isn't."
7492,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,1.0,3.0,ML with Prof. Kilian was the worst 4000 level CS class I have taken.
7493,2254913,Kilian,Weinberger,Cornell University,Computer Science,CS4780,5.0,3.0,The best class I have taken at Cornell! An excellent class to develop a strong intuition of ML. Prof Weinberger is an outstanding lecturer; the best I have had in three years at Cornell. He really cares about students understanding the content and he asks students' feedback. More time on DL can make the class even better. Or a separate DL class!
7494,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIONB2100,5.0,2.0,Very witty and entertaining lecturer.  Doesn't hurt that his material was some of the most interesting of the class.
7495,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO102,1.5,5.0,He talked a lot about his loons and his research and he made sure to put those on his exams... He's writes everything on a projector and its really hard to read and boring to wait for him to finish writing
7496,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO102,3.5,4.0,"He just retired, but he was such a great lecturer.  I loved to listen to him speak"
7497,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO102,4.0,4.0,"Lectures are interesting,  made entertaining by occasional anecdotes and practical applications. Often can't answer questions/makes blunders, but generally figures it out.  Class is hard, but if you stay on top of the readings and study hard you'll do just fine."
7498,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIONB221,4.0,5.0,"Challenging course, but Walcott is a good guy."
7501,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIONB221,4.5,4.0,"Also had him for BIOG 101-102.  He's retired?  He's the official teacher for 221, so I'm not sure how accurate that is.  Fairly good lecturer, at times a little dry but well... intro bio is always dry. My behavior class he has a lot of people guest lecturing for so I haven't seen him do a whole lot this semester so far."
7502,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIOG101102,4.5,5.0,"After the first prelim, I was nearly failing the class. But Professor Walcott really helped me through this difficult class. That along with my efforts, I passed the class. Professor Walcott is also always looking to help students. He really wants people to do well."
7503,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIONB221,4.0,3.0,"well spoken, funny lecturer."
7504,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO101,5.0,2.0,A sweet old man who is very fair
7505,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIOG101,4.0,3.0,"Walcott is the cutest old man! It was great to start off bio w/such a great professor.  Not an easy class, but he made it worthwile.  Too bad he's retired, but take BioNB 221 if you want to see him guest-lecture."
7506,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIOG1012,5.0,2.0,"Professor Walcott was great: he was funny without being unprofessional and informative without being boring.  He is a true gentleman.  Also, he was very approachable and helpful regarding even the smallest matters.  Hooray for Walcott"
7507,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO101,5.0,4.0,"Dr Walcott is the coolest!!! He talks about naked RNA and how to make **** apple cider! ooo, naked, what's that about?"
7508,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO101,4.5,2.0,Cute old man!  He's so cute!  And old!  So cute and old!  His lectures are awesome too.  But he's so cute and old!
7509,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO101102,4.0,5.0,"he's your average friendly local bio professor who teaches you to ""say 'know' to drugs""  He's a funny guy, but the class is ridiculously difficult."
7510,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIOG101,5.0,5.0,"Great Professor, great class. But the course is very difficult, designed to weed out pre-meds. Too bad 2004 Spring was his last semester teaching it, it will be hard to follow in his footsteps."
7511,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO101,5.0,2.0,great professor
7512,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIOG101,4.5,4.0,"This prof is great, he's hilarious and an engaging lecturer.  Too bad bio's in the morning when people can't stay awake.  The class is tough, but he puts most of the info out there very clearly and then expects you to make the connections."
7513,99055,Charles,Walcott,Cornell University,Science,BIO101,3.5,3.0,better than meisner
7514,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3330,4.5,4.0,"He's a great guy. He was extremely helpful in office hours and his tests/quizzes were very fair. He made it very clear what material would be on the exam. However, his exams are difficult, but if you put in the work, you will succeed. "
7515,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,3530,1.0,4.0,"Lectures often unclear, sometimes conflicted with material from the text"
7516,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3590,5.0,4.0,He's a great professor. I Learned a lot from him. He's also got great stories from his time in research labs and industry.
7517,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,2.0,very kind and caring
7518,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,2.0,i loved sogah he is kind and really cares about his students
7519,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,4.5,3.0,"Sogah was excellent. He was extremely CLEAR in his lectures for what he expected of you, and he went above and beyond to ensure that you understood the material by offering extensive office hours, as well as optional Friday Review sessions, which over-prepared you for exams. If you went to class, read the text and did problem sets, you'll be fine."
7520,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,1.0,2.0,"one of my worst professors ever. Lectures are absolutely useless and he rambles on and on. Prelims are fair though and come straight from psets, fridays sessions and notes"
7521,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,2.0,5.0,"His explanations for reaction mechanisms only make sense if you know what's going on to begin with, so that defeats the purpose of coming to class to learn."
7522,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,1.5,4.0,"Awful professor. Does not really care about students or grades. Lectures are pretty useless, very disorganized and prelims can have questions that will throw you for a loop. Do reading and the problem sets and you'll be fine, but forget about actually learning anything from the professor."
7523,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,3.5,2.0,"Sogah seems like he really cares about his students with his many OH and friday sessions. That being said, I thought that he was a terrible lecturer. He is bad at explaining concepts clearly and moves very fast. I stopped going after 1 week and just looked at the book. Everything he says is straight from the book. Tests are fair and straightforward"
7524,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,5.0,3.0,"Extremely helpful and wants his students to do well (Fri review sessions and lots of OH). Get weekly help, do the PS when they are assigned, stay on top of readings and you will be fine.  People who complain about orgo just don't do the work necessary to do well.  Prelim averages are so low b/c people don't study, not because tests are too hard."
7525,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,4.0,3.0,Sogah is the real deal- if you cannot learn chemistry from this man you are simply a joke and i hope you get rejected from medical school
7526,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,3.5,4.0,"I got a B in 357 and decided that I wanted to do better in 358--so I actually started reading, working, trying--I went to his office hours to clarify things, and sometimes went to the Friday sessions (not vital for the class)and got an A.  Do all the problem sets. Go to lecture to see what he emphasizes. Don't be intimidated by him. Fair prelims."
7527,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,4.5,4.0,"You can do dis.  You can do dat.  This reaction will go extremely very well.  On paper it is okay, but in lab it will explode.  You do dis and your home free."
7528,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,1.0,5.0,"lectures straight from book, terrible, boring, doesn't explain clearly, bad accent,makes many mistakes, can't teach/explain for life"
7529,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,ORGO358,4.5,4.0,"He teaches straight from the book.  So the person who thought Sogah taught extra stuff, READ!.  To the person who thinks Sogah's heart is not in it, believe me.. it is: Friday Sessions, office hours, calling chemistry ""beautiful"". You get what you give. PERIOD!  Don't expect an A or a medical career without staying up on Fri nights doing orgo."
7530,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM3580,1.0,5.0,terrible at teaching; accent difficult to understand; does not explain well
7531,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,3.5,3.0,"Like first semester Orgo nuances and different reactions are covered in lecture that are not covered in the book. Sogah was clearer than Ruttledge and his lectures were much less ambiguous, though there was a tendency to mumble. Not as entertaining as Ruttleged, but much more passionate, and that's what can make a student want to study."
7532,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,4.0,4.0,"Overall good professor-not as entertaining as Ruttledge, but not as difficult. Passionate about chem, and offers Fri. problemm solving session-VERY helpful for prelims. Sticks mostly to the book. Polymer stuff isn't actually that bad. Work hard and you'll succeed in 358."
7533,511286,Dotsevi,Sogah,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM358,3.5,2.0,"MUCH EASIER than last semester. Tests are succinct and straight-forward. Sure, he isn't Tom Ruttledge. No one can understand him - he mumbles and babbles, but that just means you have to go out of your way to ""get"" the concepts. Probably THE weed-out class of pre-meds. So, how badly do you want med school? Think about it and get ready to WORK."
7535,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,5.0,5.0,"Very knowledgeable and organized but, but an easy A she is not. Genuinely interested in her students and how to best support them. One of my favorite professors Ive taken this far."
7536,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,5.0,4.0,"Honestly thought I would have received a worse grade, but extra credit helped exponentially! Amazing ideas and concepts that are applicable, stayed awake every lecture. Test questions are tricky, so really know everything front to back. Worked the hardest for this class out of all of my classes. Use the learning objective questions!"
7537,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,3.0,4.0,Prof. Z is a great lecturer and a really cool person. She often cites her own studies which I love. You need to go to the lectures even though the slides are posted- otherwise you won't understand them. And you need to read the textbook and outside readings. It's work.
7538,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,4.0,1.0,"Honestly, pretty easy class. I took it as a freshman and had no problem with the class. The study guide IS EXACTLY the same as the prelim.. if you know the study guide, you WILL do well. The lectures helped but I skipped a bunch and still did fine because everything was posted online.. Readings weren't mandatory; you just have to know the main idea"
7539,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,2.0,4.0,"Class is much,much harder and more intensive than it should be. I have no clue why it isn't a 4 credit course for the amount of work it involves. Overall, not worth it if you just need an easy psych course. There are plenty of better, more interesting, less time consuming psych courses offered.."
7540,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,3.0,5.0,"Very intelligent lecturer, but her class was incredibly challenging. You will need to study very diligently just to pull off anything above a B from personal experience. The amount of readings for the class are through the roof. I learned a lot from the class, but seriously, only take this class if you have strong interest in the topic."
7541,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,4.0,5.0,Reading according to schedule is the key. She is a good lecturer but not at all an easy professor. Lecture will just help you understand but actual contents for the prelims will be from textbook and readings. Take advantages of all extra credit opportunities. Only take it if you're interested in this area. Challenging prelims but doable if you try.
7542,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,3.0,5.0,"There is a ton of reading, the exams are very hard. I find this class harder than organic chemistry, which is the worst class I've ever taken. The means are low, and there is no curve. Professor Zayas is a very good lecturer, though. Most of the information from lectures is not on the slides, so it is important to go to lecture."
7543,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,4.0,3.0,"Would recommend if you place out of intro. Personality is a complex topic, but Prof. Zayas is great and boils it down to six different paradigms' views. She is nice, mellow, and easy to like. Her tests are not unreasonable for an Ivy league school you just need to read every assigned passage and take diligent notes."
7544,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSY2650,4.5,4.0,one of my favorite classes at cornell! the exams are reasonable but you have to study and there are lots of readings.
7545,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,HD2600,5.0,3.0,I really like this class. Professor Zayes is good lecturer and keeps it interesting. The materials is just interesting. I also think it is possible to do well if you get past the first prelim
7546,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,5.0,3.0,"I love this class! Material is super interesting, but there is a lot of it. Prof. Zayas is great. Engaging. The prelim is reasonable if you focus on the study guide."
7547,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,HD2600,4.0,4.0,"Even if you think you know all the material, something is bound to pop up on every exam that you've never heard of. She's very clear during her lectures and makes the topic seem stupidly easy, so much so you won't want to read the assigned readings, but she WILL get you during the exams. Suggestion: READ ALL THE READINGS ACCORDING TO HER SCHEDULE!"
7548,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,4.5,4.0,Material is super interesting and the prof does a good job keeping it new. The exams are fine if you study.
7549,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,5.0,4.0,"FUn course. Love it! The tests are challenging, so you have to study! But there is a curve and extra credit options."
7550,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCHNA,4.0,4.0,"thumbs up. there is too much reading for the three credits, but it is possible to do really well, and the material is interesting."
7551,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,5.0,3.0,Great professor; very intelligent
7552,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH4910,4.5,5.0,Best methods class on campus. Way more than 4 hours of credit worth of work. student led lectures are hit or miss. Prof. Z. should lecture more.
7553,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,5.0,4.0,"One of my favorite classes. Prof. Zayas is a dynamic lecturer, but can go off topic. There are two writing assignments and 3 exams. Topic is interesting, and it's easy to get an A."
7554,963906,Vivian,Zayas,Cornell University,Psychology,PSYCH2750,4.5,4.0,"best class i've taken at cornell so far! brings in tv clips from friends to explain concepts. exams are hard, but there is a curve."
7556,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,5.0,3.0,"He is extremely knowledgable about microeconomics and is genuinely interested in helping students, especially during office hours (which he conducted even over weekends during exam season!) Sections with the TA are really helpful but skipping lectures is not an option. His exams are slightly long but the curve in this course is generous."
7557,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,4.0,4.0,"absolutely loved this course! challenging content but very doable, and bersharov is very thorough and concise with his lectures. Prelims are exactly like the problem sets, very fair and no surprises, the curve is also pretty generous. would definitely recommend."
7558,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,4.0,4.0,"Genuinely wants every student to understand the core concepts of Microeconomic-Theory. The content is difficult, but he gives a lot of practice. In terms of workload, he may give some of the most difficult/grueling assignments in the Econ Department, but it really does help you understand the content."
7559,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,5.0,5.0,"Go to lecture &amp; discussion b/c he doesn't post slides or care about the textbook. HW 3-4 hrs/wk. Tests are hard. Study a lot, &amp; then still expect to get saved by the curve.   Definitely the hardest professor for 3030 but you'll learn a lot more. Not even just learning it more in depth, but like straight up covering topics other profs. don't get to"
7560,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,4.0,4.0,good professor. challenging  but if you put in the effort its not too bad. very thorough
7561,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,4.0,4.0,"Besharov's class is very math based, which can make it tricky. He is very willing to help you if you come into his office hours, and the curve is very helpful. Maybe not the easiest intermediate macro professor, but I had a very clear understanding of the subject by the time I left the class. Very helpful guy."
7562,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,3.5,4.0,"Looks a lot like Sacha Baron Cohen, that aside he knows his stuff and you'll leave the class with a great understanding of intermediate micro. If you aren't comfortable with basic calc and lots of algebra you might want to take the class with someone else. "
7563,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,2.0,4.0,Never take his class. Not recommended.
7564,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,EC3030,4.0,3.0,Tough but extremely fair professor. Curve was generous if it needed to be.
7565,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON4210,5.0,3.0,"If you want the easiest classes possible, Besharov is not for you. He is, however, a very clear lecturer who really knows his stuff about a surprisingly wide variety of topics, everything from intermediate micro to Money and Credit, which are pretty much opposites. Tests are hard (time constraints) but reasonable, and he usually curves to B+A-."
7566,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3030,4.0,2.0,"I think all the people complaining that Besharov is ""too difficult"" or goes ""too theoretical"" are using Masson as the ideal benchmark. But honestly after taking higher level econ courses that required intermediate micro, I feel like I was more prepared for the material based on the rigor of this class. If you genuinely want to learn econ, take his."
7567,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3310,5.0,3.0,"Besharov is a good teacher. I had him for Money and Credit and Intermediate Micro and liked both classes. He covers a lot of material, generally follows the book fairly closely if you prefer to learn it that way. His explanations are very clear and he's extremely willing to help struggling students. His one weakness is that his tests can be long"
7568,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3130,4.0,4.0,"His exams are fair assuming you've kept up with lectures and problem sets. Definitely knows his material, worth taking this class."
7569,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3610,5.0,1.0,"I don't understand why he gets so many bad reviews here. As long as you prepare well for lectures and stay on top of the readings, the material is very manageable. The exams were long and stressful but not hard. All the material on the exam was covered in class and in the problem sets. The grading was harsh but the curve was more than generous."
7570,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3610,4.5,3.0,"I took 3 of his classes (Public Finance, Financial Economics, International Trade)all of which had the following commonalities: closely follow textbook, often supplement with current articles (article discussions were common), solving actual numeric problems, problem sets every week, understand problem sets and you do great on"
7571,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON313,4.5,4.0,"Great Professor. Extremely intelligent. Knows exactly what he is talking about. He talks a little bit too fast tho and can be hard to follow at times. He explains the method and underlying philosophy of economics and stimulates you to think. Overall a brilliant professor. His class is hard, but take him if you are truly interested in economics."
7572,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3130,2.0,4.0,terrible class in general. Besharov hardly makes the material worth learning and doesn't care at all about his students.
7573,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3330,3.5,2.0,"Class was sometimes way more abstract than the problem sets and ultimately, the exams. Obviously, the people who stopped showing up meant that if you actually went to class and paid attention, the curve boosted your grade."
7574,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON333,5.0,4.0,"I took financial economics with him. Not an easy A even if you study.  However, he is very smart, approachable, and interesting to talk to.  From what I heard, this is far better than the other Finance courses at Cornell in terms of gaining an appreciation of the material. If you want an easy A, I suggest the AEM or Hotel versions."
7575,1214084,Gregory,Besharov,Cornell University,Economics,ECON3130,1.5,5.0,Lectures are too fast to comprehend/take notes. Weekly graded problem sets too difficult to complete even after reading chapter/attending lecture. He posts prob set answers sometimes over a week later but they don't help unless you do the problem again.  Class is too difficult/fast paced/taught poorly to succeed in.
7577,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,1.0,3.0,Unfair in his dealings with students. Only cares about himself and how he looks to his peers and the administration. Deceptive and dirty. Plays politics a lot.
7578,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.0,4.0,"A very helpful professor who is always open to questions from students. He responds to emails quickly. Lectures are also well-organized, (almost) each time ending with an interesting demo. Exams are not that difficult once you practice past prelims and problem sets. Be prepared for the time-consuming lab reports :)"
7579,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2080,4.0,2.0,"Really nice prof. You don't really need to go to class because he posts lecture notes (I didn't go 95% of the time). Just skim the notes, do some problems, and you'll do fine"
7580,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2080,4.0,4.0,"I had Professor Davis for CHEM 2080. While his lectures may seem a bit dull at first, they become interesting, and they are invaluable to passing this course. He always tries to keep things interesting, and always shows cool demos. His prelims are extremely fair. If you studied well, you will have no problem. Overall, Professor Davis is a good prof"
7581,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2080,4.0,4.0,"The lectures are pretty heavy. Better go prepared e.g print the lecture slides maybe. Prof D used 90% of the lecture time going through some tough practice problems which turn out to be pretty helpful when studying for prelims. Labs started out tough and get a little better toward the end, so really work on those lab reports!"
7582,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM208,4.0,4.0,"Delivers introductory chemistry material slowly but in an effective way. Attending lectures helps hugely, as he goes over practice problems that are similar to required weekly homework. (Also looks like the grandpa in Up!)"
7583,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2080,3.0,4.0,"He was fine but nothing special. Tests are tricky, because he only really covers the bare minimum in class"
7584,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2080,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Davis did an OK job.  His explanations were very clear and simple.  Often he ran out of time at the end of lecture and scrambled to finish demos.  The first exam was way too easy and was compensated for by a much more difficult second exam.  Overall, he was fair and did an OK job.  I stopped going to class eventually and still did well."
7585,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,2.0,5.0,"Came into this class as a chem major, left as NOT a chem major. His lectures are mostly useless, and it's much easier to understand if you just read the textbook. TA's office hours are hit or miss. Prof's office hours were not really helpful. FYI, do NOT take this class if you aren't confident in your previous chemistry knowledge!"
7586,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.5,3.0,He's a great teacher with a lot of passion for what he does. The demos are all really cool. My favorite class in freshman year
7587,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.5,4.0,"As most people have said, the lectures are standard and the demos are cool. The P-sets really are a reflection of what he'll put on the tests, so do those (even though they aren't for a grade). He himself is pretty reasonable when it comes to grades and advice, though he may go over your head if you ask him about other chem topics."
7588,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.5,2.0,"Good teacher. Knows his stuff and communicates it pretty well. Tests are fair. Labs are difficult but there is a curve so it's all good. Funny guy, too, and demos are awesome."
7589,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,5.0,4.0,"Demos ever lecture, which kept it interesting-- he's really great at making the material clear if you listen, though I can't say he's particularly exciting or funny (you may fall asleep in class). Exams are doable, and the class has a pretty big curve. Lab starts out next to impossible but gets a lot better."
7590,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.0,4.0,"Very friendly teacher. He definitely loves the demos (as everyone else here has commented). His problem sets are a very good representation of the prelims, so if you understand the psets, you're set. Although I definitely didn't do well in the course, I'd definitely recommend people to take it (especially if you've had AP chem.) You'll enjoy it!"
7591,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.0,2.0,"Great lecturer! Problem sets are a very good indication of exam-type problems. Exams can be a tad bit long, but nothing unmanageable. Helpful during office hours and very enthusiastic and knowledgeable regarding the material. Awesome demos as well."
7592,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.5,3.0,His lectures were very interesting. He always has some demos for each of the lecture sessions. He communicates the materials very well to the students. He is also very organized and the exams are reasonable.
7593,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,4.5,4.0,"Great demos. He is really really into kinetics so if you don't understand rate laws well you are pretty much screwed. Tries to keep the class interesting, it sort of ran out of steam at the end of the semester, but it is very obvious that his genuinely interested in his students learning and chemistry overall."
7594,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM2150,5.0,3.0,"I want to know where his cartoons went! Professor Davis loves chemistry and it shows, whether he's randomly firing cannons into the lecture hall or working out the steady state approximation for the tenth time. He explains concepts thoroughly and gives fair exams, not easy, not backbreaking. He's a really nice guy too!"
7595,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM208,4.0,1.0,"Cool Demos, wakes me up when I am sleeping in class. It's very easy. I got A+."
7596,508817,Floyd,Davis,Cornell University,Chemistry,CHEM208,4.5,3.0,Lectures are great; partly due to his clarity and partly to his demos. Understanding and helpful. The class was tough but problem sets and labs helped prepare you for exam.
10913,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WCWP10A,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gocsik is perhaps the best professor I've had in life. She facilitates class discussion in a way that your opinions will be heard and weighted. Karen also goes over different aspects of the world in and out of class, and she's the person to turn to if you want to talk just about anything. My writing improved A LOT in her class."
10914,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WCWP10A,4.5,4.0,"She teaches at UCSD now and is by far the best writing teacher I've had in a while. The class itself isn't of the best structure (everything is geared towards 3 essays, where the last essay practically dictates your grade). She actually teaches you how to write better, but the class is time consuming."
10915,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WCWP10A,3.0,4.0,"Now a UCSD prof for Warren college. Very unlikeable GE class. Only 3 grades, which are the 3 final papers. Time consuming but the grading is very fair--so much so that it basically rewards already good writers and the rest will get a B+ or below. I did not learn to write better, but at least the topic (technology) was interesting to read about."
10916,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT2,4.5,5.0,"Prof. Gocsik through me into the deep end during freshman fall since her class has been the indisputably tough. Despite the intense discussions, complex texts and multiple drafts of papers, I now look back at the class with a sense of accomplishment and relief. I am no longer afraid to write and am confident in my writing ability."
10917,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT003,5.0,5.0,Demanding but great professor. The classes are great!!
10918,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT2,5.0,5.0,"Karen has taken the ""none"" out of my nonsensical writing, and made it ""sense"". She is the best professor I have ever had. K is genuinely dedicated to the success of her students- both in and out of the classroom. You can talk to her about just anything. And her inner glow is what keeps students motivated despite the mammoth course load."
10919,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT23,5.0,3.0,"Karen is the highlight of my academic experience at Dartmouth. She taught me how to write papers from scratch, until I got an A. She is a very hardworking and interesting teacher, who makes a class so interesting, that the student is injected with the desire/impatience to share his opinions when going to class. It was a pleasure to be  her student."
10920,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT2,5.0,5.0,The best class I've taken at Dartmouth and the reason I know how towrite A papers now
10921,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,ENGL009,4.5,3.0,"Karen cares about her students, and she cares about them deeply. She injects energy into every classroom she walks into as well. Her knowledge of our culture is phenomenal, and she likes to argue her points until she has beat the living daylight out of all the angles. I suggest Karen wholeheartedly."
10922,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT2,5.0,3.0,"Karen's Writing 2-3 classes are known as some of the most hardcore classes at Dartmouth... but you learn so much that it's well worth it. I wish I could find other classes at D that made me think as much as Karen's class did. She gives a lot of work, but puts as much care into the class as we do, often staying up until 4am or later marking papers."
10923,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT2,4.5,4.0,Karen achieves a perfect balance between laying out an argument that an author has made and making her students think creatively and deeply about it. HEr class was one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I have had and my writing skills improved to a surprisingly high degree.
10925,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WHIT002,4.5,1.0,"Great prof, great person!"
10926,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,ENG0203,5.0,5.0,"If I could, I'd take Karen's class again. She is one of the most caring, intelligent and dedicated professors ever. Her class is always full of energy and thought provoking. She will guides you through to become a better writer, independent and logical thinker, and eloquent communicator. You'll be another one very lucky person if you learn from her"
10927,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT3,5.0,4.0,"Karen is not simply a teacher, she is a true mentor, capable of truly connecting with various students. On a continent where unfortunately I have not men too many intellectuals, Karen is one of the few who taught me how to be a confident thinker, who feels free to ALWAYS raise questions rather than focus on the answers. Love learning?=&gt; Karen!!!"
10929,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT2,4.0,4.0,"The professor has done a lot of preparation for class in order to equip the students with great writing and discussion skills.  The assignments, although quite hard and sometimes can be quite painful, have brought me out of my comfort zone which eventually ends up widening my comfort zone as well."
10930,1100359,Karen,Gocsik,Dartmouth College,Writing,WRIT2,5.0,5.0,"Karen is a great professor! She really cares about teaching, and she is a very accessible professor as well. Her teaching methods are extremely innovative and involve lots of class discussion. Karen is a hard but fair grader, and her grades are always accompanied by large amounts of feedback and comments. If you want to learn you will not go wrong."

Karen is first of all a great friend that you can talk to about anything on you mind. She would be always interested to hear what you have to say. She has the capacity to connect to people from very different backgrounds and understand them.For that reason,she is a global professor"

10934,261485,Prasad,Jayanti,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COSC30,5.0,3.0,"Best Professor I've had at Dartmouth, hands down. No matter who you take them with, CS30 is going to be tough, and CS31 is going to be tougher. However, if you do it with Jayanti, you'll enjoy yourself and you'll enjoy the class and you'll actually feel like you've learned something."

10943,261485,Prasad,Jayanti,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS25,5.0,3.0,He filled in for my professor a few times and i REALLY wish he tought the class full time.  He explained everything so clearly and was so entertainint

10952,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON26,4.5,4.0,"This guy is a genius. Most eye-opening class I've ever taken.  It takes 6 hours of preparation for each class, but completely worth it, because it's really interesting stuff."
10953,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON26,5.0,1.0,If you get an A in Econ 26 you are respected by all the alumni network.
10954,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON026,4.5,5.0,One of the toughest classes I've ever taken. Not conceptually difficult but it covers a lot of material. First class I've ever read the entire textbook for. The class (socratic method)structure forces you to learn the material well. Definetly the class I've learned the most in.
10955,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON026,3.0,5.0,Great professor who holds his students to a very high level. The class was very difficult but I really enjoyed it.

10957,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON26,2.0,4.0,Practice exams and memorize his book.
10958,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECONECON,4.0,5.0,"Some students will be well advised not to watch Super bowl when it's review time. Don't blame your professor for your poor performance and bad grades. The word is ""awful,"" not ""aweful."" And it is ""nightmare,"" not ""nitemare."" This professor is very knowledgeable. Hard work pays off though."

10960,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON26,1.0,4.0,"This guy sucks! He holds office hours as early as possible to minimize the number of visits. He does absolutely NO teaching in class. The class consists of randomly selecting students to answer the questions from the textbook. And then you're graded on it. This is NOT a business school format, where there is actual discussion. There's more..."
10961,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON26,2.5,5.0,"Kohn isn't a great instructor, but the class format is good because it forces you to learn it on your own.  Like law school format where he calls on you randomly to answer questions.  But after taking the class and being a study group leader for the class I think even I could do a better job of explaining the concepts."
10962,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON35,1.0,5.0,Aweful!!! The only reason I took this class was to get rid of the requirement and the professor made a bad class into a nitemare. Teaching = crap; attitude = crap. I hear dude was in the Israeli army; I wouldn't be surprised if he'd killed someone with his own hands.
10963,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON,1.0,1.0,To call this **** a jerk is an insult to all the honest jerks out there. He's lunatic. He delibrately misguided the class on a test and seemed to really get a big kick out of it.
10964,741913,Meir,Kohn,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON,1.5,5.0,yeah - he is a bit of a jerk.  Teaches his class like B-school.  My favorite Kohn story is that he scheduled a review during the super-bowl.

Reading the class materials is an essential, because you will definitely miss some of the information given in her lectures."
10967,282419,Deborah,Nichols,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH008,2.0,4.0,Classes are heavy on lecture and are not very engaging. One of the worse classes I have taken.

10970,282419,Deborah,Nichols,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH8,1.0,5.0,The prof. totaly blew it. By the end of the term more than 3/4 of students were sick and tired of both the topic and her attitude. Not recommended...
10971,282419,Deborah,Nichols,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH8,1.0,5.0,"The most boring and dull class ever. How can Nichols take an interesting topic like archeology and turn it into this crap is beyond my comprehension. On a personal note, I find her to be a jerk. She acts as if she's interested in having interaction with students, but she wants to kick you out 5 minutes after you step  into her office...not good..."

10973,282419,Deborah,Nichols,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH8,1.0,5.0,"This was perhaps the worst class I had in my four years at Dartmouth. I've never seen a more annoying professor than Deborah Nichols. She's boring, self-absorbed, and couldn't care less if the material made sense to students. I did get a good grade, but I hated the class, Nichols, and archaeology..."

He has very little attention span for anything to do with students. He just reads his powerpoint slides but if a student has a question he gets confused and can't answer.  His section of psych 1: super boring.  All the other profs teaching it were great though."
10980,312215,Yale,Cohen,Dartmouth College,Psychology,PSYCH,1.0,4.0,"The most boring class I ever had at Dartmouth by far. He just clicks through countless powerpoint presentations and drones on. Doesn't answer questions clearly. Rude to students who ask questions. Oh and is just me, or does the comment beginning with ""Dr. Cohen"" sound like it was written by him."
10981,312215,Yale,Cohen,Dartmouth College,Psychology,NEUROSCIENCE,1.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE! Run! Unless you actually enjoy 5 unmitigated hours of PowerPoint slides a week do NOT take a class with this guy. Far more interested in personal, esoteric research than actually teaching."
10982,312215,Yale,Cohen,Dartmouth College,Psychology,PSYCH06,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Cohen represents the best of Dartmouth.  His enthusiasm for neuroscience is infectious and he proved to have a nearly inexhaustible patience in helping me to understand some very difficult subject matter.  He's also a nice guy. The class is hard if you don’t keep up with the reading, but at least I actually learning something worth knowing."
10983,312215,Yale,Cohen,Dartmouth College,Psychology,PSYC6,1.0,4.0,Yale Cohen is a moron.  He killed my enthusiasm for Neuroscience and was a terrible teacher.

We were expected to post our questions online about each reading; he would select some of these posts to discuss in class the next day. During class, he just elaborated on our comments (very little lecture), so our learning felt scattered and too detail-oriented. But easy A."
10988,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENG24,5.0,5.0,great
10989,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL5,4.5,3.0,He's a good professor. Very intelligent and helpful. He requires that you meet with him about one or two of your papers and do a rewrite but I did not find him to be an overbearing grader. Some however found him more difficult so I may have just been more prepared. He get's a bad rap for opposing greek life.
10990,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLISH28,1.5,2.0,"Terrible class.  Rambling, whiny professor.  Inconsistent grader."
10991,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLISH27,5.0,3.0,"I agree with all that has been written above, and I'd add that he knows his material better than probably every other professor I've had, something that becomes much more important at the college level, I think. Good guy, great prof."
10992,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENG27,4.5,3.0,"Professor Luxon could have easily conducted class by lecturing on the pertinent scholarly arguments on texts. However, class was an open forum in which everyone's opinion was equal. Professor Luxon taught students how to relate to the texts with ease."
10993,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENG27,5.0,3.0,His lectures flew by and he always engaged the students. Great sense of humor. Always available for questions. He genuinely cared about presenting material in the most interesting and up-to-date way (good utilization of the internet and digital library).
10994,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENG27,5.0,4.0,A true teacher in every sense of the word.  Professor Luxon really cares about the academic progress of the individual students and shows interest in the students themselves.  One of the finest professors I have had at Dartmouth.
10995,423774,Thomas,Luxon,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL27,5.0,3.0,"Poetry and Prose of John Milton (English 28), Shakespeare I (English 24), Critical Theory (Comparative Literature 72), The Merchant of Venice (Jewish Studies 40), advanced seminars in Milton, and Poetry and Prose of the Seventeenth Century (English 27)."

Gives some practice problems that are 1/10th the difficulty of the actual exams. Will teach a subject, then expect you to expand your learning-- on the exam."
10997,1742121,Lorenzo,Torresani,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS174,1.0,1.0,"A very mean prof, and you need to be careful about everything."

11001,1742121,Lorenzo,Torresani,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS174,2.5,2.0,The lecture is overall OK. Pronunciation is clear. He is a strict and rigid. He don't  even allow a different form of answer in the homework.
11002,1742121,Lorenzo,Torresani,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS174,4.5,1.0,The lectures are easy to follow. Not much using textbook. 3 Homework requires both programming (MATLAB) and theory questions. The project is fun and I learning a lot via doing it which is my own proposed problem using machine learning models.
11003,1742121,Lorenzo,Torresani,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COSCML,1.0,4.0,Avoid if possible. The lecture is not well prepared and you will find he always use the word 'exactly' to answer your questions.

11007,264228,Don,Pease,Dartmouth College,Humanities,ENGL42,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor!
11008,264228,Don,Pease,Dartmouth College,Humanities,ENGLISH4563,3.5,2.0,One of my favorite professors ever.  Can be hard to follow sometimes but that's only because he knows so much and cares so much about the works he is discussing he has a hard time getting out evrything he wants to say.
11009,264228,Don,Pease,Dartmouth College,Humanities,MALS,1.0,4.0,Is far more interested in showing off his knowledge than helping students understand the subject. A reputation as an intellectual bully that is not completely undeserved.
11011,264228,Don,Pease,Dartmouth College,Humanities,AMPOETRY,3.0,4.0,"Brilliant at times, but needs to outline his lectures. Sometimes didn't even refer to the poetry we had read. There's no doubt, however, about his enthusiasm and his intellectual power (both enormous)."
11014,925252,Aden,Evens,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL17,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors at Dartmouth, and I say that from the other side being a professor myself now. Professor Evens (who is totally down to Earth and goes by Aden) is completely accessible, understanding, and fully invested in student learning. He cares deeply about teaching, and his knowledge is deep and interdisciplinary. New Media Fall '06"
11015,925252,Aden,Evens,Dartmouth College,English,ENG65,5.0,5.0,"Definitely one of the most inspirational professors I've ever had. Accessible outside the classroom and, as mentioned earlier, an intellectual powerhouse."

11017,925252,Aden,Evens,Dartmouth College,English,SFLIT,5.0,3.0,A man among men. 20 years getting edumacated and he did it like no other. I'd take a bullet for him.
11018,925252,Aden,Evens,Dartmouth College,English,ENG017,5.0,4.0,"Aden is the best Professor I have ever had. Intellectual powerhouse. He guides his students, showing them how to pull core ideas out texts that are too deep and difficult for most profs to venture. Zero ego, he seems to actually live for his work. This guy should get his own department."
11019,925252,Aden,Evens,Dartmouth College,English,ENG65,4.5,4.0,Aden EvEns is an awesome guy and now my advisor. I'm an English major at Dartmouth and his advise on writing and the way he grasps what I'm trying to say in a long and mangled argument is much better than any other professor here. He is incredibly smart and will work with you out side of class a lot.
11020,925252,Aden,Evens,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL63,5.0,4.0,"SO awesome, whether for writing skills/the material/just life advice. Makes sure to keep class interesting, awesome discussions. Cares about his students a LOT! Definitely take at least one class with him!"

11023,202458,Terry,Osborne,Dartmouth College,English,ENG5,5.0,2.0,"If you are one of the lucky few who landed in Prof O's freshman comp or freshman seminar, lucky, lucky you. He will push you to think more deeply about things you previously have not examined. I love him. When I look back at my Dartmouth experience (I'm a 98) he stands out as much as a walk across the green, coffee from rosey's cafe."
11024,202458,Terry,Osborne,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLISH7,5.0,3.0,Fantastic.
11026,202458,Terry,Osborne,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLENVS,5.0,2.0,Prof O is as commited to his students as any prof I have ever known.  He is passionate about what he does (writing) and is passionate about helping students become better writers and to know themselves better.  Highly recommended.  Essential to my Dartmouth experience.
11027,202458,Terry,Osborne,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLISH5,5.0,3.0,"One of the ONLY reasons why I stayed at Dartmouth.  He is a true reflection of what a professor should be.  Challenging, out-of-the box strategies (he took us to his home during the winter so we could experience some of Robert Frost's metaphors)!"
11028,202458,Terry,Osborne,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL5,5.0,3.0,Prof. O was great.  I really enjoyed class with him and would actually consider going to him for help with other classes in the future.
11030,501153,Douglass,Moody,Dartmouth College,English,WRT2,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor, get to know him and you can get really good recommendations and chances to take classes/go on the outside study abroad trip that isnt listed. His wife also organizes the Frank Gaurini institute for study abroad, so that a plus. As for the class, it was pretty easy but I liked the varied material he had. Great support."
11031,501153,Douglass,Moody,Dartmouth College,English,LACS20,3.0,1.0,"Extremely nice professor and person who truly cares for his students. He would do anything to help them. That said, he is perhaps a bit too easy and accommodating. There is minimal work for this course, to the point where I didn't learn much (or felt invested in the topic after a few weeks) and wished I'd been tested or lectured at more."
11032,501153,Douglass,Moody,Dartmouth College,English,WRT2,5.0,1.0,"extremely easy. the problem is that i didn't learn anything. he never corrected my essays, much less grade them."
11033,501153,Douglass,Moody,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL,5.0,1.0,he will write a nice recommendation.
11035,501153,Douglass,Moody,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLISH05,5.0,2.0,Extremely nice man who is willing to help and willing to listen and understand.
11038,2021893,Michael,Lurie,Dartmouth College,Classics,CLST24,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lurie is great. He is a tough grader, especially regarding presentations and papers, but he wants his students to succeed and is honest with positive feedback, too. My biggest complaint is that he does play pretty clear favorites, but our class was small and actually laughed and bonded over it. Also, he bought us pizza one time. Amazing."
11039,2021893,Michael,Lurie,Dartmouth College,Classics,CLST2,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lurie is without a doubt the best professor I've had at Dartmouth. His classes have helped me develop immensely as a thinker and have truly changed the way that I see the world. He challenges students, but the challenge is well worth it, and he works harder than any professor I know to ensure that every class is worthwhile and meaningful."
11040,2021893,Michael,Lurie,Dartmouth College,Classics,CLST2,5.0,4.0,"Michael Lurie is definitely the best professor I ever had. The passion with which he approaches every text, lecture, and conversation is electrifying. Through his high expectations for all his students he communicates his deep love and belief in both his work and those he works with. Put in the time to get to know him, he'll change your life."
11041,2021893,Michael,Lurie,Dartmouth College,Classics,CLST2,5.0,4.0,"CLST2 was an outstanding course that completely reshaped my understanding of Greek Tragedy. Professor Lurie is a dynamic, entertaining speaker who genuinely loves this subject, and his lectures are among the most informative I've encountered in Classics. Stands out as one of the best courses I've ever taken."
11042,2021893,Michael,Lurie,Dartmouth College,Classics,GRK024,5.0,3.0,"Professor Lurie is a fantastic educator and erudite professor. He has a true sense of passion for the material and always makes himself available to students whenever they need him. He expects students to work hard and put in the requisite effort, but any student who is willing to do so will be fairly rewarded."
11043,2021893,Michael,Lurie,Dartmouth College,Classics,CLST2,2.0,3.0,"This would have been a great course had I not felt personally attacked by Professor Lurie. I did not finish the course due to his blatant disrespect. He doesn't care about students' difficulties at all, it's all about the texts and material to him. If you have any personal issues that arise, do not expect him to be accommodating in any way."
11044,2021893,Michael,Lurie,Dartmouth College,Classics,CLST2,1.5,3.0,This is one of those classes that has great potential in terms of topic but fails in delivery due to the professor. Professor Lurie is not particularly respectful towards his students (tone of voice or emails). He clearly cares a lot about the material but he doesn't care about the students. Below average classics class for Dartmouth.
11046,24784,Laurence,Davies,Dartmouth College,English,ENG123,5.0,3.0,Professor Davies is great!
11047,24784,Laurence,Davies,Dartmouth College,English,COCO33,5.0,2.0,"This man is a minor deity among profs.  Never before had I been so enthralled, so engaged or so challenged.  Every class I've taken with him has been interesting.  Also, he's funny as heck, his off-the-cuff quips are great and he seems to know everything about everything.  Each time a student brought up an obscure subject, he'd have a book on it!"
11048,24784,Laurence,Davies,Dartmouth College,English,IRISHFICTION,3.5,2.0,"Does tend to ramble at times, but it can be quite interesting.  His biggest weakness is that he allows students too much time to talk during class, and they end up saying foolish things.  Overall, I strongly recommend him."
11049,24784,Laurence,Davies,Dartmouth College,English,IRISHLIT,3.0,1.0,this guy rambles. absolute warning.
11050,24784,Laurence,Davies,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLISH66,5.0,4.0,"Great guy who knows his material- I enjoyed his lectures a lot. The class I had him for was painfully quiet, either because people refused to speak or Davies didn't ask the right questions. Watch out, he actually grades FAIRLY! bah!"
11051,24784,Laurence,Davies,Dartmouth College,English,COLT65,4.5,4.0,Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic.

11059,148359,Adrian,Randolph,Dartmouth College,Art History,ARTH40,4.5,5.0,"Absolutely lovely! Brilliant and interesting. Clearly entranced by his subject and trying to spread the joy. Also, a terrific person and very helpful to students. Don't be shy in this class- question, comment- you'll regret it if you don't. Can change the way you look at art and at history."
11060,148359,Adrian,Randolph,Dartmouth College,Art History,ARTSECT,5.0,1.0,witty and sharp. my favorite person at dartmouth.
11062,148359,Adrian,Randolph,Dartmouth College,Art History,ARTH2,4.5,3.0,"This was an incredible class.  Unfortunately, I was sick and missed class for two weeks.  After I was back, he had me sit with him in his office until I understood most of what I'd missed, and we also got into a great discussion about Dartmouth architecture.  This guy was awesome."
11064,665191,Misagh,Parsa,Dartmouth College,Sociology,SOCY22,4.5,4.0,"I took 2 courses with Prof. Parsa  (Democracy+Development). He's the best prof ever! His courses are very interesting and he's passionate when teaching them. He's also very helpful, knowledgeable and has a great sense of humor. His courses emphasize the political and economic aspects of a given phenomenon, so if you like GOV, Parsa is the man!"
11065,665191,Misagh,Parsa,Dartmouth College,Sociology,MALS0001,5.0,3.0,His personality is amazing. He'll definitely keep you entertained.
11066,665191,Misagh,Parsa,Dartmouth College,Sociology,SOCY22,5.0,4.0,"If you are someone seeking knowledge, someone who loves critical thinking Parsa is a wonderful professor"
11067,665191,Misagh,Parsa,Dartmouth College,Sociology,MALS307,4.5,4.0,One of the best professors I've ever had. He presents things clearly and makes material exciting.
11068,665191,Misagh,Parsa,Dartmouth College,Sociology,MALS307,4.0,3.0,"Parsa is a great professor at the graduate level. So long as you are open-minded and semi-aware of what you're signing up for, you will like him. He has a lot of energy and explains things in easy to understand language. Great professor."
11069,665191,Misagh,Parsa,Dartmouth College,Sociology,SOCY67,1.5,3.0,"Social Movements was hands down the worst class I took at Dartmouth. It sounded like an interesting course from the description, but Parsa was an awful professor. I'm a fairly liberal guy, but Parsa's lectures consisted of irrational left-wing rants and th"
11070,674827,Ronald,Edsforth,Dartmouth College,History,MALS,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever. Coming from a student who's taken great Professors at great universities. Not accommodating at all - poor ability to lecture -- and lame class structure. Avoid at all costs.
11071,674827,Ronald,Edsforth,Dartmouth College,History,MALS,5.0,3.0,"Ron is passionate and engaged professor who cares deeply about his students. He makes his opinions clear, which some may find off-putting, but it is refreshing to see someone who does not give in to the neutral for the sake of being neutral expectation."
11072,674827,Ronald,Edsforth,Dartmouth College,History,MALS,2.0,4.0,He was good to begin with but towards the end was horrible. Also he needs to talk loudly and wear some deodorant
11073,674827,Ronald,Edsforth,Dartmouth College,History,MALS240,2.0,2.0,One of the wost professors I have ever had.  He's a nice guy but is a terrible teacher.  If you don't agree with him he'll interrupt you in class.  He wants to make everything into economics rather than focusing on the critical social issues at hand.
11074,674827,Ronald,Edsforth,Dartmouth College,History,MALS244,3.0,5.0,"Ron is  a good professor, but if you don't agree with him, you won't do well. I didn't learn much in class because all you have to do well is recapitulate what he preaches in class. Good guy, but not too open-minded."
11076,691628,Jonathan,Crewe,Dartmouth College,English,ENG72,3.5,3.0,hes awesome
11077,691628,Jonathan,Crewe,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL21,4.0,5.0,Really sweet guy. I was not paying as much attention in his class as I should and he called me to his office to let me know I should be writing better papers and that he was ready to help... really appreciated. But know that he does have high standards/is a hard grader.
11078,691628,Jonathan,Crewe,Dartmouth College,English,HUM02,5.0,5.0,A very charming gentleman
11080,691628,Jonathan,Crewe,Dartmouth College,English,ENG027,3.0,5.0,"He lectures for two hours twice a week. No matter how good of a lecturer you are, you can never keep students attention that long. He's brilliant and a nice guy, but he puts half of his students to sleep. He is a harsh grader, too."
11081,691628,Jonathan,Crewe,Dartmouth College,English,ENG14,4.5,2.0,Professor Crewe is a pleasing combination of being exceedingly erudite and ridiculously sweet.

11083,691630,Nancy Jay,Crumbine,Dartmouth College,English,ENG7,4.5,4.0,"My favorite professor ever. Take this class. It will change your life. I was terrified going into it because of all the negative comments, but the work was worth it. She is the reason I have chosen to be an English major. To be fair, it is one of the hardest classes you will ever take, and you writing will be torn apart an destroyed, but in the end you will be a better writer than you could have imagined. Take this class."
11084,691630,Nancy Jay,Crumbine,Dartmouth College,English,WRIT04,3.5,4.0,"amazing prof, this class will change your life."
11085,691630,Nancy Jay,Crumbine,Dartmouth College,English,WRIT5,4.0,4.0,"She has high standards and assigns a lot of work, but she knows she tends to over-assign so if you talk to her she'll help you out with what you should definitely be doing and with what you might be struggling with. She's super smart, I learned SO MUCH in this class that's helped me throughout college. Can be intimidating, but actually "
11086,691630,Nancy Jay,Crumbine,Dartmouth College,English,WRIT005,5.0,3.0,Amazing prof.

11088,987155,Kamiar,Abdi,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH7,3.5,4.0,"I took this class several years ago, but Professor Abdi was one of the better professors I had while attending Dartmouth.  I really enjoyed this class, it was partially responsible for my decision to add an anthropology major."
11089,987155,Kamiar,Abdi,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH24,5.0,4.0,Prof. Abdi's Ancient Egypt is one of the best courses offered at Dartmouth. Highly recommended.
11090,987155,Kamiar,Abdi,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH24,5.0,4.0,This guy is amazing. He can lecture with such energy and enthusiasm --without a single note -- just from memory that sometimes he seems like a preacher. Very happy I took his class.
11091,987155,Kamiar,Abdi,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH24,5.0,4.0,"I took Prof. Abdi's Ancient Egypt class two years ago. Then I thought it was too much information to absorb in a survey course, but in retrospect and having seen 10,000 B.C. I realized how much I learned in this class. Thank you Prof. Abdi."
11092,987155,Kamiar,Abdi,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH23,4.5,3.0,"Great class, awesome sense of humor, learned a lot and had a lot of fun...thanx."
11093,987155,Kamiar,Abdi,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH5,5.0,3.0,"Very smart, friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful. One of the best professors at Dartmouth (unlike some of the dickheads who've been around for eons and wont go away to open room for likes of Abdi)"
11094,1154925,Alexander,Rimberg,Dartmouth College,Physics,PHYS13,5.0,2.0,Great professor.
11095,1154925,Alexander,Rimberg,Dartmouth College,Physics,PHYS13,5.0,2.0,"Fun guy. Explains stuff pretty well. Before taking his class, I had read everywhere about consistently negative reviews about him. Maybe he has changed personality, but I found him to be awesome."
11096,1154925,Alexander,Rimberg,Dartmouth College,Physics,PHYS41,1.5,2.0,"Bad overall grading, easy going and unfair"
11097,1154925,Alexander,Rimberg,Dartmouth College,Physics,PHYS41,1.5,1.0,Worse instructor in physics I ever had
11099,1154925,Alexander,Rimberg,Dartmouth College,Physics,PHYS47,2.0,1.0,Very marginal instructor. He seems interested only to do research in his laboratory.
11100,1328934,Hany,Farid,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS1,3.5,2.0,"Hany is very funny and clear,, you will really understand his lectures and you can do well in the course. However, he doesn't personally interact well with or care about his students, and makes it clear that he doesn't even make an effort to learn names. Only wish he could have been more approachable"
11101,1328934,Hany,Farid,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS1,2.5,2.0,overrated. doesn't really care about students.
11102,1328934,Hany,Farid,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS10,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed his teaching. Overall a great prof.
11103,1328934,Hany,Farid,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS10,5.0,3.0,Really enjoyed his teaching.
11104,1328934,Hany,Farid,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COSC01,5.0,2.0,Great Prof.
11105,1328934,Hany,Farid,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS15,5.0,4.0,One of the more enjoyable professors I ever had

11107,2064911,Brock,Christensen,Dartmouth College,Biology,PEM103,2.5,2.0,"Good guy, clearest of the profs who taught, not patient though"
11108,2064911,Brock,Christensen,Dartmouth College,Biology,PEM103,2.5,4.0,Decent statistics background
11109,2064911,Brock,Christensen,Dartmouth College,Biology,QBS110,2.5,3.0,Solid research

11112,265513,David,Glueck,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM064,5.0,1.0,Loved Inorganic with Glueck! The labs were amazing too
11113,265513,David,Glueck,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM64,2.5,5.0,"While clearly a brilliant chemist, his lectures are rather monotanous and his monotone voice does not help the student know what is important to the class. I found his classes difficult as his tests are truly monsters. His Chem 6 class is good but definetly harder than others. His 64 class is hard, filled with premeds and majors."
11114,265513,David,Glueck,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEMISTRY6,3.0,4.0,"I found his teaching style very bland and uninteresting.  All he did was lecture and his jokes were not funny. His lectures were confusing and overwhelming, however, he did help me when I went to office hours.  His tests are RIDICULOUS!!!!!  There is no reason why his tests should be that hard because the homeworks are not even that hard!  Boo!"
11115,265513,David,Glueck,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM6,5.0,3.0,Very funny guy and extremely organized.  He makes the material very easy to understand.  Highly recommend his class.
11116,265513,David,Glueck,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM664,5.0,1.0,Clear and helpful.  Also HOT!
11118,597683,Hoyt,Alverson,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH003,1.0,4.0,Alverson is the worst prof I have ever had at Dartmouth. He purposely used superfluous language to make himself feel superior. The tests had little to do with lectures or readings. It is surprising this man is an anthropology prof given his extremely low emotional intelligence. This low E.I. makes him a horrible teacher for anyone trying to learn.
11119,597683,Hoyt,Alverson,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,CULTURALANTH,5.0,5.0,Also had him for African Experience and Language and Culture
11120,597683,Hoyt,Alverson,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTHRO03,1.5,3.0,Couldn't answer his short answer tests the way he wanted and paid for it.
11121,597683,Hoyt,Alverson,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH3,2.0,2.0,"This is one of those crappy professors that makes you buy the book that he wrote because he wrote it.  Not only that, he makes you buy the book by his wife...about him.  If you want a nap, take this class.  The egomaniac never failed to put me to sleep."
11122,628977,David,Laguardia,Dartmouth College,Languages,FRENCH,5.0,4.0,"Professor LaGuardia is easily the most brilliant professor in the entire French and Italian Department. Although French fluency among students range from native to beginner's, he can masterfully conduct a class that engages everyone. He's perspicacious, intellectual, yet relaxed, and doesn't have OCD like others. He's generous, caring, brilliant."
11123,628977,David,Laguardia,Dartmouth College,Languages,FRENC30,3.5,2.0,"Please, one of the best profs at Dartmouth? This guy doesn't even know what he's talking about! He extrapolates some half baked theories based on some articles he's read, and when you point out the flaws in his arguments he just cannot let it go.  Not smart.  Nice enough guy.  Also a snob"
11124,628977,David,Laguardia,Dartmouth College,Languages,COLT072,2.5,2.0,Not exactly the best professor at Dartmouth. Take any theory course with him and you'll see.
11126,628977,David,Laguardia,Dartmouth College,Languages,FRENCH,5.0,3.0,"Great Guy, totally laid back and brilliant. His lectures always seem to fly by and he thoughtfully considers students' input. One of the best profs at Dartmouth. If you have a chance to go to France on one of the FSP or LSA programs with him, definitely do it."
11127,721755,Marcelo,Gleiser,Dartmouth College,Physics,PHY101,5.0,1.0,Inspirational!
11128,721755,Marcelo,Gleiser,Dartmouth College,Physics,PHYS016,4.0,3.0,"Funny and really smart. E&amp;M is boring, but Marcelo made the class interesting."
11129,721755,Marcelo,Gleiser,Dartmouth College,Physics,ASTROPHYS,1.5,2.0,"Even for the low teaching standards at Dartmouth, Gleiser is a marginal instructor. He seems to think to be a novel Einstein, and teaches accordingly."
11130,721755,Marcelo,Gleiser,Dartmouth College,Physics,ADVANCEDQM,1.0,4.0,"Gleiser is an incoherent lecturer, an unfair grader, and not helpful outside of class. He is also extremely full of himself."

11133,770515,Cynthia,Huntington,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL81,5.0,4.0,"REALLY good feedback, very understanding. I love having her look at my work and I've learned a lot about being a writer in this class. Don't take her comments personally (you can't in any CW class) because she's trying to help you learn, and explains concepts way more effectively than most other CW profs."
11134,770515,Cynthia,Huntington,Dartmouth College,English,CREATIVEWRITIN,5.0,3.0,Very dedicated to helping her students. Very knowledgeble about the subject matter.

11136,770515,Cynthia,Huntington,Dartmouth College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,Best prof at Dartmough.
11137,312219,Patricia,McKee,Dartmouth College,English,ENGLISH38,2.0,3.0,"Lots of awkward silences because she never seemed to prepare lectures.  She's also the only prof I've ever had who used students' personal analyses in her few lectures, taking the credit for herself.  Least ethical prof I've ever had.  If you do have her -- you get the highest essay grades for regurgitating material."
11139,312219,Patricia,McKee,Dartmouth College,English,ENG72,5.0,3.0,Professor McKee is really smart and really helpful at the same time.  She really cares about her students and is very sincere.
11141,1111590,Dale,Eickelman,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH036,1.0,4.0,I would never suggest to anyone that they take a class with Professor Eickelman. He's a poor professor who thinks far too highly of himself. His lectures were the worst part of my Dartmouth experience.
11143,1111590,Dale,Eickelman,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTH33,1.0,5.0,"Amen brother...not just an aweful professor, but an obnoxious human being. KICK HIM OUT RIGHT NOW!!!"
11144,1111590,Dale,Eickelman,Dartmouth College,Anthropology,ANTHX,1.0,5.0,"The most pompous, arrogant SOB on the face of the planet. Treats students like****. Eickelman should be fired and tried for crimes against humanity!"
11145,1169018,Eric,Hansen,Dartmouth College,Engineering,ENGS23,3.0,5.0,He is so hard and his book is not good at all.
11146,1169018,Eric,Hansen,Dartmouth College,Engineering,ENGS47,4.5,4.0,I struggled so hard in this class but Prof. Hansen was always there to help me/my partner out. He's really nice (very sweet) and really cares about doing the best for his students.
11147,1169018,Eric,Hansen,Dartmouth College,Engineering,ENGS92,4.5,3.0,I have the highest regards and respect for Professor Hansen. He wrote the classroom text and teaches with the highest degrees of ethics and attention to detail.
11149,1293385,Jimmy,WU,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM52,4.5,5.0,"Wu teaches Chem 52 and he is a great professor, but the material is extremely difficult and he sometimes rushes thorough the material, still expecting you to understand it on exams."
11150,1293385,Jimmy,WU,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,LAB247,2.0,3.0,Do not work for this guy.  He sucks.
11151,1293385,Jimmy,WU,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM58,5.0,4.0,Awesome professor. Extremely helpful. Crystal clear. Super nice guy.
11152,1293385,Jimmy,WU,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM52,5.0,4.0,He's just awesome.

11156,1507530,Gordon,Gribble,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM93,5.0,3.0,Organic chemistry isn't my favorite subject but Professor Gribble is just a fantastic person.  Very knowledgeable and interesting.
11157,1507530,Gordon,Gribble,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM51,5.0,4.0,Great professor! really helpful and nice. made the material really interesting.
11158,24789,John,Pfister,Dartmouth College,Psychology,PSYC007,5.0,2.0,The most helpful teacher/professor I have  ever had for writing.  I have grown so much as a writer through his freshman seminar.  I highly recommend going in to talk with him often as his comments into writing are both insightful and informative.
11159,24789,John,Pfister,Dartmouth College,Psychology,PSYCH10,5.0,2.0,"He really cares about his students and you can tell he is passionate about the subject. I thought his jokes were funny and he tries very hard. Office hours were always helpful and he explains things very well and never makes you feel like you asked a stupid question. Good class, fantastic professor, decent amount of reading, average tests."
11160,24789,John,Pfister,Dartmouth College,Psychology,PSYC10,5.0,3.0,"I really didn't want to take stats, but this guy made it fun.  He may be the best professor I've ever had.  Really cares about his students and his subject."
11161,265517,John,Winn,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM005,3.5,5.0,"Professor Winn is extremely nice and helpful, uses the chalk board a lot rather than slideshows which I found to be a refreshing change from the norm. The material in chem 5 is very difficult though."
11162,265517,John,Winn,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM81,1.0,5.0,"He is lame to do research, that is why he tries to pretend to be nice to gain the favor of unders."
11163,265517,John,Winn,Dartmouth College,Chemistry,CHEM81,5.0,1.0,Very nice and a good teacher.  Much more helpful than his book.
11164,286676,Marlene,Heck,Dartmouth College,Fine Arts,WRIT5,5.0,4.0,"Heck high expectations but rewards hard work, even if you are just learning how to be a student at Dartmouth. Best experience I've had to date, in or out of the classroom."
11165,286676,Marlene,Heck,Dartmouth College,Fine Arts,WRIT5,5.0,4.0,"She has very high expectations, and will call you out if you're just sliding by in the course. But she also is extremely eager to help students succeed, and her ability to lead class discussions is excellent."
11166,286676,Marlene,Heck,Dartmouth College,Fine Arts,ARTH52,5.0,4.0,Best I had at Dartmouth
11167,597700,David,Kotz,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COSC50,1.0,5.0,"Such a bad professor. Do not take it with him. Arrogant, cold, and cannot teach."
11168,597700,David,Kotz,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,CS37,2.5,5.0,"Took CS37 and CS78 from him.  The median grade on the exams for CS37 was something like a 50, so that should tell you a lot.  Did not do a great job actually teaching us the material"
11169,597700,David,Kotz,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COSC78,5.0,2.0,Best CS class offered.  Finally a class where you don't spend 3/4 of it proving O(n) for something and only 1/4 learning real stuff that you might use!  Take this class.  You won't regret it.
11170,642919,Andrew,McCann,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL54,4.5,3.0,"As it was my 2nd course with McCann, I knew what I was getting into, but was still very impressed with the quality and insights provided. The assignments were interesting and supplemented the readings well. I appreciated the insight into different literary contexts and theoretical frameworks. Very thought-provoking and life-changing. TAKE THIS."
11171,642919,Andrew,McCann,Dartmouth College,English,ENGL23,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful professor. Lectures are clear and insightful, assignments are reasonable, and reading is manageable (mostly poetry). He does not micromanage you with the papers (length and frequency) or attendance/participation, which I appreciated. Wry sense of humor and really caring. Most importantly, he got me invested in romanticism and poetry!"
11172,642919,Andrew,McCann,Dartmouth College,English,ENG007,3.5,2.0,"I have no interest in Literature or poetry, but still the classes were interesting and you have to pay attention because you can get called on randomly"

11186,698787,John L.,Campbell,Dartmouth College,Sociology,SOCY69,5.0,4.0,Professor Campbell's classes have great balance between well delivered lectures and facilitated class discussions. Students are evaluated in Socy 69 by 2 take home exams and 1 research project. His grading criteria is clear. Do not expect to get a good grade without doing the readings and spending time on research/writing. Expect to learn a lot!
11187,698787,John L.,Campbell,Dartmouth College,Sociology,SOCY1,4.0,3.0,"Lots of reading (a book a week or so), but Campbell chooses books that are actually interesting and relevant to the material. Campbell's a really good lecturer, but make sure you either (1) go to class or (2) have a friend who takes really good notes, because otherwise you won't have any way of getting the material. "

It was a 6-student First Year seminar with a sexy title: Persia Iran, Images &amp; Reality. It met after lunch. Prof. came in stinking of onions &amp; mustard.

11219,1826310,Gevorg,Grigoryan,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COS186,1.0,4.0,Seriously he can't explain things well. He expects you to know everything of what he is teaching.
11220,1826310,Gevorg,Grigoryan,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COS189,1.5,5.0,"Can't figure out why a biology course was set in CS department. All your classmates will be from bio dept. Be careful CS dude, if you don't have strong bio background, then don't go for it."

11225,1411645,Kevin,Peterson,Dartmouth College,Biology,BIOL11,5.0,3.0,"Literally the GOAT such an engaging teacher, decent class and pretty hard but prof Peterson literally made this my favorite class. Very engaging, and really nice person. The one thing to be aware of is that he sometimes cold calls people. Other than this best prof ever."
11226,1411645,Kevin,Peterson,Dartmouth College,Biology,BIOL06,4.0,4.0,I absolutely loved this class! It was more focused on cladistics and the dinosaur tree than I was expecting but it was a really neat way to learn about evolution through the lens of dinosaurs. You definitely have to put the effort in studying because he makes it clear what he wants you to know. You've got to do the work to succeed in this class.
11227,1411645,Kevin,Peterson,Dartmouth College,Biology,BIOL06,3.0,5.0,"A nice enough professor, but ""Dinosaurs"" was not what I had expected. He focused mainly on dinosaur cladistics, classifying them into various groups/subgroups/etc. based on their physical characteristics. I didn't find this approach illuminating for an introductory course, and the exams on cladograms were extraordinarily nitpicky and difficult."

11236,29928,Erland,Schulson,Dartmouth College,Engineering,MATERIALS,2.0,3.0,Professor Schulson knowns his material but is one of the worst professor I have ever encountered.  Feel free to ask around as to whether or not to take his class...I'm sure most students will agree not to.
11238,240606,Fillia,Makedon,Dartmouth College,Computer Science,COSC099,5.0,3.0,I learned many things in her class about HCI that I will never forget.  Thank you

11246,597689,Lee,Lynd,Dartmouth College,Engineering,ENGS22,1.0,3.0,"This class was truly horrible. Maybe Lee Lynd can set up a lab to do biofuels, but as a professor and a person he is horrendous. It sickens me how much disrespect he has for others. Towards students he is rude and arrogant. He didn't bother to show up for majority of the course. "
11247,597689,Lee,Lynd,Dartmouth College,Engineering,ENGS22,4.5,2.0,I found this class to be very useful in giving an idea about what all the different engineering disciplines involve.  Great class.  Good prof.
11248,636005,William,Wade,Dartmouth College,Science,MICRO264,4.5,4.0,"A great professor. Is hard on student who don't want to put in the effort to learn, but if asked for help he will bend over backwards to make sure that a student understands. Doesn't post lecture slides but will send to students if asked; he just doesn't want people skipping class."

11258,759721,Jonna,MacKin,Dartmouth College,English,WRIT5,1.5,4.0,"She is well-versed in critical analysis, as she has listed off her credentials multiple times in class. Still, she comes off as insecure quite often and is often wasteful of class time. She has been known to be rude, and she tends to talk around problems rather than addressing them. Students pretend to listen; syllabus very unclear."
11259,759721,Jonna,MacKin,Dartmouth College,English,WRITING5,4.5,4.0,"She's a tough grader, that much is true.  She definitely doesn't have any tolerance for things such as tardiness, missing class, missing deadlines etc...But she is also very reasonable, will work hard with you to make you a better writer, and is not out to make your life horrible.  She just pushes you hard, so you can get the most out of the class."
11260,803090,Sam,Levey,Dartmouth College,Philosophy,PHIL31,5.0,3.0,"Professor Levey was terrific, a really thoughtful professor who sought to engage the class.  He was also welcoming and kind in office hours --- someone striving to develop your thought process."

11264,886248,James,Feyrer,Dartmouth College,Economics,ECON22,5.0,2.0,"Walk into the middle of a J Fey class and you're gonna be looking at something akin to a war room, with tons of graphs and drawings on the blackboard and slides flying by at a blistering pace. Amazing lecturer, but he needs to go a WHOLE lot slower in clas. Then again, that's what office hours are for, and Feyrer is definitely there to help you."
11267,895055,Jody,Trout,Dartmouth College,Mathematics,MATH010,1.0,3.0,Very very dissapointing.
11268,915284,Carl,Pomerance,Dartmouth College,Mathematics,MATH3,1.0,4.0,i dont know what that person was talking about but he was not a good math prof at all. i could name the four math teachers i had in high school and i would take them over him anyday.

11270,915288,Vladimir,Chernov,Dartmouth College,Mathematics,MATH23,1.5,4.0,"All seemed to go well until week 3, at which point he shifted the class' focus from real-world applications to obscure and narrowly applicable proofs. Good presence and witty commentary, but treats in-class questions with a fiercely derisive and hostile attitude, which is even worse during office hours. Do not take his 23 if you are PHYS/CHEM/ENGS"
11271,915288,Vladimir,Chernov,Dartmouth College,Mathematics,MATH23,4.0,3.0,"Great prof.  Once you get past his accent, he explains ideas clearly and logically.  He prepared lecture notes for us, to be handed out before each class, which were very helpful."

Top notch!"
11274,1013386,Allen,Koop,Dartmouth College,History,HIST36,5.0,3.0,"Very interesting topic but not advised to take freshman year... great structure and straightforward. Speak up, skim readings and you will be just fine."

24410,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAMAE10,5.0,4.0,Remo is the best professor I have EVER had in any subject. He is incredibly passionate about his students and the art of acting. This course requires complete participation -- read the text (it's great!) And do all of the work and I promise you will grow and have a stronger understanding of the material. I honestly can't recommend him enough.
24411,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAMS140,5.0,3.0,"I took a public speaking with professor Remo, and it was incredibly inspiring and I benefited a lot from the class. Remo always tries to help you and he is always on your side to help make it through any difficulty, but you have to do the reading assignment, because if you dont you will have a lot of difficulties in studying for the final."
24412,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAMA117,5.0,4.0,"A brilliant teacher who inspires every single student he works with.

24418,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAM140,5.0,4.0,"The most inspirational professor I have ever taken a class with.  For many, this class becomes life changing; classmates who struggled to speak in public at the start were transformed by 'Remo' - as he insists on being called -into highly confident speakers.  I was humbled by his devotion to the class.  He is strict on attendance  &amp; participation."
24419,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAM140,5.0,3.0,I  took Remo's Public Speaking class and have never had a better educational experience. He is completely dedicated to making all his students excel and the amount of time and energy he devoted to each and every one of us was astounding. He also happens to be hilarious and as kind a person as you're likely to meet. Great teacher.

24421,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAMAE12,5.0,3.0,"Amazing class. I'd highly recommend this course  to anyone contemplating the pursuit of any dramatical studies. Professor Airaldi is not only knowledgable  and experience, but he draws the best out of every student.  p.s. Good luck with getting into this course as it's extremely competitive.  "
24422,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAMAE12,5.0,4.0,Remo's Shakespeare class was spectacular. He is a fantastic teacher.
24423,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAMAE10,5.0,3.0,"Remo is an incredibly warm, welcoming individual, who has a talent for bringing out the best performances in actors. He is a joy to work with and learn from. Unbelievably inspiring and generous. Superlatives are truly not sufficient."
24424,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAMA,5.0,3.0,"I took a class with Remo this semester after reading all the amazing reviews (and having him be recommended to me by many friends). All I can say is, no one was exaggerating. He is beyond belief, both as a teacher and a person. You would be a fool not to take any class taught by him. I never left class less than totally inspired."
24425,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAM120,5.0,4.0,Wonderful WONDERFUL teacher. I guarantee you will enjoy and learn SO MUCH from this class. Although it can be a little nerve racking at first will all the speeches you will have to do. I'll be worth it. Don't be afraid to meet with him. He is AMAZING and will show you so much. It is an awesome experience. I really did wish it could go on.
24426,1406187,Remo,Airaldi,Harvard University,Theater,DRAM120,5.0,4.0,"Never in my life I saw so much commitment to a job. REMO's true passion is to help students develop. He challenges  everybody, still fair, according to the actual speaking skills. This course was one of the most valuable experiences of my life. REMO has become one of my personal heros and my deepest wish is to never loose contact to this great man."
24428,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO20,5.0,5.0,Amazing! Best professor I have ever had!
24429,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO20,5.0,5.0,"Great with feedback! I love when professors take the time to examine the work us students put in, and actually help. Both a great educator as well as a facilitator! Thank you, Sri!"
24430,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO20,5.0,5.0,"Sri's method is not very productive for some, but extremely effective for others (like me). She gives extensive written feedback and pays very careful attention to your writing. I came into expos knowing I was going to suffer (not a fan of writing), but Sri made it much more manageable. I learned so much with her that I started even enjoying it!"
24431,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,4.0,"Sri is a superb Expos preceptor who truly cares about her students' academic and scholarly growth. She teaches a rigorous and demanding curriculum that requires students to formulate compelling papers with well structured and progressive ideas, and she is effective. Most of all, her feedback on student work is impeccable and enormously thorough."
24432,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Mukherjee is one of the best instructors at Harvard. Her teaching was largely responsible for bringing my academic writing skills up to a whole new level. Her instruction combines peer analysis, class discussion, and lectures, couched in a literary context, and her feedback on our writing was meticulous and enormously helpful."
24433,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,4.0,"Sri was one of the most helpful and instructive professors I've ever had. I learned to craft arguable, sophisticated theses &amp; support my essays with a complex progression of ideas. I also greatly improved my critical thinking and analysis skills. She was not only skilled but passionate about her field, inspiring me to pursue the humanities!"
24434,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,4.0,"Sri's selection and analysis of sample essays that applied ""complicateextendcounter"" moves to the authors' ideas really helped me with synthesizing how multiple texts spoke to one another instead of simply reading a source in isolation and laying out what the author's argument was."
24435,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20066,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Mukherjee's class was immensely helpful in honing my skills as a writer. Prior to Expos 20.066, I frequently got away with writing ""flowery"" essays filled with SAT words. That doesn't cut it for Dr. Mukherjee. This isn't a highscool writing class. Dr. Mukherjee, always willing to help but never willing to handhold, is a superb expos preceptor."
24436,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,4.0,"Sri is an exceptionally talented instructor. Sri is aware that new concepts she presents take time to implement and gives thorough explanations on how to effectively support &amp; advance arguments. I appreciate her clear expectations, both verbal and written, and her thoughtful feedback. Iâ€™m a different reader, writer, and thinker after this course."
24437,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,3.0,"Sri Mukherjee is one of Harvard's gems. She is not only lucid in her manner of conveying key ideas, but also genuinely cares about her students' success. She met with me several times outside of class and provided extensive feedback on my work. Two years later, her writing strategies continue to be essential tools in my academic writing at Harvard."
24438,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,4.5,3.0,Sri Mukherjee is a highly intelligent and very talented teacher. Most college freshman do not have high school English experiences that prepare them for college level writing. Professor Mukherjee helped me to make this transition smoothly. She helps you to advance your essay and writing using methods applicable and useful in all college writing.
24439,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,3.0,"On 5/12/11, I submitted a rating on ratemyprofessors.com. Much to my dismay, I realized that I gave Professor Mukherjee 1's in Helpfulness and Clarity, when my intent was to give her the HIGHEST ratings (This is VERY clear in my comment section). Consequently, I registered to ratemyprofessors.com to modify my error. She is one of Harvard's best!"
24440,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOSMW,5.0,4.0,"Sri is an brilliant and engaging professor who teaches students to create strong academic arguments and guides students in the transition to scholarly writing. Her class and feedback is focused on ideas and skills rather than mechanics, which allows students to apply her revisions to all of their papers rather than just her assignments."
24441,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOSMW,5.0,4.0,"Sri is an incredibly engaging  professor. She guides students to arrive at their own ideas and is very knowledgeable about cultural interactions. Her class is very much idea driven, and her feedback on papers focuses on writing skills rather than the prompt, which allows students to grow into their own style as they progress from paper to paper."
24442,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOSEXPO,5.0,3.0,"Sri is a very personal professor.She works with your strengths and identifies and resolves your weaknesses.She guides students rather than being authoritative, and allows us to grow as opposed to being forced in a particular direction.Her attention to detail is excellent and the amount of individual attention she gives each student is unparalleled."
24443,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,4.0,"I have just completed my writing course in Harvard summer school with Dr. Mukherjee. She is resourceful, amiable and eager to offer help outside the classroom. The course is fantastic and I have learned the essence of college academic writing through this fast-paced course. Thank you so much, Dr. Mukherjee and I hope to work with you in the future."
24444,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO20,5.0,4.0,"completed 2nd week (12 hours)of summer expos 20 &amp; just finished first one on one conference. prof is very challenging &amp; engaging (plus cute). wish had similar conferences in my other course, really helpful"
24445,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,5.0,"Before Expos, I couldn?t even use a comma; bouncing between inner-city schools had avoided me writing an essay. Dr. M is not only clear, thorough(applying all concepts beyond Expos),and engaging, but dedicated. She constantly worked with me, even when off. Her dedication literally caught me up to a college writing level: by far my best teacher yet."
24446,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20,5.0,3.0,"Sri was an absolutely fanstastic teacher. Her instruction was precise and clear. Assignments were challenging, but we never lacked direction. Help was always available. I left the class feeling that I was a far better writer than when I'd started."
24447,1151909,Sri,Mukherjee,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOS20SM,5.0,4.0,"Sri is a superb teacher on all accounts. She adeptly factilitated class sessions to engage all students in rich discussions that continually challenged and expanded our understanding of course materials. Her thoughtful, thorough critiques of our work reflected her passion for teaching and her strong interest in students' growth."
24449,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,AIU55,5.0,4.0,"Disregard some of the more foolish reviewers on here! Prof. Garber gives some of the best lectures at Harvard (er, or probably at other Ivy). Knows Shakespeare inside and out. Reads the world like a book. Only downside is you really need to pay attention and be willing to, like, learn new words and stuff, otherwise you'll miss a lot."
24450,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENGL130,5.0,3.0,Nothing else to say about the professor.
24451,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENGS224,2.0,2.0,"Harvard assigned her Great Political Speeches to profit from the speechwriters market, but the course is a complete farce. She will always try to talk about Shakespeare when she feels insecure due to her ignorance about politics. Extremely old and lazy, never grades paper nor exam. The syllabus is a draft and she makes you buy books you wont use."
24452,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENG130,1.0,4.0,"I made a limerick for this class. It goes as follows:  Through college ranks we have risen,  To a class where no lecture was given,  So we begged Dr. Klug,  To teach Chem in the nude,  But he only answered with, ""Metacognition."""
24453,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENGL130,3.5,4.0,"Professor Garber was an excellent teacher who knew the material and knew how to guide a discussion. I learned more from her class than any other class. She wasn't overly friendly, but she was never rude or mean. I found her class very engaging."
24454,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENG138,1.0,5.0,She has a lot of frustration and she took it out on my grade. I did everything she asked and still did poorly. She is a mean mean person.
24455,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENGLE130,4.0,3.0,"I like this prof. Interesting, combines humor with academic material, covers things well. TAs seem almost bothered by having to be TAs tho, like it's beneath them; they do seem overwhelmed tho so maybe just stressed."
24456,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENG222,4.0,2.0,Fabolously brilliant! overwhelming literature for the kinddle minded! brilliant!
24457,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENG130,4.0,5.0,"Compelling and thought-provoking, traditional lecture format.  Clearly in command of the subject matter.  Sometimes makes spurious connections. A moat separates her from direct student contact.  Kind of harsh to her TAs.  Not warm &amp; fuzzy.  A ""rock star"" in her field but not very approachable.  Have your manager contact her's."
24458,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,ENG128,3.0,5.0,"Brilliant student of Shakespeare.  An excellent lecturer on Shakespeare.  Not such a great Shakespearean teacher.  I found that if you did not have a great amount of prior knowledge and study of Shakespeare's writings, then you would be seriously deficient.  I learned interesting things, but the testing was atrociously hard!"

Avoid this boring Skeletor creature at all costs."

24467,144541,Marjorie,Garber,Harvard University,English,LAA40,4.0,2.0,INCREDIBLE. The best class I have taken at Harvard yet. She is amazing. Grab any chance you have to take a class with her.

24470,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATHS23A,5.0,5.0,"This is the both the hardest and best class I have ever taken. Get ready to WORK. But Paul and his TA's are committed to helping you understand the material and there's lots of EC via learning R. The material is hard (know linear algebra and multivar calc BEFORE you come in), and the workload is grueling, but it was still an awesome experience."
24471,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23C,4.0,5.0,"Do not take this class as your first Harvard class. I spent almost 40 hours a week studying and still fell behind. I have a BSc in Elec Eng and an MBA. This is by far my most challenging class. Ever. There is a very steep learning curve if you are not familiar with proofs. Pay special attention to the prereqs, they are there for a reason."
24472,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23A,5.0,3.0,Great teacher and educator. Learned a lot from him and thoroughly enjoyed his lectures.
24473,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23B,5.0,4.0,"Im new to the math course system at Harvard, but I love this course. I was not planning to pursue any further than a minor in math since I plan to major in something else, but Pauls course changed my mind. This course is full of brilliant and hard working people and (thus naturally) very demanding. DONT PROCRASTINATE, YOULL TASTE THE PAIN."
24474,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23B,5.0,4.0,"Paul is an amazing professor! He really cares about his students and wants them to learn. If you work hard, you will get a lot out of any class you take with him."
24475,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23A,1.0,4.0,"Paul is an insecure guy who is constantly putting other people down and bragging about smart he is, and by implication, how dumb everyone else is. The class made me very anxious."
24476,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23A,5.0,3.0,"Paul is the best math professor I have ever had. Clearly a brilliant intellect with an immense passion for math and willingness to help anyone willing to work hard. Without question, you will need to put the time in, but it's a very rewarding experience."
24477,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH322,4.0,4.0,A great professor. He builds up my confidence to learn math and set up a good foundation for me to learn more advanced topics in analysis. The course is well designed and you have to spend times. But all materials are accessible and the exams are really similar to the problems that you have seen before.
24478,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23C,5.0,4.0,"Paul is a stellar professor. The course was very well-structured, with applications to numerous fields--probability, statistics, vector calc, analysis, linear algebra, etc.--and he managed to construct it from scratch in a single semester. I would strongly recommend the class if the subject matter is of greater interest to you than, say, 23B."
24479,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH191,1.0,2.0,not great
24480,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23A,4.5,3.0,"Paul has sparked my sense of wonder about math, while also making me feel capable of delving into higher-level courses. He's a great lecturer, but you likely won't understand all the material during class. Some of it's difficult  this is an intro to higher level math after all. A lot of work, but very fair grading and extra-credit abounds."
24481,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23A,2.5,5.0,"There is really low regard for wheter students are  understanding what is going on.  R-script the most awful program to do graphics in. Teaches from prepared notes on a projector, but covers what he is writing  with his hand  so it can not be seen. "

24483,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,PHYS2,5.0,2.0,"A truly inspiring teacher who motivated me to learn everything he had to teach. He expects a lot, but will bend over backwards to help you learn it. Exceptionally fair grader. He is an educator not a rubric tabulator. I studied physics, math, and computer science with him before going off to med. sch. and always wished that I had time to take more."
24484,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Professor Paul is awesome.He really likes it when you go ""BAMberg!!"" really loud.Huge Bowie fan and great teacher."

24487,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH23,4.5,2.0,"Disregard all the stuff about how bad of a teacher he is. If the 23 class of 2009-10 is any indication, the people who were most apt to complain were the ones who never really bothered to understand anything and instead tried to just memorize statements without the slightest comprehension. Paul's the man and explains stuff just fine. Nuff said."
24488,627131,Paul,Bamberg,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH116,3.5,5.0,"phenomenal interest-level.  great engagement.  not always easy to follow.  his lectures require a high level of attention, but are well structured and clear.  paul not an easy professor, by any means, but is incredibly fair and will help with literally anything you need, if asked."

24491,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,EC1040,1.0,5.0,Literally dropped out of Harvard because of this professor. Best of luck to those who wish to take his classes. Cant be me.
24492,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,EC1040,1.0,3.0,Took class last year and was disappointed with the unclear problem set instructions and a total difference in the material covered in Rajiv's TA sections versus the professors class. I do not recommend this class to anyone.
24493,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,EC1040,5.0,4.0,"All-around a wonderful professor who cares about the outcomes of his students. Take this class if you are passionate about learning and can take a challenge in stride. Make sure to attend the lectures, and devote a significant amount of time to the p-sets."
24494,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1010,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Most students don't recognize that going to his office hours allow him to talk one-on-one and help you explain concepts. I got an A+ and yes it is true that youtube could be an aid, but TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OFFICE HOURS. Tell him what you don't understand and he will explain the concept to you. Not the easiest A, but IT IS manageable"
24495,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1010,1.0,5.0,Never again. Hardest class ever
24496,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1010,1.0,5.0,DONT'T take this class!!! The class is based on one thing and the test is on another. I tried my best for this class and still did really bad. The TA doesn't give partial for the exams even he said he did. I basically taught myself for the entire period.
24497,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1050,2.5,3.0,"Hands down the worst class I took. Notation is important in this class, but he and his TA often teach DIFFERENT ways to notate, and then they will take off points if you use one by randomly choosing between the two it seems. Other discrepancies between lecture/section make this an infuriating experience. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS."
24498,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,E1010,2.0,5.0,"I graduated from the ALB program and Neugeboren's class is hands-down the hardest class I ever took at Harvard.  He has his TF teach new material at section (defeats the purpose of section, does it not?) and his problem sets are deceptively simple - you'll get excited that there are only 5 questions, but you'll spend 2 hours on each question."
24499,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1050,3.0,4.0,I like the boy!
24500,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECONS1010,3.0,5.0,"Prof. Neugeboren is a nice guy, and knows his stuff. He can be a little confusing at times, but the real misery in this course comes from the Psets and tests, both of which are completely brutal, and 100% written and graded by the TA. The Psets take at least 15 hours each to do, and are overcomplicated to say the very least. Would not take again. "
24501,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,E1010,4.5,3.0,a professional lecturer;  well organized lecture

24503,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1010,1.0,5.0,"Currently taking his ECON 1010. Probably the worst professor I have studied under. He is extremely knowledgable, but does not know how to teach."
24504,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1010,1.0,5.0,"Worst prof. ever!I really think Harvard should refund what I've paid for this class.  Textbook, lecture, and section won't help much for the homework and exams.  I was relied on lectures on the youtube and study materials from the GOOGLE.  If you have to take this course, make sure you have access to Google and Youtube, otherwise, you will fail."
24505,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,MICROE101,1.0,4.0,"Horrible. This class is not a theory class, but rather a calculus analytical one. He reads the slides and doesn't explain anything. When asked a question, he doesn't want to answer it. Problem sets ask questions that are not in his slides nor book he ""recommends' reading. Very poor value, you learn nothing valuable in this course."
24506,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1010,4.0,3.0,"I actually didn't think he was that bad. I thought he was good at teaching. Material was good, teaching was clear enough."
24507,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,EC1040,4.5,2.0,you'll never regret taking his class.
24508,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1050,4.0,3.0,"Expected him to be terrible, but he's actually pretty clear and his lectures are rather interesting!  Am I jumping up and down with excitement every lecture?  No, but I'm not falling asleep--nor am I completely lost.  His slides are really great too."
24509,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,ECONECON,1.0,3.0,Robert Neugeboren is perhaps the worst lecturer I have ever had.  His presentation of economics at the advanced level is disorganized and confusing.  I was left with the impression that he had no idea what he was talking about.  Perhaps that is why Harvard College relegated him to the Extension School.
24510,59877,Robert,Neugeboren,Harvard University,Economics,EC1010A,1.0,4.0,"Worst lecturer I've had in 3 years here. Disorganized, unclear.

24514,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,MBB152,5.0,3.0,"This was, hands down, the best class I have taken at Harvard.  Hauser inspired us all with passion, for tackling the apathy toward science, and for empowering us with our own ideas. His teaching is infectious, and so too is his warmth and interest in the students. If only more professors at Harvard could be so cool and interesting"

24518,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIENCEB29,5.0,4.0,"HE IS AMAZING.  Awesome lectures, incredible ideas... I hope I can have him again."
24519,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,B29,5.0,4.0,very cool. brilliant mind
24520,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB29,5.0,3.0,"i don't get the conceited comment below. Hauser is one of the few profs at harvard who is completely open to hanging out with students, is very approachable, and does freshman advising.  not many like him at harvard."
24521,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB29,1.0,2.0,"I second the HUGE ego, very limited expertise, lack of concern for rigorous empirical methods, leaves out all data not supporting his (unfailingly alpha male) perspective. Get ready to hear some very dull and very questionable theories and that bring to mind eugenics and other behavioral science debacles."
24522,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB29,3.5,4.0,"his lectures were pretty interesting, though because of the nature of the course, very broad.  he is considered to be pretty conceited, and i hate to say it shows."
24523,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCH,1.5,1.0,very boring. is there a point? or does he just like to hear his voice bounce off the walls? bring a pillow and get comfy. read all of his book and regurgitate it back and you'll excel
24524,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIENCEB29,5.0,3.0,Teaches with passion. Brilliant
24525,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB29,3.5,4.0,"Very clear lecturer, but ENORMOUS ego. He walks around like he owns the place."
24526,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,BS29,1.0,1.0,small man. big ego. he's not even a psychologist.
24527,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB29,4.0,5.0,"Very clear, good slides, funny stories. HOWEVER- He is on a crusade to lower the GPA of Harvard students- beware!Exams very difficult and tricky, section exams and readings are too many and too difficult for a core class.You'll end up knowing a lot though"
24528,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1152R,5.0,3.0,"this is the coolest lab. great people, really neat work, and lots of fun hanging out with hauser."
24529,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB29,5.0,3.0,really cool prof.  incredible understanding of material. loves teaching.
24530,64019,Marc,Hauser,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB29,3.5,4.0,"A fun course, changed the way I look at things.  Hauser is on the anti-grade inflation committee, and exams are very difficult.  Cotton-top tamarins with spray-painted hair rule."
24532,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,3.0,Shes one of the few professors that makes it where Id rather be in class than getting Raising Canes. She doesnt waste our time and wont let us waste hers. Its not an easy pass but the class is interesting so I dont feel most of the work I do.
24533,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,4.0,Professor Grimm was one of the best professors I have ever taken a course from. She challenges you to think outside the box but always loves hearing her student's thoughts. Grimm is hilarious and her lectures are insightful. If I could take more classes with her than I would. I would highly recommend her to anyone wanting to take a writing course.
24534,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,5.0,4.0,"She's everything others have described, and more! I feel fortunate for having had the opportunity to take her class. She's insightful, down to earth, authentic, and really knows how to challenge her students. She'll get the best out of you. All around, she's a fantastic lecturer with a wicked sense of humor and a genuine, sharp, critical mind."
24535,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,4.0,"Professor Grimm is an excellent instructor who truly wants all of her students to succeed. She's also funny, relatable, and always accessable via email. The course is intense, especially when taken in the 7 week summer session, and very time intensive. Pay close attention to the structure she provides at the beginning of the course."
24536,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,5.0,5.0,"Professor Grimm is awesome! She loves German literature - Kafka, Hesse, and Mann. Try to get a head start on the assigned readings. Professor Grimm likes original ideas and allows creative freedom as long as you can support it and follow her strict guidelines. Also, I recommend taking EXPO-E15 before taking EXPO-E25 at the Extension School."
24537,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor! Take her for EXPOE25! Class w/ her was fun! You're allowed 1 class to miss w/o penalty. Advice for new students: Follow her essay guidelines RELIGIOUSLY, have a tutor look over your work if possible, get a head starting on reading the req. readings prior to the first day, participate, and have fun with what you're working with!"
24538,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,4.0,4.0,I am studying Vet Meds and I think she is a excellent Professuer
24539,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,5.0,4.0,"You're very free to explore writing ideas with her.  What she wants to see from your writing is whether or not you can support her claim.  She cares very much about format, follow the guidelines religiously.  They are there because it will make you a better writer.  Participation MATTERS.  Speak up. Be prepared to re-read your assigned reading."
24540,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,4.0,Dr. Grimm is an outstanding professor. She is a Harvard graduate school professor that has taught classes at Harvard College and MIT. Her teaching skills are second to none. She gives clear instructions to students on how to write papers. Read and prepare for discussions. Dr. Grimm loves intellectually stimulating conversations. I love Dr. Grimm!
24541,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor! Dr. Grimm is amazing! She speaks very clearly and makes dull material interesting. She makes you really earn your grade. If her class was not mandatory, I still would have taken it. What I learned in her class, I will use for the rest of my life! All I can say is, ""Take her class, you will not regret it!!"""
24542,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,3.0,"Great professor and the one and only choice if you have to take EXPO E-25. If you follow her guidelines and re-write your essays (she does not accept drafts) until you are 100% d'accord, you will do well in her class. She is funny, like to talk a little about her life and gives you 1 second chance if you've submitted a very bad essay."
24543,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,5.0,3.0,"Concise, experienced, profound listening skills, patience of a saint, and all-around wonderful and memorable. Kafka, Siddhartha, German-lit."
24544,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,5.0,1.0,she's my hero
24545,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,E25,4.5,4.0,"Expository writing Professor with a focus on great German writers Mann, Hesse, and Kafka. She is tough but fair. We used Edgar Roberts book Writing about literature 13th ed. as a guide. Assignments need to be succinct no room for fluff. Overall great professor funny and engaged .  "
24546,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Fun, easy to understand, and helpful."
24547,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Grimm receives my highest recommendation. A metric example is given at the onset and the material lends itself well to the writing. Dr. Grimm is a master of making a subjective course as objective as possible. Class itself is a fun learning environment, however the structure is rigorous leaving one prepared for academic writing upon completion."
24548,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,3.0,"Super prof.  Class was very fun yet challenging.  All German lit used, so the readings are challenging.  Dr Grimm was very helpful &amp; informative.  My writing was 100% better after this class.  Very nice person as well.  Kind and friendly with a great sense of humor."
24549,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPO25,5.0,3.0,"EXPO is a mandatory class at Harvard Extension if you want to earn a degree, and the content depends on the instructor. Take it with this instructor- she doesn't drown you in reading, instead she makes you tear apart the assigned material and gives you great writing feedback."
24550,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,5.0,2.0,"Amazing! You have to take her Kafka, Hesse, Mann course."
24551,558623,Geraldine,Grimm,Harvard University,Writing,EXPOE25,4.0,3.0,"Great professor.  Her knowledge of german literature and german history is incredible and she has a lot of great insight.  She's funny, down to earth and a great person to get to know.  You work hard in her class, but discussions are fantastic and she really knows her stuff.  Absolutely recommended!"

24554,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,ER22,5.0,4.0,"I LOVE MICHAEL SANDEL SO, SO MUCH! HE'S THE BEST! WOWOWOWOWOW, HE'S JUST SO AWESOME, I CAN'T EVEN-!"
24555,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,ER22X,4.5,2.0,The best Course I have ever had.
24556,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,ER221X,5.0,4.0,Simply the most engaging and enlightening academic experience I have ever had.  Professor Sandel is a treasure.
24557,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,ER22X,5.0,3.0,"Easily the best class I've ever taken.  Professor Sandel is exemplary in his adeptness at the Socratic method; it's never about him, it's always about making the student justify his/her position.  If Professor Sandel is representative of Harvard faculty, I understand the high reputation of that establishment (if, not so much, the high pricetag)."
24558,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,ER22,5.0,1.0,"Sandel is GREAT. Besides the fact that the class is interesting, he engages people in a way that would really help them discover something about themselves and absorb what would  otherwise be a boring lesson in comparison."

24560,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,JUSTICE,3.0,3.0,"His class is pretty interesting, though it's hard not to miss the obvious liberal tilt and indoctrination. Although as a Harvard senior, I wouldn't expect anything less from this fine institution! Take him if you want an easy A and to be brainwashed."
24561,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,MRPHIL,4.5,3.0,"Watched his course ""Justice"" on iTunesU-- a marvelous teacher with an unimposing way of teaching and a unique ability as a facilitator."
24562,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,JUST1001,5.0,3.0,what more to say about this guy. Take and Learn.
24563,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,JUSTI001,5.0,3.0,Been watching through all the lectures for Justice available online on Academic Earth and iTunes University. Michael Sandel's lectures are fascinating and the way he facilitates class discussion should be studied in teaching school. Thank you to Harvard for sharing this class online!
24564,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,JUSTICE,4.5,3.0,Great lectures one of the best that I have had so far he is a master.
24565,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,GLOBALIZATION,5.0,2.0,Sandel was great vs. Summers and Friedman. I look forward to taking Justice this fall.
24566,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,JUSTICE,4.5,1.0,"Sandel is just about the only person who could make Philosophy interesting (to me, anyhow).  He teaches (well, taught) a class with 900 students and still managed to incorporate discussion into his lectures--and pulled it off so well!"
24567,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,JUSTICE,5.0,3.0,Brilliant lecturer. His class will change the way you think about the world. He manages to have an ego without being annoying about it. I can't say enough positive things about this guy as a teacher.
24568,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,MR22,5.0,3.0,"Sandel is a living genius. You cannot be taught by Bentham, Sartre, Russell or Rawls - but Mr. Sandel distils their &lt;i&gt;telos&lt;/i&gt;. The man blows my mind. Take his class before he becomes too important and stops offering it!"
24569,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,MR22,4.5,2.0,Great teacher.  Manages Socratic method with a class of hundreds.
24571,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,MR22,5.0,1.0,"One of the best profs I've had!  Lectures are inspiring and make you question your own deepest convictions, and how you justify them."
24572,190494,Michael,Sandel,Harvard University,Political Science,MR22,5.0,4.0,"Brilliant lecturer!  Amazing command of the material, and wonderful way of letting you follow the arguments for yourself.  He's chosen the right texts and readings for this course.  Too bad section leaders can't all have his style."
24573,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,ISLAM1550,1.0,3.0,"Dry. Not encouraging professor, sadly. Wished it would have been a more balanced class and hit actual contemporary issues rather than just one sided opinions."
24574,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,RELIE1555,3.0,3.0,"A gentle-man in the literal sense of the word. His speech is a little slow, and as I took the course online, I watched it at 1.5 speed, but otherwise very knowledgeable without a hint of personal conceit, which is something I really respect in a teacher."
24575,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,RELIE1555,5.0,1.0,He is an amazing speaker with profound knowledge and articulation about Islam and other beliefs.
24576,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,CB19,5.0,3.0,AMAZING GUY AND PROFESSOR
24577,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,DSG123,3.0,3.0,"Super nice guy,test were ridiculous but enjoyed the class.Also he really loves pickles.A jar of pickles will give you 5 extra points on the test."
24578,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,ISLAM1550,5.0,3.0,Dr. Asani provided wonderfully clear 2 hour lectures for my Islam course.  I learned a great deal about expressions of the Islamic relgion and feel like we only scratched the surface.  I would take him and his course again in a heartbeat.  I would add that Dr. Diane Moore assisted in the online discussions and offered significant insight.
24579,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,DESG123,4.0,3.0,Very motivating
24581,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,CPOI,5.0,1.0,"One of the kindest man I have met, especially for someone of his academic stature.  He was generous both of his time and knowledge and greatly facilitated my learning of the myriad prisms of Islam.  Highly recommended."
24583,76603,Ali,Asani,Harvard University,Design,2006,3.0,4.0,"KInda boring, i don't know why everyone keeps sayin that the prof. was hot?"

24614,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,1.0,3.0,"The good: Dr. Carr is a good, engaging lecturer. Bad: Dr. Carr's communication skills fall apart in writing. Her lecture slides and assignments are riddled with errors or unclear language. I told Dr. Carr that what she marked as incorrect on my test is in fact in the lecture slides, and she refused to budge. This has happened several times- absurd."
24615,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,4.0,4.0,Dr. Carr can be a teensy brash at times but you can tell she really wanted people to learn the material and find it interesting; she genuinely tried to incorporate feedback. She did race through some lectures but only because so much material to cover. Hard class but learned SO much and get a notecard for exams. Textbooks helpful but not necessary.
24616,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS65,5.0,1.0,Best Professor i've ever had!!
24617,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS65,1.0,4.0,bad
24618,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,1.0,3.0,Her powerpoints are full of grammatical and spelling errors. Also you will need to go to lecture because her powerpoints list terms to know but she only verbally explains what you need to know. She also talks to much about her kids and family...
24619,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS456,3.0,1.0,"Laziest professor ever, easy to get a good grade"
24620,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS65,3.0,5.0,Shes horrible
24621,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS65,2.0,4.0,Despite getting an A in this class the tests were quite difficult. The material itself inst difficult but Prof. Carr's lectures are horrendous. There is no introduction to  any of the material and the important slides are often rushed. Go to class having pre-read the lectures and textbook. She flies through material. Poor communication.
24622,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,E65D,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Carr is great! Her course is very well structured and the material is clear with her power point study guides. I usually *hate* watching lecture videos, but I have really enjoyed watching her lectures from home. Other people complain about her  personal anecdotes, but I have found them useful in remembering the class material."
24623,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,COS126,1.0,5.0,Professor Carr's lectures are extremely long. Her tests are based off what she says in lecture and what is on the PowerPoint slides. The PowerPoints can be anywhere from 50-100+ slides. She has not given any study guides for tests. Many of the open response questions on tests were not about topics discussed in class.
24624,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,2.0,3.0,The class itself was easy. You get a notecard on tests and the material is not very challenging. The final was a bit of a curveball though. She is a very lazy teacher though. Each in-class assignment took up 10-20 minutes and could have been completed in less time. She's also unwilling to admit when she might be wrong about a grade or was unclear.
24625,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,1.0,4.0,Professor Carr is condescending in her interactions with students. She seems annoyed when you ask a questions or to be more specific.  Lecture is basically her reading the slides  aloud and telling personal stories. Not very approachable or helpful (when approached). Her exams are extremely long. You would be better off taking the class elsewhere.
24626,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,4.0,4.0,I took both semesters of A+P in 2015. It is clear that Dr. Carr had read past course evaluations and actively tries to improve her class based on previous student's feedback. I think that her class is now more fair and engaging than it sounds like it was in the past. No textbook reading is required and it is definitely possible to get a good grade.
24627,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,1.0,3.0,"I felt I could have learned all the material myself, and probably to a better degree while also enjoying it more, by just reading the textbook instead of going to lecture (which are mandatory). Lectures were not helpful, tests sometimes felt like they bad material not taught (i.e. mentioned once in lecture), professor's not very approachable..."
24628,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,1.0,5.0,"This class was a requirement for a nursing program... I would have dropped it if I could. Rambling class lectures, information dumps, massive amounts of readingmemorization, and terrible study guides. Dreading the next semester. :( Typically an A-B+ kind of student, looks like a C for this one."
24629,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,1.0,4.0,"Worst teacher I've had; doesn't seem to know her material very well, rushes through slides then babbles about irrelevant personal issues--like what she was eating when her water broke. Many typos on all slides. Can't answer a question if it's not already on her slides--which she mostly only reads rapidly over. Answer keys on exams full of mistakes."
24630,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE65C,1.0,3.0,"This class has the potential to be so interesting and fun, but the professor is condescending, rude, and frankly whiny. She doesn't even seem to enjoy teaching and her assignments range from extremely fair, to out of left field. Definitely possible to get a good grade, but I don't feel like I learned anything and came out with a headache."
24631,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,E65CHUMANAP,1.0,4.0,"Does not care about fostering learning among her students. Is rude on a personal level, and is unclear with assignment instructions. Worst professor I've ever had."
24632,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,E65C,2.0,5.0,Do not take this course. Exams consist of questions with vague requirements shes outlined in her head. Don't bother asking her to clarify her grading because you can't argue with illogical reasoning. One of the worst teachers I've ever had the misfortune of crossing.
24633,1712398,Jennifer,Carr,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS456,3.0,2.0,"terrible professor. Doesn't care at all about the class. Typos in quizzes and exams. Don't bother signing up, you can get a better education elsewhere."
24635,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT100,2.0,4.0,"His team and he are proud to be ruthless in terms of grading and setting you up for failure. Whenever anyone in the class complain about anything, the answer is simple: ""DROP""!"
24636,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT109,5.0,4.0,Explains the concepts clearly. Tries to run the code with the concepts which is really cool because that helps us connect to the concept to practical application of it. Will respond to questions/concerns within minutes/hours. Provides as much materials as possible. Syllabus is clearly defined before semester start so student can be well prepared.
24637,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,4.0,5.0,Very good learning experience but not an easy A by any means. Take the other one if you want an easier grade
24638,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,5.0,4.0,It took 2 -3 weeks time when the course started. Later on I was able to sync up to his teaching style and understood the concepts clearly. He is very effective in communicating and explaining the concepts really well. His home works are tough but learnt a lot in the process. I would recommend taking his course.
24639,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,5.0,4.0,Dr. Parzen is an amazing professor. He is hilarious and keeps the class engaged. The homework and tests were hard and took a long time to complete but I always learned in the process. He was very responsive to all the questions I asked via email or on the discussion board.
24640,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,4.0,4.0,"I enjoyed his lectures. He does go on some rabbit trails, but it adds some spice. He's engaging. The homework is more complicated that what is presented in class, and you will need a lot of time to study. The exams are hard, but he gives a generous curve. If you thoroughly understand the materials, you will do well. -Extension School Student"
24641,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT109,5.0,3.0,"Professor Parzen keeps his lectures engaging though the use of humor. Despite a large class size, he is responsive to students' concerns."
24642,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,2.0,3.0,The homework and practice problems seem removed from the material presented in lecture. I leave lectures feeling fairly confident that I understand the material. Only to be completely baffled by the homework and see the weakest link to the lecture material. Almost like the homework was presenting new and more complicated material.
24643,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT109,2.0,3.0,"Parzen is a nice guy, but I HATE his lectures. He wonders around and talks without ever taking a pause and without regard to the audience. It is so meandering and takes me hours to decode. He needs an editor and to think about how what he is saying is received by the people listening."
24644,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT109,2.0,4.0,"There is a big discrepancy between the difficulty of the material presented in lecture (easy) and the difficulty of the problem sets (much much harder). In some cases, the lecture material is completely divorced from the homework problems. Difficulty of the problems presented in lecture should generally match the homework."
24645,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,5.0,3.0,"I spent a good part of the summer trying to review stats online and decided to take Prof. Parzen's class instead. It is so good. He is funny, and everything in the class is laid out clearly. For example, I had the hardest time finding a good explanation of covariance, but there it is in a few slides, clear and easy to understand."
24646,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT100,5.0,4.0,"One of the best stats teachers I had. Very knowledgeable, clear and precise in his explanations and application of knowledge, hence very respected but utterly funny. Even big classes (&gt;100 people) are super engaging. Very tough though - make sure to study hard, attend all classes. BUT: nothing unexpected on the exams - tough but very fair."
24647,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,5.0,4.0,the best.. or one of.
24648,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,5.0,3.0,"Professor Parzen is amazing - I've taken Stat before but he really applies it in the real world, whether it's public health, finance or other. Not only is he funny, engaging but he also explains it in a really easy to understand way with lots of examples. Students can extract applicable takeaways for work and real life scenarios."
24649,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STATE104,5.0,4.0,"Excellent response time.  I took the E-version of STAT 104, which is a recording of what the Harvard College undergrads see live.  I had taken statistics before and done well, but this man REALLY taught me statistics.  The material is hard, especially if you're coming back to academia after a while like me.  He grades on  curve."
24650,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,3.0,5.0,"Prof. Parzen is a nice guy, and I like his jokes; however, his tests are difficult (mostly because of the time limit), and the majority of your grade is based off of his three major exams. My suggestion is to make sure you ask questions when you are unclear, review all of the practice exams, and take good notes."
24651,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT100,5.0,3.0,"Excellent communicator.  Provides refreshing explanations and critiques of statistical approaches,  along with suggestions for non-traditional techniques. It made the subject much more understandable than previous stats classes - and all with great humor thrown in."
24652,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT100,5.0,3.0,Good man and well respected! makes sure everyone is satisfied and at ease
24653,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT100,3.5,2.0,Funny and great prof
24654,1944365,Michael,Parzen,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT104,2.5,5.0,"Dude is cool.  Knows material well, but forgets that students don't. Get ready to study on your own, a lot. Some of the exam questions are not explained in classreading. "
24655,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,5.0,1.0,Brilliant world class lecturer.

24659,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,2.0,3.0,I used to climb up onto the balcony during his lectures and fall asleep. Best nap time ever.
24660,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,3.0,1.0,"dry, but clear"
24661,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,2.5,4.0,"So boring, but so practical"
24662,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,SOC10,1.0,3.0,boring lectures wow really boring
24663,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,5.0,1.0,Great! nice to not have to endure communist propaganda for once.
24664,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,5.0,1.0,Feldstein is great! His lectures are balanced and fair-minded. The people who complain about him are whiny Harvard liberals.
24665,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,4.5,2.0,Great course from a distinguished economist.
24666,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,1.5,3.0,Lectures are BORING. Super inaccesible. Infrequent lectures. Real teachers in the class are the teaching fellows who are very good.
24667,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,1.0,1.0,Too conservative!
24668,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,2.0,2.0,"No office hours, lectures are very infrequent and uninteresting. Lectures tend to reflect his personal biases on issues like Social Security, Medicare, the EU and so on, and in general have a Reaganomic tilt."
24670,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,3.0,3.0,So boring and one-sided.
24672,176821,Martin,Feldstein,Harvard University,Economics,EC10,1.5,2.0,"Boring, presents data from 1996, isn't aware of what is going on in section, doesn't have office hours, teaches conservative propaganda."
24675,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,COMPS109,5.0,4.0,"The course this summer was challenging - so much to read! Nevertheless, the lectures were fun and inspirational: I always had many new thoughts after class. Prof. Theoharis knows everything about the books he teaches, it's a wonderful opportunity to ask all kinds of questions about content and context of the books! Definitely recommend the course!"
24676,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,COMPS109,5.0,4.0,"He's an absolute genius and an absolute hero. Honest, funny and incredibly inspiring. Theo, truly brings to life the most difficult texts. Never did I think I would be excited to spend three and a half hours discussing the Divine Comedy. "
24677,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,ENGLIT1A,5.0,5.0,"I took a writing class from him at Berkeley in 1984. He changed my life. More than a professor he is a teacher. Most professors assume you are able to write, but he makes sure that if you were not a writer when you came into his class you were when you left."
24678,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,LITRS109,5.0,3.0,"Probably the best professor I have ever had. Complete genius, a stellar lecturer, very entertaining, very nice, and an amazing interpreter of the texts. I, too, took his “Reality, Desire, and the Epic Form” class this summer, where we read the “Odyssey,” Dante’s “Commedia,” and Joyce’s “Ulysses.” Learned so much! More than recommend this guy."
24679,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,LITR109,5.0,4.0,"I took his Summer Class on Reality, Desire and the Epic form and it was great! I highly recommend this class!"
24680,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,ENG203,5.0,2.0,"He's the best! I would take any class he teaches, because he knows more than any other lit prof, and he's so much fun. He's also very encouraging to students in whatever they want to write about -- it's freeing and creative."
24681,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,ENG300,5.0,5.0,I took the Epic Form with Prof Theo 9 years ago - I will never forget those classes. He is brilliant and inspiriational. Great translator too - check out his trans of Cavafy.
24682,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,ENG113,5.0,3.0,"I 'heart' Prof. Theoharis.  Brilliant, brilliant, and...did I say brilliant?  He's one of the best professors I've ever had at Harvard (I've taken 20+ classes)."
24683,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,ENGL182B,5.0,3.0,Phenomenal teacher!
24684,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,EE,5.0,3.0,"I've had Theoharis twice, for Epic Form and a new course he did last fall on Sacred Violence in the American Novel. Truly a great teacher, adviser, friend and human being. Never turn down an opportunity to take one of his classes, you may discover a passion you had no idea was there."
24685,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,EPIC202,5.0,3.0,"Nimbly follows discussion wherever it may lead.  Genuinely welcomes input and ideas about texts.  Unusual combination of detailed knowledge and visceral accessibility (usually you only get one of the above!) Inspiring, made me want to read &amp; talk more &amp; more and the sea, crimson sometimes like fire . . ."
24686,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,WILDEEPICFORM,5.0,4.0,"Theoharis C. Theoharis is, by far, one of the most incredible teachers I have ever had.  He is engaging, interested, learned, and very willing to meet out of class to talk for hours on any subject.  He has become one of my personal heroes.  At any moments time he may burst out in a Tosca operetta, or give a Shakespearean monologue to perfection."
24687,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,EPICFORM,4.5,2.0,Very arrogant and very informative teaching - great energy in the classroom.  You will learn.
24688,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,EPICNOVEL,5.0,4.0,"Of all the professors I have ever had, Theo is hands down the most interesting and knowledgeable.  His classes were fun and he was always excited to be teaching our class the material he knows best.  Definitely worth taking..."
24689,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,WILDE,5.0,3.0,"Categorically, a most engaging and thorough specimen. Not merely a man, but an absolute mantis of Joyce's Ulysses.  Ask him about Nietzsche.  Theo, will you marry us?"
24690,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,ENGJOYCE,1.0,3.0,He is an absolute bore. He is far to concerned with trying to impress you rather than teach you. Avoid this class.
24691,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,FOREF121,5.0,3.0,The best professor and best class I ever took.  He's also very hot.
24692,365960,Theo,Theoharis,Harvard University,Humanities,COMP121,5.0,1.0,"An amazing lecturer.  For 2.5 hours, he kept my interest and seemed genuinely excited about the material.  Knows many languages, cultural references, and is just plain hot to look at it.  Well worth the time, one of the best classes I have ever taken."
24695,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOVTS1241,5.0,4.0,Prof. Sergi was a great mentor and I had a fantastic summer doing GOVT-1241! I truly enjoyed it because it did a wonderful job in terms of creating a nuanced coalescence of Russia and China's past with its current political economy. I believe that the discussions were well-moderated &amp; I enjoyed the readings. It was well-balanced &amp; interesting.
24696,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOVTS1241,2.0,1.0,"The class features surface level lectures on interesting topics in Russia/China. I found the readings were often convoluted and redundant. Keeping up with the news is a better and cheaper way to become an expert in the subject matter. Otherwise, the class is an easy way to meet prerequisites and get credits for little effort."
24697,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECON1317,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bruno is an excellent Economist. He has extensive knowledge of the global economic markets. In my time, with this class, I believe I have a better understanding of global institutions than I did before I took the class. He is an excellent well of knowledge and has good resources and network that can be of benefit to you if you're willing"
24698,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECON1317,1.0,1.0,not smart enough for me
24699,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOV1241,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sergi as class was great due to his teaching style, the case studies and Prof. Li. They are approachable and willing to give guidance. I really appreciate them."
24700,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECON1317,5.0,4.0,Outstanding professor! Immensely knowledgeable in economics; knows how to transmit that knowledge to his students. Highly recommend!
24701,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECON1317,5.0,4.0,"A great, inspiring, challenging and supporting Professor. You learn a lot and the experience is invaluable!"
24702,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOV1241,5.0,3.0,one of harvard's best professors.
24703,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,E1317,5.0,3.0,An excellent professor of emerging economies
24704,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,MGMTE1317,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sergi is a very kind person.  He is a great professor because he wants his students to work hard and in-turn they do (most of them) work hard because they see how much he cares. I wrote 3 1500 page papers and then had a team paper that was about 5000 words. It sounds like a lot, but it was all worth it and I strongly suggest this course."
24705,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECONS1317,5.0,1.0,"A great Professor of Economics. I learned alot from his class especially how the international market is performing with particular emphasis on China, India etc. We got to interact with various guest speakers which enhanced our understanding in the field of Economics. Also, his knowledge in Economics is amazing."
24706,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECONS1317,5.0,1.0,Mr. Sergi is extremely cooperative and helpful. You can approach him very easily and is always ready to help.
24707,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECON1317,5.0,4.0,"Very competent, open minded, receptive, and extremely knowledgeable professor with NYU &amp; Harvard teaching experience. Prof. Sergi keeps the class engaged with interesting topics, guest speakers, and stimulates class discussion. Amazing experience."
24708,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOVTS1241,5.0,1.0,"The topic of class is very rare, yet up to the point, especially in today's world of economics. Bruno S. Sergi has a deep understanding of the subject. Learning is rather easy, but productive at the same time. He has a good sense of humor and he is very humane to students. You wont regret taking this course with this professor."
24709,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECONS,5.0,2.0,One of the best professor I had in Harvard. Very clear to understand and knowledgable about the material covered. He always invites speaker from the professional field to get involve student on the topic.  At the end of the class you always feel to have learned a lot .
24710,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,ECONS1317,5.0,3.0,Professor Sergi is an excellent lecturer! His technocratic expertise is very impressive! He really cares about his students and is always willing to provide additional support!
24711,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOVTS124,5.0,4.0,best professor I have ever met!
24712,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOVTS124,4.5,1.0,Very clear and concise
24713,1620773,Bruno,Sergi,Harvard University,Political Science,GOV1241,5.0,3.0,He's dynamic and totally into knowledge. Welcomes different perspectives and questions. Lively and humorous lectures. This guy will not try to foist his own brand on you. He seems to lack the common scholar's bias strongly in favor of his own ideas over those of others. He showed great interest in students' understanding and success.
24715,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1726,5.0,4.0,Very current on what's happening and never boring.
24716,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOV1726,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Miner is an excellent professor who manages to cram an incredible amount of material in a semester while making it all interesting and relevant. Be warned though, there is a staggering amount of reading and two of the writing assignments are far more difficult than their page requirement would indicate."
24717,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1733,4.0,3.0,good
24718,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1880,5.0,3.0,Such an inspirational professor
24719,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOV1733,5.0,4.0,"Michael Miner is incredible! He really cares about students and if you ask for help you will get it, even if he has to give up his free time! He really knows the subject matter and is an incredible writing instructor who taught me SO much!"
24720,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1796,5.0,2.0,He is a very helpful and fair minded. Well versed and authoritative on subject matter. Future Professor
24721,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOV1733,5.0,4.0,Does some lecturing but a great writer. Helpful and going places.
24722,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,1796,5.0,2.0,Makes every class worth it...
24723,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1880,5.0,4.0,"A knowledgeable guy, and one of the few TA's I have had who does not see the job as an annoyance, or an intrusion on his other commitments. He is genuinely interested in helping his students learn to write with clarity and accuracy; he is knowledgeable about his field, and generous in sharing his knowledge. A rare pleasure among TAs!"
24724,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1880,5.0,2.0,"Quiet, but smart. Very engaging one on one and knows his stuff."
24725,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1733,4.0,2.0,"Straight forward. Work hard, you will do well."
24726,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1900,4.5,2.0,"Not a full professor yet but seemed much more capable than the senior faculty. Smart but not condescending, hard to find in this place sometimes."
24727,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1733,5.0,1.0,Summer class.
24728,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1733,5.0,2.0,"I did not have a lot of interest in this class but had to take a writing course, so this seemed like a good option. He takes the time to help you become a better writer - you do not get that kind of help in other classes."
24729,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1900,5.0,2.0,This class was not my thing but he helped me get something out of it. Can't ask for much more than that - work with him if you can.
24730,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1733,5.0,2.0,I came into the class an average writer...at best...but I am leaving with much more confidence as my writing has improved dramatically. What more can you ask for?
24731,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT1900,5.0,2.0,Reaaally nice guy and makes you work.
24732,1670330,Michael,Miner,Harvard University,Government,GOVT01,5.0,2.0,Really great fellow - knows his material and helped my writing immensely.
24733,166251,Lawrence,Buell,Harvard University,English,ENG271,1.5,4.0,Not that helpful; not much of a sense of humor; too soft-spoken; obsessed by hair-splitting distinctions which are not that relevant to the larger issues which he he only addresses in a very recondite manner.
24734,166251,Lawrence,Buell,Harvard University,English,ENG91R,5.0,3.0,"Very helpful and kind, and has a good sense of humor. A very charming man."
24735,166251,Lawrence,Buell,Harvard University,English,ENG100,5.0,4.0,This is a person who teaches how to teach as he teaches how to think.  Peerless.
24736,166251,Lawrence,Buell,Harvard University,English,AMLIT,2.0,4.0,Not the nicest.  Makes up a lot of words and has many pets in the class.  I learned a lot about what it means to be humiliated.

24741,166251,Lawrence,Buell,Harvard University,English,LAA64,5.0,3.0,Class was interesting for both non-concentrators and lit-types.  Extraordinarily accessible.  Cares deeply about what he's teaching and those to whom he's teaching it.
24742,166251,Lawrence,Buell,Harvard University,English,LAA64,5.0,2.0,Made the subject clear and fascinating for students outside the department.  Changed my whole view literature and nature.

His students are criticized in a constructive way--his goal is to help you become a better writer.

24848,187527,Howard,Georgi,Harvard University,Physics,PHYSICS16,4.5,4.0,Coolest guy in the world.  The class is so tough that you'll have to work with everyone else to turn in problem sets; it's the best way to get to know the upper-level physics people AND the faculty of the department AND eat AMAZING PHYSICS FOOD at once!

Top 5 professors of all time."
24855,567550,Jens,Meierhenrich,Harvard University,Government,GOV1029,1.0,3.0,"Arrogant and so up himself it is funny. His pretence of knowledge about Africa is embarrassing - he clearly knows very little, yet in his typical arrogance thinks that this isn't spotted by the whole class. I do not understand why Harvard keeps him on."

24866,627493,Gregory,Mankiw,Harvard University,Economics,ECON101,1.0,5.0,Worst teacher. Doesn't explain it and thinks he's so cool because he wrote a book

He is thoughtful in how he structures his lectures and his assignments. Stat 110 is a very challenging class, but he makes it accessible to anyone who is willing to put in the time. He is also incredibly funny, and an all-around good person."
24879,1073084,Joseph,Blitzstein,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT110,5.0,3.0,A real gem!
24880,1073084,Joseph,Blitzstein,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT110,5.0,3.0,I took probability at another college using his textbook; found his lectures online. He. Is. A. Gem. He's so clear. He makes everything seem accessible and makes probability really fun. I'm SO glad that I found his lectures in time because the professor at my school was a nightmare. I hope he sees this and it makes him smile b/c he deserves it!
24881,1073084,Joseph,Blitzstein,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT110,5.0,4.0,He is a cool professor and does a really cool job at teaching Stat 110
24882,1073084,Joseph,Blitzstein,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT110,5.0,3.0,An excellent mix of the theoretical and the practical.  Agreat couse for building math intuition.
24883,1073084,Joseph,Blitzstein,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT110,5.0,4.0,"Joe ""THE BLITZ"" Blitzstein is one of the best lecturers I have ever had.  He takes complicated statistics that are foreign to students and breaks them down so everyone can understand.  He also enjoys solving puzzles and passes on that enthusiasm to his students.  Memorization is unlikely to get you a good grade in this class.  Go to section."
24884,1073084,Joseph,Blitzstein,Harvard University,Statistics,STAT110,4.0,3.0,I followed his Stat 110 class on iTunes. He really helped me understand the concepts. His explanation is clear and examples are very useful.

24893,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME2AB,5.0,4.0,He's amazing! If you put your all into his classes you will be rewarded.  Yes it will be the hardest class of your life but you will not regret a single moment- be sure to take advantage of office hours and ask questions!
24894,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,PHYSICSE1B,1.0,5.0,worst professor ever. He does try to be engaging but it became painfully clear by the end of second semester how lazy he was. Both semester he gave absurd finals. one person actually had a panic attack and had to go to the hospital. The final second semester was no better and he didn't bother to upload our exam grades and ignored our emails
24895,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,PHYSE1A,5.0,4.0,This class proves once again that physics is easily learned if you have a good teacher - one who can clearly explain the concepts and understand where students' confusion comes from - and alleviate it with further clarification. Thank you for an awesome experience!! (and he has a great sense of humor too :)
24896,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME2B,5.0,4.0,He is simply mind blowing. Though attendance are not mandatory but you wouldn't like to miss one of his classes.
24897,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME2B,5.0,4.0,He is a very funny and excellent  lecturer.
24898,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHME2,3.0,5.0,"Logan is a very good teacher but he has one major failing- his ""practice exams"" are not representative of the actual exams. You can take his practice exams and do extremely well, but this will give you a false sense of security."

24901,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME2B,5.0,5.0,"Bloody difficult class, as expected. Fun, manageable, entertaining, stimulating too, which I never expected."
24902,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME2A,5.0,3.0,"Not sure why others have been so negative-- classes at harvard are hard, what do you expect? Logan's lectures have been extremely clear and informative, well-organized, and even fun! His class has made me love organic chemistry--who would have thought that could happen? Great job, excellent teaching. Thanks!"
24903,1169470,Logan,McCarty,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME2A,3.0,5.0,"Extremely difficult classs made more difficult by the fact that the professor's ""practice exams"" are nowhere near the level of difficulty of the actual exams. This creates a false sense of preparedness."
24905,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,5.0,4.0,"As a curriculum developer and foreign language teacher, I was very impressed with how seamless the learning experiance was. Especially  the way the assignments and reading taught APA and scientific writing. It was very well designed, and effective. Professor Weissmark interacts with everyone, which is great, and the TAs were outstanding."
24906,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Weissmark is a heroine in my view.  She is the perfect representation of one who can reconcile people from different walks of life whose ancestor were either victim of unjust treatment or whose ancestor induced violence.   Unequivocally, Dr. Weissmark is an excellent professor. With that said, I encourage serious students to take her course. Keep in mind; you will find her to be highly informative but yet challenging. Hence,  I know that you will leave her course with a vast knowledge of ""Psychology of Diversity."""
24907,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Weissmark responds to emails promptly.  She takes the initiative to reach out to her students to learn about their concerns. For instance, she took the time out of her busy schedule to email me on a few occasions with regards to voicing my concerns. On another occasion, she took the time to return my phone call to aid my concerns. In truth, she must go down in history as the most concerned professor at Harvard University."
24908,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Mona Weissmark is the best professor that I have ever had at Harvard University. Her teaching is precise and concise. I profoundly enjoyed her methodical teaching style. In every class session, she always conveys a PowerPoint presentation. Her teachings are amazingly insightful.  As a matter of fact, I enjoy her teachings so much that I purchased two of her amazing books. One is entitled ""Legacies of the Holocaust and World War II: Justice Matters"".  In all sincerity, that is the best book that I have ever read in my entire life. The other book is entitled ""Doing Psychotherapy Effectively"".  She is so passionate about teaching "" Diversity of Psychology"", that she always post scholarly sources on her tweeter page. Hence, I know that she is sincerely passionate about teaching."
24909,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC1507,5.0,3.0,"This is a life-changing course with excellent content. I feel better prepared in social science research, but also in being a better person."
24910,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE1507,5.0,4.0,"I took Psychology of Diversity with Professor Weissmark at Harvard Summer School in 2013. She is a kind hearted and loving professor who knows her materials very well. A quick google search tells you that she is highly accomplished in her field. Just make sure you do the readings, review lecture notes, and peer review your midterm and final paper."
24911,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE1507,5.0,1.0,"Professor Weissmark is professional in her teaching and shares her knowledge selflessly. Her lectures were intellectual and enlightening as well as fun. The pacing of her lectures were properly scheduled to kept my interest in the topics. She is also inspiring, humorous and witty in her lectures. It is an amazing journey for the course PSYC-E 1507."
24912,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,4.5,1.0,"Very easy class. Her lectures are alright. Whats really amazing is her ability to facilitate a discussion. She asks some very thought provoking questions and really stimulates a conversation. The midterm and final paper were interesting research for us, although it took a bit of time. No textbook, required reading, or exams."
24913,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,4.0,2.0,"In this globalised world of ours, an understanding of diversity - how we instinctively view and feel about others who are different from us, and vice versa - is essential. Prof Weissmark brings light to the subject matter from various angles. Participants go away with a better understanding of themselves and those around them."
24914,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,5.0,2.0,Professor Weissmark is a great professor who is invested in creating learning friendly environment open to discussion and exploration. She is a fair grader and excellent lecturer as well. I would recommend everyone interested in gaining practical insight into psychological diversity to take her class -it was a blast.
24915,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,5.0,4.0,"After taking Prof. Weissmark's class, I found I had a foundational knowledge that propelled my interest in diversity and mulitculturalism into grad school. I am now pursuing the subject matter in my professional life. This class helped start me on this path."
24916,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYS1507,3.5,4.0,Prof Weissmark has opened my eyes to see the world in a whole new perspective. She is inspiring with her openness! Her class is super interesting and we always ran out of time! There's just so much to talk about!
24917,1800030,Mona,Weissmark,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCS1507,5.0,3.0,"Professor Weissmark is extremely clear in her teachings, and brings the theme and message of the class across very well. This is a life-changing course for many of its alumni and it offers a fresh pair of lenses to view the world with. I highly recommend this course."
24918,22094,Kyle,Bates,Harvard University,Engineering,ENG102,4.0,2.0,"Smart, Helpful, and very caring. I highly recommend this professor! I got an A+, just read book and final will take you about 25 minutes max.."

24921,22094,Kyle,Bates,Harvard University,Engineering,ENG,1.0,5.0,"This dude should focus less on his looks and more on his lessons. He is so boring and he says nothing remotely intriguing or thought-provoking. Harvard professors suck, i expected this from BC but not Harvard. My advice is go to Stanford, that's what i'm doing."
24924,22094,Kyle,Bates,Harvard University,Engineering,ENG101,1.0,5.0,Doesn't exist. It's all bs.

24929,22094,Kyle,Bates,Harvard University,Engineering,ENG351,4.5,5.0,"Sexiest man alive, and probably smartest too."
24930,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,NEH2007,2.0,4.0,"Prof.  Vendler does basic explications de texte and mandates! her own speculative, untested, narcissistic style. An Irish nationalist zealot , her approach often  strips the text of the joy of language, poetry, spiritual food, and loses poetrys wild and lively unpredictability. Yet she is  nice + one learns a lot about early 21st century approach."
24931,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,NEH2007,4.5,4.0,"The last day of class, she told us, ""You are my perpetual advisees. If I can help you, write to me."" That's a perfect Vendler moment: she is genuine, generous, and much warmer than you'd expect someone of her caliber to be. She is also intractable and convinced that her readings are always right. Who can blame her, when so often they are?"
24932,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,PTRYLYR,5.0,4.0,absolutely brilliant! The one professor who influenced me the most.
24933,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,POETRYPOETS,4.0,1.0,Her subject is important to her.  He comments are insightful.  She makes the arcane and difficult clear.  Seems to favor women and Irish poets.
24934,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,ENGLISH,2.5,3.0,"Shes alright, really engaging...However i misquoted a Aristotle quote, she laughed in my face and the class and exclaimed. ""how did you, get into Harvard?"" I was sooo angry."
24935,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,ANY,4.5,5.0,Brilliant. Highly recommended.
24936,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,POETRY,5.0,3.0,She's pretty good.
24938,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,YEATS,5.0,4.0,"Extraordinary, brilliant, the quintessence of excellent scholarship in both teaching and research- she is clearly Harvard's crown jewel and the greatest figure in literary studies today!"
24939,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,ENGPOETRY,5.0,4.0,"wonderful, amazing, thrilling. this is what Harvard English was supposed to be"
24940,219327,Helen,Vendler,Harvard University,English,POETRY,5.0,5.0,The most brilliant scholar on the planet!! Dr. Vendler is an inspiringly scintillating instructor whose depth of analytical perceptivity boggles even the most precipient minds.
24942,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1011,4.0,3.0,"I agree with other student fellows. Ed is one of those guys that you either like or don't - nothing in between. He is arrogant, but knows what he is talking about. He knows the subject really well, so he has the right to be like this. If you don't like him, then don't take the class - there are plenty of other options available for you."
24943,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1011,4.0,4.0,People either love him or hate him. I loved him.
24944,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,ECON1011,4.0,5.0,"Inspiring, way sarcastic (loved it), completely brilliant &amp; HIGHLY demanding but my all-time favorite professor at Harvard.  Really cool guy to hang out with, too.  Go to his Ec1011a lunches and take him to your faculty dinner!"
24945,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,EC1011,1.0,4.0,"Arrogant, rude, condescending towards students"
24946,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,2010A,1.0,5.0,"extremely mean, scary, and not helpful at all; he doesnt care about students and he admits it! highly intellingent, totally insane, and quite funny on the other hand; i give him 1/5 in teaching (why dont you permit for 0s?) and 5/5 in everything else."
24947,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,EC2010A,1.5,3.0,the worst notes i ever saw.  makes harvard look a****ty place to do micro theory.
24948,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,EC1011A,1.0,4.0,"Disorganized, rude, and condescending.  His CUE ratings last year were only good because no one who disliked him was still going to class when the forms were handed out."
24950,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,EC1011A,5.0,3.0,Challenging and extremely inspiring. My favorite professor at college so far.
24952,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,EC1011A,3.5,3.0,The man's just like the Devil. That's what makes him so cool.
24953,221893,Ed,Glaeser,Harvard University,Economics,EC1011A,2.0,5.0,"impression from lecture: so scary and genius and hard. real life: real nice guy, quirky, really dorky, soda addict. don't think he doesn't have the time of day for you, he's not that scary at all."
24955,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC1870,5.0,2.0,Super funny
24956,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC1870,5.0,4.0,"A fantastic professor with a passion for psychology that is infectious, Dr. Fersch is one of those rare professors which it is a positive treat to study under. His lectures are very funny and impossible to sleep through, and I would take a course where he simply read the phone book. He's that good."
24957,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC1870,5.0,4.0,"fun, witty, straightforward, tough tests though"
24958,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,LSTUE145,3.5,2.0,"Dr. Fersch is a brilliant man &amp; his classes are interesting - the things I've learned have truly stayed with me.  He is looking for you to prove that you comprehend the material, can back it up with specific examples from the assigned readings/lectures, and that you have opinions. He is more focused on teaching than grading - as it should be. A+"
24959,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC1870,3.0,4.0,"He was a really great professor and what he taught was very interesting, but useless when asking him about the grade I received. He would shoo you away and literally would cover his ears to avoid any questions about how he marks the work. Great lectures, very interesting topic, very enthusiastic - not helpful when it comes to asking about grades."
24960,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,CLASSSECT,5.0,2.0,My favorite Prof at Harvard!
24961,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,LSTU110,3.5,1.0,"While it seemed like his information was clear, and I took masterful notes, his grading, particularly on the final, was unhelpful.  He declined response when I tried to contact him and find out what went wrong.  While the content was good, don't count on having the grade make sense in the end.  His tests come largely from lecture."
24962,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,LAWANDPSYCH,4.5,2.0,"Spring 03... Enjoyed it so much that I took his Law n Ethics class the following semester.  I recommend you take his class because this guy is hilarious!  There are not many professors that can keep me wide awake during class.  This guy does that and then some.  Easiness: 4 because the amount of time i spent studying, I expected to a higher return.  Helpfulness:  4 because he isnt available for office hrs unless you count the 5 min he's available before class."
24963,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,LAWANDPSYCH,5.0,1.0,he is the best
24964,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,LAWANDETHICS,5.0,1.0,"He is THE king of teachers! Truly, the best and most interesting teacher at Harvard.  Zanny like a genius! Fun, informative, and brilliant!"

24966,334471,Ellsworth,Fersch,Harvard University,Psychology,LSTUE110,4.5,2.0,"Professor Fescher is a brilliant man with lots of interest ideas.  He made you laugh in every class.  He is the most direct professors I had at Harvard.  There is a lot of reading but the exam are basic on the reading, the video, and his lecture."
24967,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,CLASE116,1.0,3.0,"Unless you are a fan of the ""Read what I wrote, write what I think"" stereotype, avoid this one like the plague. Assignments will be really dull and telegraphed. Ancient greek heroes was one of the worst classes I took at harvard if not the worst. If you like convoluted assignments and massaging egos for a pat in the back, this might be your guy"
24968,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,EDX,4.5,5.0,"It was my great privilege to take Prof Nagy's ""The Ancient Greek Hero"" online. He is brilliant and erudite, and has a deep love of the Classics that is well-communicated to students. This is a shining example of how powerful online education can be! And if you have the opportunity to take a RL class with him, grab it."
24969,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,CB221X,4.0,4.0,"Prof Nagy is a brilliant professor with a real love of enthusiasm for Classics. I've learned so much from his class, and it's made me passionate about learning more."
24970,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,CLASE116,5.0,3.0,Highly recommend. Seems born to do what he does. Can't imagine finding anyone better. Very well designed &amp; managed online program; great reading lists/materials; infectious enthusiasm; great lectures. Just awesome to have someone (and TA too) of this caliber to guide one through the Classics.
24971,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,CB22X,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher, sweet personality, demanding course. I loved the Classics even more."
24972,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,HERO0,5.0,2.0,"Brilliant. Not the most polished speaker, but ridiculously enthusiastic about and encouraging toward young scholars. Be careful, though -- you might end up falling in love with the Classics."
24973,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,CLAS116,5.0,3.0,"Heroes and more - Had Professor Nagy for 3 courses, wouldn't have missed them for the world. Besides being 1 of the best scholars ever, he's a Mensch. He treats students like adults (no taking attendance - up to US to keep up), &amp; doesn't teach in a subject-vacuum, bringing in other histories and lit, bridging themes. Remembers us after course done."
24974,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,HEROES,5.0,3.0,"A Harvard luminary. In a world of Professors, of TFs, at last a real Teacher."
24976,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,HOMER,4.5,3.0,"I had Nagy for a class in Homeric Greek over 20 years ago. He was not the most organized person, but he was (and is) so effin' brilliant that serious students will be awestruck."
24977,377596,Gregory,Nagy,Harvard University,Classics,HERO,5.0,4.0,"The best.  Ouch: his ""concepts of the hero"" class can make a classics enthusiast out of anyone."
24980,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHE1240,5.0,4.0,"Professor Carson is amazing at what she does. I keep thinking of her lectures months after I've taken the course. She's incredibly knowledgeable, though she's tough (though not insanely so) and gives a lot of work. However, the reading is very applicable and the assignments useful for prepping for final exams and papers."
24981,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE1018,4.0,2.0,"Shelley Carson was an absolutely wonderful instructor. She was very clear in her teaching and very soothing to listen to - not in the way that you fall asleep, but that her voice is calming. At the end of lecture I often found myself saying ""What? Class is over already?"" In addition, Shelley is also very compassionate about her students."
24982,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHE1240,4.0,2.0,Excellent choices of the topics to include in class. The course contents were very coherent and I learned a lot of useful ideas and knowledge that apply to my life. Best course I ever took (out of 4 years of undergraduate and 4 years of graduate school).
24983,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCH1240,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Carson's Abnormal Psych class was an amazing opportunity for someone (like myself) obsessed with brain disorders, mood disorders...etc..the class will be easy for those with a prior understanding of the material.  Copy all notes.  Stay organized. Print out ALL lecture notes for final exam.  Know all of your stuff! The case studies can be tough."
24984,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1240,5.0,2.0,"Abnormal Psych was super interesting. She was very engaging and I loved the class. Excellent, highly recommended"
24985,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCH1240,4.0,1.0,"Very nice person. Very structured. If you study the lecture notes, you don't need to read the book == she covers it all in lecture. Recommeded."
24986,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSCHE1240,4.0,3.0,"Enjoyed the class, interesting material. She was accessable, knowledgable and fair. Liked her TF's also. Study for the tests (short answer and case study evals, she tells you about format in advance) and write decent thoughtful papers and you'll do well. Shows genuine consideration for her students."
24988,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCH1241,4.5,3.0,Shelley is a great teacher. Very informative and open to students. Her lectures were interesting and her comments informative. I highly recommend her.
24989,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCH18,5.0,4.0,Really really nice lady who 'mothers' her students and genuinely cares about them as people. Teaches the material with a lot of compassion.
24990,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,1240,2.0,1.0,very nice but clueless. panders to students.
24991,540333,Shelley,Carson,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHE1240,2.5,3.0,"the information was interesting, but Shelley's lectures are nothing more than a powerpoint slideshow of the DSM and vaguely related video segments.  Too much emphasis on ""those people"" suffering from ""that disease."""

25019,1154223,Oliver,Knill,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH21A,1.0,3.0,I agree with the previous review. Oliver is bad. Very bad.
25020,1154223,Oliver,Knill,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH21A,1.0,3.0,"A truly horrible teacher. For some reason he thinks he's a funny human being, but that really couldn't be further from the truth. He spends all his time making pathetic youtube videos that are extremely cringy. Instead, he should spend all that excess time improving his teaching. I and my fellow students can't follow anything he says."
25021,1154223,Oliver,Knill,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATHS21A,5.0,3.0,A pretty awesome dude in general! Once I won some chocolate bars in his class after we had a competition to see who could answer the most geometry trivia questions. He really cares about math and his lectures are great! Make sure you do the practice tests.

Small anecdote but goes to show what a caring, principled professor Oliver is. Math 21a and b are challenging, well-taught, remarkably organized and you always feel you can turn to Oliver for help!!"
25023,1154223,Oliver,Knill,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH21A,4.5,2.0,"Amazing and hilarious professor. I took Multivariable Calculus, and Professor Knill managed to make 3 hour lectures fun and engaging without going on long tangents or abandoning problems. He works thoroughly works every problem and encourages class participation with jokes and contests. Very helpful during office hours."
25024,1154223,Oliver,Knill,Harvard University,Mathematics,S21A,4.5,5.0,Oliver Knill was a hilarious and extremely interesting professor. He got to know every student in the class of 100 by name.

He holds that getting to know his students as people is very important, so at the beginning of his course, he will schedule a short 5-10 minute chat with each student. His class involves projects and homework assignments, and he does recognize faces/take class participation into account."

He does not explain how the theory applies to anything. He does not offer assistance. His TA or whoever the young person is in his course seemed far more fit at teaching than himself.

He doesn't cover a lot of topics because he feels ""that this should have been covered in prior classes"", yet he will give you HW based on those topics.

25145,344288,Steven,Levitsky,Harvard University,Political Science,POL262,5.0,3.0,"I took Prof. Levitsky while he was teaching at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. Really he is very knowledge about world´s politics and Latin America´s politics. It was a pleasure to have him teaching abroad, and REALLY, HE MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN PERUVIAN POLITICS DURING ELECTIONS. I really recommend him for any class he would teach."
25146,344288,Steven,Levitsky,Harvard University,Political Science,GOV1295,5.0,5.0,fantastic!
25147,344288,Steven,Levitsky,Harvard University,Political Science,GOV20,4.5,2.0,"Levitsky is an enthusiastic, dedicated professor that can compel anyone to find the subject matter appealing.He presents thorough lectures that are compelling and interesting. Be prepared for tons of reading and a heavy load of memorization. The workload is worth it."
25148,344288,Steven,Levitsky,Harvard University,Political Science,GOV20,2.5,3.0,"Seems a bit pompous, although he has no reason to be. Jealous when speaking about colleagues. Lectures are useless if you do the readings, no need to go. Real learning happens in section with your TF."
25149,344288,Steven,Levitsky,Harvard University,Political Science,GOV1295,5.0,3.0,A fantastic professor; passionate about Latin America and passionate about teaching.

25157,344862,Noam,Elkies,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH55,5.0,5.0,amazingly good
25158,344862,Noam,Elkies,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH55,2.0,5.0,Prof Elkies is a genius who has a great sense of humor. Take his Math 55 class if you dare!!!!!!!
25159,344862,Noam,Elkies,Harvard University,Mathematics,MAT556,1.0,1.0,Easiest class ever.
25160,344862,Noam,Elkies,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH55,3.0,4.0,"Elkies knows his stuff, but he does nothing to manage the competitive show-offs who dominate the class.  The fastest students may not be the deepest, and I wish he had shut some of these guys up to let others have a chance to participate.   I wish he had given solution sets to homework assignments, and had been more careful posing novel questions."
25163,344862,Noam,Elkies,Harvard University,Mathematics,MATH213A,3.5,5.0,"Depending on which class you take, his problem sets can be extremely difficult.

25165,346419,Emmanuel,Akyeampong,Harvard University,History,HISTHIST,5.0,1.0,Most intellectually sound educator I have ever had the privilege of taking!!! quite possibly one of the greatest teachers at Harvard...he certainly knows how to provide one with an education in a productive manner without being a complete STIFF!!
25166,346419,Emmanuel,Akyeampong,Harvard University,History,HISTB25,5.0,1.0,great
25167,346419,Emmanuel,Akyeampong,Harvard University,History,HISTORY,4.5,4.0,Hmmmnever knew a better teacher... :)

25174,346419,Emmanuel,Akyeampong,Harvard University,History,HIST,5.0,3.0,"A very, very good lecturer."
25176,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,HIST110,3.0,3.0,"Professor Lowry is very kind, but her lectures are boring. The workload is minimal throughout the semester, but there is very little guidance towards the midterm. She did give us much more help on the final. Do the extra credit!"
25177,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,HIST110,1.0,4.0,One of the worst classes I have taken at UNC. Professors lectures are very dry and she seems very uninterested and not passionate about the material. Honestly a hard class to do well in and dont feel like I got much from it.
25178,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,HIST110,1.0,4.0,My issue with her was for exams she doesn't allow study guides that are shared throughout the class. She actually turned the person that started the class-wide midterm study guide over to the honor court. She makes a relatively simple subject harder than it should be. Don't take this class.
25179,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,AMST231,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Lowery (at UNC not Harvard) was pretty great overall! She's super smart and really charismatic, which is extremely helpful in the HIST department. My only gripe is that the class was half taught by the students, not Prof. Lowery who knew WAY more stuff. I just wasn't a fan. But a good class overall."
25180,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,HIST110,2.0,1.0,"One of the easiest classes I've taken at UNC. I never went to class and got a 98 in the class. She gives a TON of extra credit, and the TAs grade essays/finals/midterms really easily. She's a boring lecturer so don't take this if you want to be engaged. But, I think it's the easiest US Diversity credit course at UNC."
25181,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,HIST110,5.0,1.0,"Now at UNC, not Harvard. Easiest class I have ever taken. She doesn't lecture, she mostly just puts on videos or podcasts and sits back. You could never go to class and just read the book and be 100% fine. Her midterm and final were jokes and were easy A's. The essays determine your grade but they're easy too. Easy A. Must take."
25182,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,HIST110,4.0,1.0,Nothing to say but TAKE ANYTHING WITH HER. Easiest class I've ever taken at UNC. Tons of extra credit and exams are a joke. Lots of movies in class and attendance didn't really effect your grade. TA's are super helpful and really let you do whatever you want. MUST TAKE FOR US DIVERSITY CREDIT!
25183,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,110,5.0,1.0,This class is super easy -- she gives you  so many extra credit opportunities and basically hands you the exams in advance. She teaches masterfully and you'll find yourself learning so much without too much effort You are really well prepared for all test materials. She's also really chill and has interesting lectures. Take it- you won't regret it!
25184,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,HIST110,4.5,1.0,"One of the best and outgoing professors you'll ever have at Carolina. She's funny, doesn't provide too much work, and willing to help."
25185,848439,Malinda,Lowery,Harvard University,History,THEEAST,4.0,3.0,Loved it!
25187,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE15,4.0,2.0,Fantastic lectures. Not very many assignments so you can't afford to miss any of them. The assignments also could reflect the material and exams more.
25188,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHO101,5.0,3.0,"Clear, funny, engaging. Good at providing intro level material that doens't feel dumbed down."
25189,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGY101,5.0,3.0,Pay attention and you'll do great. Get ready to learn a ton. Tests are accompanied by a well-written study guide that will completely prepare you for exams.
25190,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHO101,4.5,2.0,"Super wonderful guy. Humble, engaging, sincere. Really cares about the students and teaching. Clear. Basic class. Not too difficult. Does require time input to do the labs and study for exams."
25191,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE15,4.0,2.0,Todd was very clear on what material was important for exams-spelled out verbally and highlighted in his lectures. Material and exams were easy. Lectures were moderately interesting but you can tell Todd is passionate about psychology. His lectures are focused around history and scientific literature. Good introduction to psychology. Go to class.
25192,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE15,3.0,2.0,"He's not really the most accessible teacher. He basically never emails you back if you don't go through the TA first.   That said, his course material is so easy, the reading is pretty much optional, and the weekly homework is a joke. He talks about his kids a lot (in a good way, like little psychological projects).  Also he's really attractive."
25193,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGY101,3.0,3.0,Hides behind computer screen and occasionally reads of a manuscript.  Mixes astronomical terms with very basic terminology in a roller-coaster ride. Barely interacts with  students. I should have saved my dollars.
25194,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHO101,5.0,1.0,Professor Todd was great to learn from.
25195,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC23D,4.5,4.0,.
25196,1011861,Todd,Farchione,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC23D,5.0,2.0,"Harvard Summer School, Behaviorism and Behavior Modification.  Awesome professor.  (And highly attractive.)  Do not miss."
25198,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE1611,5.0,4.0,Dr. Fatemi is truly a great professor! His lectures are awesome! You can't be in his class and not listen! He gets you really into the topic and gives you a great depth of topics and applications. Wonderful hours! Unforgettable and really impressive!!
25199,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE1611,5.0,1.0,I left this class a better woman than I was before and understood why Harvard is the best University. The best word to describe him is charismatic. Expect to buy a few books (easy read). He will give an in depth lecture in class that is FAR from boring. You learn more than you originally signed up for. I HIGHLY recommend &amp; wish I took it sooner.
25200,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGY1611,4.5,4.0,Dr. Fatemi is a brilliant professor! I'd love to take more courses with him.  He brings a great wealth of knowledge with plenty of real life examples!   He is awesome!
25201,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,325,2.5,4.0,"This class was strange.  did not follow syllabus, did not give clearly assigned readings, would read from slides, go off on tangents then race through the actual examinable material. seemed like the slides mailed to us after class had extra information added to it that was not lectured on in class and his point notes are fairly hard to understand. "
25202,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,1,5.0,1.0,Only the best man in the world we really appreciate him because of knowledge and speech.
25203,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,1,5.0,1.0,Only the best professor
25204,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,PYCH1008,4.5,3.0,He rocks! He is so good.He helps you experience psychology.I very much enjoyed his discussions and lectures.He is awesome!!
25205,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGY1005,3.5,4.0,He is one of the best professors I have ever met. you get mesmerized when he speaks. Marvelous speaker who gives you deep knowledge! Take his classes!
25206,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1005,3.5,4.0,He is a wonderful professor! Really smart! I enjoyed his lectures and learned a lot.
25207,1728811,Sayyed Mohsen,Fatemi,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY123,2.0,2.0,Delusional in regards to his memory. Thinks he has superior memory but repeatedly quotes the book and other sources incorrectly. Really enjoys barging about his memory!
25209,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSS50,1.0,5.0,Horrible professor who lacks compassion. Super judgmental. He will laugh at your pain. Lectures are long and boring and the work feels like it has nothing to do with the course including the practice test. He sets you up for failure. Horrible communication skills. I don't recommend.
25210,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSS50,5.0,3.0,"awesome professor, very nice person. His class was very interesting and I highly recommend it. Even if you may not be very much into neuroscience he will make you love this subject! I am looking forward to meeting him again and hopefully taking another one of his classes!"
25211,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS50,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Draft is the best professor I have ever had. I love Neuroscience and have read the text book assigned for this course long ago due to interest, and what surprised me is that Prof. Draft has always provided new insights on each and every subject he put into the syllabus of the course. Definitely love this guy."
25212,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS17,1.0,1.0,"Very difficult class. If you are not good at or interested in biology, this class will drive you crazy. Don't sign up for this class. It's not a good choice. You'll have a hard time passing this class. The professor is very mean."
25213,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOS50,1.0,1.0,"I don't recommend his class because he is very strict. If you submit your homework one second late, you will get 0 points. He doesn't think about whether you have a job or anything. You just get a zero. No extra credit. If you don't want your GPA to go down, don't take his class."
25214,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSE52,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Draft is THE BEST professor I have ever had in my entire academic career. I took The Neurobiology of Pain with him and absolutely loved it. The material was very tough and some of it obscure since some of the mechanisms are not well understood, but Professor Draft explained it with such clarity and enthusiasm I fell in love with the subject!"
25215,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSS50,5.0,5.0,"I took this class after reading Prof. Draft's reviews here and this turned out to be the best class in my life. The level of attention, respect, support you get is just unmatched. EXTREMELY structured, expectations, resources - all crystal clear. Prof. Draft and TAs available 24/7, no question is stupid, committed, passionate, perfect presenter."
25216,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIO50,5.0,5.0,"The class was intense, but it was so much fun."
25217,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,BIOSS50,5.0,4.0,I took Neurobiology with him for 7 weeks and because of that he obviously had to pack in a lot of information in such a short time. He did go quite quickly in class but he was open to questions during lecture. He's also really helpful during office hours and will never make you feel dumb. He never kept us back after the end of class.
25218,2192391,Ryan,Draft,Harvard University,Biology,MCB148,5.0,3.0,"Absolute savage, major goofball, and truly cares about getting his students to learn. Love this guy."
25219,111064,Michael,Flier,Harvard University,Languages,CULTBLF38,5.0,3.0,"Professor Flier is an incredibly inspiring and interesting person. His lectures are rich and deep. It was not the easiest class because there was a lot of reading, but every minute was really worth it. I learned so much in this class."
25220,111064,Michael,Flier,Harvard University,Languages,UKRNS127,3.0,5.0,Very interesting person
25221,111064,Michael,Flier,Harvard University,Languages,LAC28,3.5,3.0,The course material is interesting but not always clearly presented.  Overall a pretty good course.
25222,111064,Michael,Flier,Harvard University,Languages,SLAVIC,1.0,5.0,"If he does not like you, your grade will not be good. If he does like you, the chances of a good grade are considerably better. Here's a hint for success: if you're going to take his class, be a male."
25223,111064,Michael,Flier,Harvard University,Languages,SLAVIC,1.0,5.0,A discouraging experience
25224,111064,Michael,Flier,Harvard University,Languages,SLAVIC,1.5,4.0,Doesn't grade based on performance.
25225,111064,Michael,Flier,Harvard University,Languages,SLAVIC,1.5,5.0,"If you are female, stay away.  He hates you."

25228,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,RELI1015,4.0,4.0,"Can't add anything that hasn't already be said.  Great prof, but you'll earn your grade here."
25229,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,RELI1015,5.0,3.0,"Comparative Religious Ethics was a reasonably challenging course. Prof. Monius is a good lecturer and is very accessible. She expects you to read, think creatively, and write well. I recommend students take expository writing or a similar ""how to craft an argument"" course before enrolling in CRE -- you'll find this course much more manageable."
25230,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,RELG2001,2.5,4.0,"I found some of the lectures to be biased.  Overall, not really a class that interested me as compared to others."
25231,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,RELCOMP,5.0,5.0,a great professor. I found the class (comparative religious ethics) to be fairly difficult.
25232,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,RELI1015,5.0,4.0,Not an easy class for sure but an amazing teacher with a wealth of knowledge!  If you work hard you will do well...but you must put in the effort.
25233,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,HINDU3405,5.0,4.0,Especially interesting and helpful professor.  Highly recommended!
25234,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,HINDUETHICS,5.0,4.0,"If one wishes to meet with one of the  intellectual giants at Harvard, one should go and take Professor Monius's classes and feel what it means to read the Hindu texts. Here is a person, very kind, knowleageable, and possibly most unbiased, critical, and professionally very highly competent. Enjoyed two of her classes- H. Ethics and Religion 2001."
25235,132922,Anne,Monius,Harvard University,Theology,RELIE1015,3.5,3.0,She is a truly gifted and experienced teacher who gets excited with the subject matter. A real treat for anyone who wants to learn about Hinduism and Buddhism.
25237,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LAT1,3.0,1.0,Easiest class ever. He thinks he's a genius but I outsmarted him many times. I truly had no trouble with this class.
25238,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LATI1,5.0,5.0,"Although he is charming, erudite, and (usually) nice, he is also INSANELY difficult and has extremely high expectations. Even those who know their material inside out will still find Krebs challenging. If you don't have 20-25 hours a week to devote to his class, don't register for it."
25239,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LATIN100,5.0,5.0,"This man is a living genius, and he wants you to be one too.  Blunt, funny, and encouraging, he will not coddle you, but he will teach you a ridiculous amount."
25240,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LAT1,3.0,5.0,"If you don't have photographic memory (and even then, this class will kill you), good luck!"
25241,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LAT1B,4.0,5.0,"The phrase ""extremely difficult"" is really euphemistic. I have never had a more demanding, more challenging professor. His class is not impossible...well, maybe it is for some people. Working your butt off is the LEAST you can do for yourself if you want ANY hope of not miserably failing his class. He teaches well, but his tests are monstrous."
25242,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LAT1B,3.5,5.0,"Professor is very nice, extremely difficult, and willing to help -- tip: do NOT fall behind in his class; you will regret it! You'll learn a lot if you have an interest Latin or Greek, but you'll work for your grade!"
25243,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LATE1,4.0,5.0,"Latin is naturally very difficult, but Prof. Krebs is usually clear in lectures and always open to helping struggling students. That being said, his expectations are high, and this is by far the most difficult course I have taken at Harvard. It will take desire, interest, and a willingness to put in hard work to succeed in his course."
25244,467743,Christopher,Krebs,Harvard University,Classics,LAT1B,4.0,5.0,"Very tough teacher, but it forced me to work harder and I appreciated this in the end. I struggled a bit with comprehension and he helped me every step of the way. He's always QUITE handsome, which never hurts."
25247,487813,Jeremy,Rau,Harvard University,Communication,LING120,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor with unfathomable knowledge and passion in his subject.

25249,487813,Jeremy,Rau,Harvard University,Communication,GREEK134,2.0,4.0,"Talks down to students, does not seem to care about their interests in the least. Does not seem to be much interested in teaching at all."

25251,487813,Jeremy,Rau,Harvard University,Communication,GREEK134,5.0,5.0,Best Professor at Harvard and also best dressed. Also the smartest and funniest person I have ever met.
25252,487813,Jeremy,Rau,Harvard University,Communication,GREEK134,1.5,4.0,He is unfriendly and unable to teach clearly
25257,522176,Gary,Urton,Harvard University,Anthropology,ANTH63,5.0,3.0,"I highly recommend this professor. Course was stimulating. Takes time to provide good feedback on student work, and is generous with his time outside of class."

25259,522176,Gary,Urton,Harvard University,Anthropology,ANTH2050,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Urton is incredibly knowledgeable and patient. My writing and theoretical understanding of anthropology have vastly improved since taking courses with him. When reading papers, he gives thoughtful, helpful criticism that improve the overall argument of the paper. His courses are a fair amount of work, but they are worth it!"
25260,522176,Gary,Urton,Harvard University,Anthropology,ANTHRO1175,5.0,3.0,Leads some of the best discussions I've had at the university and always puts together great syllabi for his courses. I always learn a lot when I take his courses.
25261,522176,Gary,Urton,Harvard University,Anthropology,ANTHINKA,3.0,3.0,"unsubstantiated and illogical hypotheses, very little progress made on ""reading"" the khipu, arrogant, disinterested in teaching  . . . but he will continue to receive grants and keep his lucrative academic position.  "
25262,522176,Gary,Urton,Harvard University,Anthropology,ANTHINKA,4.5,2.0,"Good prof: Sometimes a  little dry in lectures, but extremely helpful if you make an appointment to discuss a project. I've taken 2 classes with him. So far, it's been a good experience."
25265,522176,Gary,Urton,Harvard University,Anthropology,ANTH63,3.0,3.0,"He is an intellegent man but this does not make him a good professor.  He is a dry lecturer that is fairly demanding and at times it is unclear what is going to be on the tests.  However, if you do all the readings you should do well."
25266,719829,Dodge,Fernald,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCH15,5.0,1.0,He is very inspirational.  He himself I think carries part of history of psychology.  He also is very easy to understand and to talk with.  He also is enthusiastic when he answers students' questions and gives very helpful guides.  I think he is very well experienced in teaching as well as enjoys exploring even more than he already knows.
25267,719829,Dodge,Fernald,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCE15,3.0,1.0,Lots of meandering into seemingly irrelevant tangents.

25275,896036,Eric,Rentschler,Harvard University,Film,E182,2.0,4.0,I am diametrically opposed to Prof. Rentschler's interpretation and reasoning of film symbolism and aesthetics. His analysis is pure conjecture and does not seem to correlate with the filmmaker's intent.
25276,896036,Eric,Rentschler,Harvard University,Film,STARE182,2.0,2.0,so much material and so little of it is actually discussed it doesn't add up to a lot of substance. No new ideas nor skills acquired.
25277,896036,Eric,Rentschler,Harvard University,Film,STARE176,3.0,5.0,There's more reading in the class than there are pages in the Bible. This class consumed as much time as 5 community college classes. You need to be 100% committed to even stand a fighting chance in this class.
25278,896036,Eric,Rentschler,Harvard University,Film,STARE182,5.0,4.0,THE most underrated professor at Harvard. The man is a genius and should at least have a cult following. Highly recommend  this course it will forever change the way you watch film/movies. Don't go by just the course description because it goes above and beyond what can be described in a paragraph. The type of professor where every word compels you
25279,896036,Eric,Rentschler,Harvard University,Film,E182,4.0,4.0,Take any class of his that's offered. Trust me. Just do it.
25280,896036,Eric,Rentschler,Harvard University,Film,STARE176,5.0,2.0,"Highly recommend prof &amp; this course. He is insanely gifted. 1 of best online courses ever taken. Perfect design &amp; management of course; superb reading/film lists; lectures A+; very broad comprehensive topic coverage FAR beyond what I'd anticipated. TA exceptional. Not your typical ""easy film class"" but you'll feel very rewarded by it."
25281,896036,Eric,Rentschler,Harvard University,Film,VES270,3.0,2.0,"nice enough, knowledgeable to a point, teaches good material, easy with very little feedback, not really up to date and easily intimidated by anyone who has his own ideas. avoid if you can."

25298,1174380,Greg,Tucci,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME1A,3.0,5.0,"Tucci has a well run class that has lots of structure. His lectures are usually entertaining but can be very boring. He reads you a PowerPoint lecture and you write on the copies of slides he (kindly) provides. The exams are consistently harder than the ""practice"" problems, and always have tricky Q's that you've never seen before!"
25299,1174380,Greg,Tucci,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEME1,5.0,4.0,outstanding prof.  Had him for the 7 week summer intensive
25300,1174380,Greg,Tucci,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEMS1AB,5.0,3.0,"Had Tucci for S-1AB during summer of '10. He was a blast, as well as his teaching partner, Dr. Matchacheep. I really understood my chemistry."
25303,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,ENV105,1.0,5.0,"He tries to cover too many topics, his class structure and readings are all over the place and his lectures did not help to better understand the materials.  Very surprising that Harvard would employ him.  Wish I could have dropped him."
25304,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,ENV105,4.0,2.0,Sustainability Frameworks Guru!
25305,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,ENVR105,3.5,3.0,"Dr. Pojasek is a good guy.  He's very passionate about what he does, and he seems to get a bit uptight/excited about Sustainability when someone disagrees with him.  How can you blame him?  He is the leader in the field.  Don't be afraid to take his course.  You will learn a great deal and be able to apply it to the real world!"
25306,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,E105,1.0,3.0,"Poor performance all around, avoid courses taught by this professor. Unprepared for classes, untimely content delivery, poor grammar throughout content, and often gets side-tracked when delivering lectures. Very knowledgeable individual, but lacks the appropriate delivery to convey the content in a meaningful manner. Not a Harvard level performer."
25307,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,ENVRE200,5.0,1.0,Professor Pojasek is one of the best Professors in the Master's program of Sustainability and Environmental Management. He is clear and concise. He shares his vast experience and his knowledge of risk management and how to apply internaional standards (ISOs)in corporate settings is highly useful. He is always there for you if you have questions.
25308,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,ENVR105,1.0,5.0,"Pojasek is the worst professor I have ever had.I feel bad saying that, because he seems like a nice guy and wants to help.But people pay a lot of money for this and ought to know.The course was based on his unhelpful lectures and his poorly written narratives.His administration of the class was farcically inept. Stay away from this horrible class."
25309,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,E105,1.0,4.0,I took E-135 before taking this class (E-105). My expectations were high. Dr Pojasek seems like a nice guy but I had a negative experience overall. The course material is dense and abstract and direction seemed completely off as if Dr Pojasek was bored after teaching this class 10 years. Terrible introduction to sustainability. Look elsewhere!
25310,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,ENVR105,3.0,2.0,"Bob is really smart, generally efficient, and very focused. Definitely in charge of the class. He's helpful, but you sometimes have to push him because he travels a lot. You can't sit on your laurels and expect him to put up with you. You have to push, politely, back. I liked him. But, he's not going to pamper you."
25311,1727391,Robert,Pojasek,Harvard University,Environmental Studies,ENVRE105,1.5,4.0,Professor Pojasek is an amiable character and may be good in his career. He has very poor public speaking skills and even worse writing skills. I have never seen a person with such an ability to talk and write forever and say nothing of value. His lectures consist of irrelevant ramblings and corny old personal stories which he tells over and over.
25312,69626,Melissa,Barry,Harvard University,Philosophy,PHIL200,1.0,2.0,Extremely unclear in directions. This Prof. does not answer questions in class professionally and makes students feel as though they are stupid. Worst Prof. ever! Do not sign up for her classes.

25328,264952,Eric,Jacobsen,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEM17,5.0,3.0,"Only professor I know of that could write, erase and talk at the same time. Despite his status, he helped students during many office hours. It was a tough class but he made easier with good explanations and pictures."
25329,264952,Eric,Jacobsen,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEM30,5.0,5.0,Best Chemistry Professor that Harvard has.

25332,264952,Eric,Jacobsen,Harvard University,Chemistry,CHEM17,5.0,5.0,It was the hardest class I've taken at Harvard.  Jacobsen makes graying 40+ professors seem sexy again.

25339,412944,Steven,Pinker,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYCHLAW,3.5,2.0,"The course was ""The Neuroscience of Law"" and was offered jointly with the law school, but no longer is.  Professor Pinker is a genius, no doubt.  But he's incredibly arrogant.  I was put off by the requirement that we buy several of his books and his unwillingness to answer questions when he doesn't feel like it."
25340,412944,Steven,Pinker,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIB1,1.5,2.0,Professor Pinker doesn't really entertain any views that contradict his own ----- even when his views are FAR generally accepted.
25342,412944,Steven,Pinker,Harvard University,Psychology,SCIENCEB62,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting, very funny, awesome class.  I strongly suggest it."
25344,448757,Brian,Little,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1701,5.0,1.0,"I took his class almost 10 years ago and it has changed my life! I still remember what he taught and the way he taught it.  Totally inspiring.  More teachers need to be like him. If you read this, THANK YOU!!"
25345,448757,Brian,Little,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC,5.0,1.0,Brian is not a 5 but a 6. No prof comes close to his humours way of imparting knowledge. Simply one of the best minds of an institution and knows how to relate to students. His teaching style has been an inspiration to me.
25346,448757,Brian,Little,Harvard University,Psychology,PSYC332,5.0,2.0,"Professor Little is brilliant and the most inspiring man I've ever had the pleasure to learn from. He is charismatic - piloerections the entire time! Plus he cares deeply about his students and will do anything for you to help you find your passion and succeed. I can't say enough good things about him! Do the journal option, well worth the effort!"

25353,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,REL355,5.0,3.0,"Saved the Vatican, found the Grail, stopped the Apocalypse, looks like Tom Hanks, has Mickey Mouse watch, etc. etc. What more do you want from a typical, non-existent career symbologist? One of the best professors I've ever had."
25354,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,REL355,5.0,3.0,"His class was great, but to get extra credits I had to save the Vatican City and Paris from a group of people that wanted to destroy the religious institutions. It was quite a hard job just to get those 2 extra credits."
25355,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,ANTH300,2.0,3.0,Professor Langdon is a good lecturer but most of the things he teaches seem taken right out of the Da Vinci Code. He starts well but then he goes off on conspiracy theories and other nonsense. I got an A only because I don't think he ever red my papersd and graded me on class participation. Take his class before he gets wacked by some maniac.
25356,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,REL355,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Langdon is a very intelligent professor who's passion for religious symbology is expressed greatly in his course material. He is a little hard to reach outside of class as he leaves the country often to consult other organizations, but would definetely take again."
25357,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,REL355,5.0,3.0,Love this professor
25358,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,REL355,3.5,4.0,He's an amazing symbolist and just amazing at code breaking
25359,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,DNBRWN,4.5,4.0,"Informative when he showed up. Great lecturer. Always away doing weird stuff with the Vatican or the government or what not. Always has horrible injuries and random love interests. Does look like Tom Hanks, though. Also: I haven't been able to get my girlfriend pregnant recently. Other friends have the same issue. Wonder what that's about?"
25360,655517,Robert,Langdon,Harvard University,Religion,REL355,4.0,3.0,Dr. Langdon's Religious Symbology class was incredibly interesting and his knowledge of the subject is truly unparalleled. He also looks a lot like Tom Hanks.
25361,1191302,Henry Louis,Gates,Harvard University,Ethnic Studies,E100,1.0,4.0,Terrible Prof. Uninformative lectures. Acted like he didn't even want to be in class.
25362,1191302,Henry Louis,Gates,Harvard University,Ethnic Studies,GFDIDSGFD,3.0,3.0,OK teacher. Hard to understand.
25363,1191302,Henry Louis,Gates,Harvard University,Ethnic Studies,HIST101,2.0,4.0,Not very respectful.

25365,1191302,Henry Louis,Gates,Harvard University,Ethnic Studies,HIST201,1.0,5.0,Very concerned with himself
25366,1191302,Henry Louis,Gates,Harvard University,Ethnic Studies,HIST222,1.0,5.0,He is utterly useless as an instructor. Quite unclear and unruley. Extremely into hisself and not clear in what is required. Stay away as he is not a beneficial professor.
25367,1191302,Henry Louis,Gates,Harvard University,Ethnic Studies,HIST201,3.0,5.0,"He's passionate to say the least, but inspiring and in you work hard you reap the benefits.  If you're a slacker you'll hate him.  And you have to take some of his examples with a grain of salt.  Its a class it's not reality people!"
25368,1191302,Henry Louis,Gates,Harvard University,Ethnic Studies,ETH311,2.0,5.0,Hard and stubborn.
25369,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,5.0,1.0,One word: suits.  My count is 14. Extremely helpful and detailed explanations.
25370,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,4.5,3.0,"""So good!"" Although i think a lot of the course makes you think, super nice"
25371,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,4.0,3.0,"Such a good prof!  Although, he tends to be confusing during lectures.  I think he doesn't spend enough time on the complex things and explains the unimportant concepts to death."
25372,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,4.5,3.0,"It's a really interesting course.  I think you're going to be surprised.   Only prof I know who's want to be called by their first name and is unusually excited for everything. I'll never forget ""so good"".  "
25373,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,5.0,1.0,It's good I would take it again
25374,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,4.0,2.0,"He makes a lot of connections which are hard to follow sometimes in lecture so, ASK FOR CLARIFICATION!!! He can explain it really well in a one-on-one.  Also, he has some silly tendencies. I will never forget ""So good!"" as his voice suddenly goes into another octave. LOL  Also, there isn't an exam for this course, just so you know. ++++++++"
25375,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,3.5,1.0,"so he's really good at talking and his notes are really easy to understand that being said, show up to his lectures.  otherwise, you will not truly think about how it applies to you. he has many analogies, some silly and strange, but others provocative and profound. the class is fair"
25376,1945672,Andrew (Ze),Wang,Harvard University,Psychology,PSY1553,4.5,2.0,"So,   I'm really happy with the course so far.  It is fairly knew and we have many instructors.  Apparently, this guy is brand-new and hasn't taught before, but he is an AMAZING lecturer.  The best way I can describe him is as a really large child.  I'm learning a lot and the concepts are much easier to understand when compared to my other courses."
25377,185550,Christine,Korsgaard,Harvard University,Philosophy,PHIL168,1.0,4.0,She literally reads from a piece of paper. Just read her books. Not worth the class time.

25381,185550,Christine,Korsgaard,Harvard University,Philosophy,PHIL168,4.5,4.0,"This class is incredible. Korsgaard gives a deep, sustained, sympathetic reading of Kant's ""Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals"". The short papers are hard, but Kant's arguments are complex and need the attention. Korsgaard's lectures are extremely clear and well-presented. Her books, esp. Kingdom, are excellent supplements."
25382,185550,Christine,Korsgaard,Harvard University,Philosophy,PHIL,1.0,1.0,"Too stuck on herself, if that counts for anything. It doesn't make learning interesting. Philosophy is inherently interesting though."
25383,185550,Christine,Korsgaard,Harvard University,Philosophy,PHIL168,4.0,3.0,A brilliant philosopher -and- a great lecturer.
25384,226418,Gordon,Teskey,Harvard University,English,ENG120,5.0,2.0,"Slightly obsessed with his style &amp; general amazing-ness. His ideas on Shakespeare encompass the works of a genius in a clear, unbelievably intelligent and developed way. This combined with an unpretentious, approachable demeanor make him the kind of person I strive to be (and at the same time am terrified of)."

However, I agree he doesn't really ""teach"" per se - he instead blazes through a bunch of stuff that is boring review for people who've seen it before and incomprehensible for those who haven't."

25402,430814,John,Lenger,Harvard University,Journalism,JOUR202,5.0,4.0,"John is a real asset to the Journalism Department at Harvard. He is very encouraging and care about students - he wants us to learn and do well so that we can get good jobs.

GO AZTECS!!!"
25406,430814,John,Lenger,Harvard University,Journalism,CREAE35,1.0,1.0,"Why bother? This course is less than useless, because it takes up your time, and yet teaches nothing nor challenges you at all. This instructor should be fired."

He is not responsive to emails and not the clearest speaker - having a solid psych background would definitely help - but his TA is phenomenal, and together they make a winning team. If you're a strong writer, it's not hard to do well - entire grade is based on two papers."

To respond to the pompous freshman who gave the first rating, at least Menand knows how to spell ""teach"" (unless you're trying to make some sort of neologism between ""read"" and ""teach,"" smartass).

109702,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MODPO,5.0,4.0,Changed my life. Opened up poetry to me. Opportunity to be a better poet and reader. Al rocks.
109703,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MODPO,5.0,3.0,Al was an amazing 'lecturer' - learning comes about because we discover things - not because he tells us.
109704,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MODPO,5.0,3.0,"ModPo is just a great course. Accessible, democratic, valuable and engaging. Prof. Filreis teaching style is always evolving and unique in its enthusiasm"

I've taken his Coursera Modern Poetry course twice, and have enrolled for the next session. It is such a joy to be part of this international group of learners."
109706,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MODPO13,5.0,3.0,Amazing course. Amazing experience. Amazing professor.
109707,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MODPO2UPENN,4.5,5.0,My first MOOC.  I was fascinated with the whole process.  I came out of curiosity and stayed for the party without missing one assigned even though the course is ungraded.
109708,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MOPO13,4.5,4.0,Taught me how to close read a text. Highly recommend
109709,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MODPO2,5.0,3.0,"Al Filreis is amazingly charismatic, generous, and passionate about the material, the course, the MOOC pedagogy, and especially the people. He teaches with a disarming style that inspires his students to stay engaged, dig deeper, and continue learning and sharing great poems and poets. Easily one of the top professors I have ever had at any level."
109710,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MODPO2013,3.5,1.0,The videos were mostly talking heads with no differences in the point of view among the participants. The pace was very uneven. I was extremely interested in the subject and have gone to other on line classes in order to get different perspectives and interpretations. Communications were generally unclear. My time could have been better spent.
109711,813929,Al,Filreis,University of Pennsylvania,English,MOPO2013,5.0,2.0,"Al is passionate, knowledgable, encouraging and hip. Any student who has a class with him is extremely fortunate."

Teaching style is top-level. Can't say enough good about this man. His course was a life-changing experience. I'll always be grateful. But rating categories seem more course related than prof. related. Al is outstanding  across the board! I took ModPo 2x!

109724,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM001,2.0,5.0,"I have nothing against Dr P. If you ask him a question he does his best to answer. Problem is, you can't understand him because he operates in a different scientific level. Hes a good guy. Almost fun. Doesn't want to fail anybody. Helpful to his best ability. Exams are insanely hard though! Class average on all 3 exams was &lt; 50. Heavy curve at end"
109725,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM001,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Pietrovito was the reason I graduated second in my medical school class. He was my first chemistry professor in the Post-baccalaureate Program prior to medical school. His class seemed impossible! However, he was always available to teach outside of class. He was a true mentor and inspirational to me and many others!! He was amazing!"
109726,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"Socially inept and gives painfully long winded lectures while never pausing for questions from the class. The exams are very detailed with what never feels like enough time to complete said exams. He should be teaching graduate students, NOT intro chem to undergrads."
109727,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM001,3.0,5.0,Dr. P is a nice and funny guy sometimes. I had a horrible time understanding him or relating to him. I work full time and cannot utilize his office hours which i understand might have been useful. He has a NO MAKE UP TESTS policy ( you get to drop lowest). Not great for people without 20 hours/week to study/teach themselves the material.
109728,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,3.0,5.0,"Nice guy, hard class."
109729,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,"A revolutionary teacher, if I do say so myself."
109730,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,Completely unintelligible lectures to the average student who is new to chemistry. Do not take Chem 101 with this man
109731,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Dr. P is a great professor. His lectures are extremely clear. He explains the concepts in such an accessible way! He also posts his notes which are great! They explain the information better than the textbook does most of the time. If I could take CHEM 102 with him, I would! Highly recommend"
109732,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM901,4.5,5.0,"Dr. P is incredibly accessible and only wants to see you succeed. Don't hesitate about coming to see him, even if you think it is a stupid question.  He is the best professor I have ever had, and this is coming from a girl who had to take his class twice!"
109733,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,4.0,AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS.
109734,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,102,4.0,5.0,"The man is brilliant, but the kind of brilliant that makes it seem like he's living on another planet. I never went to lecture. It boring as heck and impossible to follow. But what I did do was READ EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT HE POSTS. Its all in there. They are SO LONG but if you know those documents backwards and forwards, you'll ace every exam."
109735,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,4.0,3.0,"Dr. P is a great guy who cares a lot about chemistry. His lectures are really boring but if you are disciplined enough to listen, they can be really enlightening. Must explicitly show all work on tests to receive full points, which is frustrating given the time constraints."
109736,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,4.0,5.0,"LOVE Dr. P. This guy is so dedicated to his craft and only wants you to do well. He gives a lot of his time outside of the classroom to help students in office hours, appointments and in workshops where he mediates problem solving. He can get confusing in class while he is rambling off-topic, but it is all out of his passion for chemistry."
109737,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM001102,4.0,5.0,"Put in the work and you will walk away from his classes an expert, but don't expect it to come easy. Get as much face time with Dr. P as you can. Go to class, recitation, workshops, and office hours if you need it. Be prepared to study 20+ hours a week for his exams: you will need to be able to do the material in your sleep!"
109738,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,2.5,4.0,Great guy!
109739,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM102,4.5,5.0,"Excellent professor, always willing to help. He may get too deep into the details for both lecture and exams but it prepares you for what is ahead."
109740,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM102,3.5,4.0,Could be worse...
109741,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,4.5,4.0,"He's a great chemist but you cannot rely on him to teach you. You must read the chapters and his lecture notes. Once you do put in the work, he's an amazing resource. He will literally derive equations infront of you in seconds and explain it extremely well along the way. Go to office hours!"
109742,610504,Anthony J.,Pietrovito,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM001,5.0,5.0,"What a wonderful teacher! He is tough but he teaches really well, enjoys interacting with students, really cares about his students, and is willing to spend additional time explaining concepts."
109743,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,5.0,4.0,"Provided very interesting perspective to students in the class from an extensive and unique background experience, which made the material very engaging. Converses often with students to help them grasp and think critically about what is covered. Overall, great experience, and would recommend the course and the professor."
109744,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PSYC275,3.5,2.0,"You had to show up at least for the presentations and the weekly quizzes; the rest, you could miss and still do fine in the class. It was definitely necessary to do the readings in order to do well on the quizzes. The information was interesting, but the lectures could get a bit slow and repetitive at times, and it was often easy to just zone out."
109745,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PSYC275,4.5,3.0,Welton was pretty good!
109746,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PSYC275,5.0,4.0,Political Psychology was by far the most interesting class I took this semester and Welton Chang definitely played a role in that. He made the material interesting and engaging. It wasn't an easy class but I never felt lost or too confused because the professor and the TA were both very responsive and helpful.
109747,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,5.0,3.0,"Welton is very knowledgeable and passionate about Superforecasting. He also has a fascinating background (spanning both the public and private sector), and uses it to develop interesting simulations.  Hes also very friendly and approachable. He gives great advice, and I wouldnt hesitate to take a course by him again. I hope we stay in touch!"
109748,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,4.0,3.0,"Welton was my TA/associate professor for the MGMT276. Welton has an awesome background in intelligence and was able to make any topic interesting. Welton was also extremely easy to work with, and always provided relevant and easy to understand  help when asked. Welton was an excellent professor!"
109749,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,5.0,3.0,Welton went above and beyond to make the power points enjoyable by finding humerus comics or cartoons that were based on the information we were learning. He also had a very impressive range of skills and could offer helpful feedback for all of the group discussions. Welton had a very well respected opinion.
109750,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,4.5,4.0,Welton was a great TA for MGMT 276.  He has interesting ideas and challenges students to approach forecasts in new ways.  I appreciated his feedback throughout the class; discussing ideas with him helped me to refine how I think about problems.
109751,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PSYC275,4.5,3.0,"Welton is supportive, accessible, and overall a great pleasure to learn from."
109752,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,5.0,3.0,Welton had a lot of worldly knowledge and experience to draw from to make class more interesting. He was also really understanding of personal conflicts that came up for me during the semester.
109753,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PPE275,4.5,3.0,"Welton was extremely helpful throughout the course. When I was having trouble with group assignments he was understood and did his best to work with me. In class he helped students to see subject matter in a new way, through engaging activities."
109754,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,5.0,3.0,"Welton was a great as a teacher in the class this year. Firstly, due to thevalue his insights and expertise gave to students in a very specifc and competitive subject. But what was great about Welton, was the fact he was willing to discuss, and spend time, explaining his reasoning and forcasting methods to students. He created a welcoming environme"
109755,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PSYC275,5.0,3.0,Brings his professional experience as a military intelligence analyst to the classroom in a very interesting way.
109756,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,5.0,1.0,Really hands on with the students. Only wish he had more of him so that he could spend more time with everyone.
109757,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PSYC275,4.5,3.0,He was super helpful and definitely seemed to take a deep interest in the class.
109758,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PPE275,4.0,3.0,Always had something constructive to say when help was requested.  Responded to e-mails very promptly with specific and clear instructions where required.  Assisted Professor Tetlock in the construction of clear and entertaining slides for the course.
109759,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PPE275401,4.5,3.0,really helped me to develop a more open mind and approach forecasting in a productive way
109760,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,4.5,4.0,Depth of knowledge about US policy and international affairs adds value to class content
109761,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,MGMT276,5.0,3.0,"Welton was an extremely valuable part of my class experience. He often offered his knowledge as extensions of the material, connecting the in-class readings and discussions to his real world experiences. He was clear in class and via email, and highly responsive to any questions and concerns."
109762,2132145,Welton,Chang,University of Pennsylvania,Psychology,PSYC275,4.5,3.0,"Very quality course, engaging as well. Welton made himself very available to answer questions and was open to opposing ideas."
109764,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC218,5.0,4.0,One of the most refreshing seminars I took during my time at Penn. She is able to connect to her students and that's rare.
109765,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC17,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors I've had at Penn! She really cares about her students and wants to see them succeed.
109766,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC18,5.0,4.0,"My last semester at Penn. Will miss her classes. Loved those hours in class, truly life-changing. So humble, so caring..."
109767,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC217,5.0,4.0,One word: INSPIRATIONAL. I loved her as a teacher.
109768,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC16,4.0,4.0,tough but inspirational. read her poems. she is one of a kind!
109769,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC7,5.0,3.0,"A generous soul. Always available even if you are no longer a student. Inspiring and opens up your mind about poetry, Iran and its truly fascinating literary tradition."
109770,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC18,4.0,4.0,"Down-to-earth, and knowledgable. Nominated her for the teaching award. truly a good teacher."
109771,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC6,5.0,3.0,Amazing prof and human being. 100 percent
109772,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC18,5.0,3.0,truly amazing. so happy I took her course. learned a lot and was challenged in every right way. will miss the three-hour weekly class :/ fun guest speaker too.
109773,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC218,4.0,3.0,Very interesting course materials. Fun to read and attend. Short papers could feel a bit much but a good writing practice all round. She is truly a poet-scholar and a great teacher too. usually brings amazing guest speakers and Iranian artists on campus. Would take again
109774,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC18,5.0,3.0,So sad to finish this amazing course... :( she cares a lot about her students which is rare. I struggled a lot with Penn and its unleathy competitive environment and she was by far the best teacher to calm me down at times of crisis. Always accessible outside of classroom. was my third class with her...
109775,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC217,5.0,3.0,The most LGBTQ-friendly prof ever!!! Love her as a human and a scholar. Helped me get through a big crisis in life while under so much pressure to pass my units.
109776,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC218,5.0,3.0,Amazing at explaining difficult concepts/literary texts - funny and kind. Gotta work hard tho
109777,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC218,5.0,4.0,"Just finishing this course. As a sophomore, I had to take electives and my peers suggested this course. Happy I took it. You gotta work hard but totally worth the effort. My first academic encounter with the middle east was through this course and it changed my view in so many ways. Penn better make this course mandatory for American students!"
109778,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC216,4.0,3.0,Took this course as an elective with no background in literature and poetry. Frankly the only intresting elective Ive taken at Penn so far was this one. Its not demanding but participation and engaging with the materials matter. She cant stand lazy bums tho. So avoid the course if you dont wanna do any work! Id take this course again.
109779,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC2018,4.0,4.0,"She doesnt give A(s) if you dont get ready to read or engage with the material. Well, thats a good thing I guess! But if you are there to be a lasy A(ss) looking for an A choose another class. But this course is seriously good for your soul! So take it and learn something!"
109780,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC218,5.0,4.0,"I already told my advisor this class changed my life. I was constantly challenged to open up to new horizens. To learn new ways of looking at the world and make sense if it, not just Iran and the middle east but in general. She asks questiobs that change your view and definition of many conventions. Refreshing and engaging readings."
109781,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC401,5.0,3.0,"already signed up for my next class with her next semester. a proper Oxford-trained prof. meticulous, analytical, serious and humorous. I wish Penn had more instructors like her. I never had to force myself to go to this class and never felt sleepy while in class. and believe me, that's a HUGE plus for me! I can fall asleep easily. lol"
109782,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NELC216,5.0,3.0,I had fun in this class. The class is focused on a chronological study of Persian poetic tradition. A very good survey course to start from scratch if you don't know anything about the topic. classes are interactive and fun. planning to take her modern lit course next spring!
109783,2348670,Fatemeh,Shams,University of Pennsylvania,Humanities,NLC17,3.0,3.0,A fair professor. I learned some fun stuff. But I wouldn't take again. I guess there's not a healthy atmsphr in her classes. Sort of a weird tension. Maybe it's just me though.
109785,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,5.0,3.0,She was very kind and helpful
109786,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,1.0,2.0,"Awful teacher. Very lazy.  Requires students to spend hours outside of class learning the material through prerecorded lectures, fails to finish reviewing a basic worksheet during lecture. At the end of the day explains how SAIL is inherently superior to all other forms of teaching when, the only reason her students perform is bc they spend 2x time"

109788,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher. Tests are fair, and you can do well if you study appropriately. She is also very helpful during her office hours. Only downside is she sometimes moves too fast through difficult material"
109789,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,4.0,4.0,"Lecture's very entertaining, wouldn't mind going to the her lecture twice per day. She used examples that are funny and different, so it is easier for the students to remember."
109790,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,1.0,5.0,TERRIBLE TEACHER.
109791,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,1.5,5.0,"Stein is such a bad teacher. She makes Microeconomics unnecessarily difficult. Her voice is also incredibly irritating. She can be funny at times, but, to use micro terminology, the marginal cost of being in this class is greater than the marginal benefit. Skip it if you can."
109792,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,5.0,2.0,easy to udstd
109793,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,5.0,3.0,her exams can be tricky. but she's so great and funny. she is the best prof i've ever had. she is very helpful esp during office hours
109794,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,5.0,3.0,her exams can be tricky. but she's great...the best prof i've ever had...she is also helpful esp during office hours.

109796,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON10,4.5,3.0,"Her lectures are crystal clear, even if you didn't read the book. She is very helpful and fair in her grading policy. Despite the low difficulty of micro, its very easy to get a D on the midterm. To ace the midterm, and the quizzes, make sure your answers are jam packed with vocabulary and explanations while being concise."

109801,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,1,5.0,3.0,She is awesome... seriously the best econ prof ever
109803,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,3.0,3.0,"it is easy to be clear when you are just spouting the text book. brought little life to the text, just half a.s.s regurgitation. Quick to refer you to the study guide, but that is no help and it never covers testing mats. be prepared to be testested on math questions that they never really cover."
109804,154485,Rebecca,Stein,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,4.0,4.0,"She's great for lecture, but it's the TA's you need to watch out for!  Midterms and Finals can be tricky...make sure you pay attention in lecture and class (no basic problems like in textbook for tests)"
109806,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I have had yet. Very understanding of the struggles of school, but also encourages people to try in his class. Cares so much about his students and pushes us to learn. I loved this class so much, can't believe I'll miss Thermo!"
109807,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE220,5.0,4.0,"Took intro to materials with Professor Davies; course was awesome, entertaining and interesting. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to learn more about MSE. Great professor!"

109809,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,4.0,"Professor Davies is an amazing professor who truly wants students to learn; best teacher I've had in my major, if not at this entire university."
109810,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,4.0,The best professor I've had at Penn so far--and one of the best teacher's I've ever had.
109811,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,"Davies is engaging, funny, organized and entertaining uses excellent examples to engage his students; one of the best teachers on campus.  Take his course if you get the chance."
109812,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,4.0,I took this course last semester; I have never had a better teacher . Dr. Davies cares so much about his students: awesome
109813,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,260,5.0,4.0,"Took thermo this spring, Dr. Davies spent many extra hours helping me understand concepts.  Really cares about students, best professor I've had so far."
109814,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,3.0,Really good notes and explanations; actually makes Thermodynamics understandable.  Entertaining professor who cares about students and lectures - best I've had this year.
109815,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,"Chemistry is not my favorite subject, but this professor is. He  makes things clear and connects to interesting examples in technology.  Dr. Davies is by far my best prof."
109816,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,"All these comments are true, great professor and funny.  Kept my interest in a course that was hard for me."
109817,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,"Amazing lecturer - relates basic chem to emerging technology, great at keeping our interest."
109818,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,3.0,"Unbelievable at making incomprehensible material understandable and clear.  Best prof in the school, funny too."
109819,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,"Great jokes, very funny.  Connects basic chem to real applications, love this professor"
109820,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,Sooo helpful in office hours and clear in lectures.  Of all my engineering profs he is the absolute best
109821,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,"Currently taking frosh chem; all comments are true.  Fantastic prof, really funny but jokes have a purpose - they help you learn.  Best of all my current teachers"
109822,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,2.0,These ratings are true - clarity to the max and very funny.
109823,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MSE260,5.0,4.0,Amazing at explaining difficult concepts - thermo rocks when Davies is teaching it.
109824,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,Funny very clear explanations - you've got to take one of his classes
109825,923578,Peter,Davies,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,Amazing engineering prof; connects what can be boring material to interesting applications.  Very funny - go to his lectures and sit at the front.
109827,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,5.0,3.0,"As they said, he is a real gem. If you're lucky enough to have him, listen up."
109828,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH115,2.0,4.0,"I took an elementary education math course with him, and it has never been more of a waste of my time. He has no experience teaching younger children, so has no idea how to explain things to us. The majority of the class dealt with him talking about things other than math, and he never returned papers. If you have the choice, don't take him."
109829,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH115,2.0,4.0,Random tangents about the history of Math..Average professor. Confuses us and loves to get off topic
109830,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH1115,1.5,5.0,"I took a lower lever math course specific to education students.  Supposed to be teaching me how to teach young ones how to do math.  He DID NOT do this! He went on a million tangents and was incredibly pompous and arrogant.  He does not appreciate people asking questions, but puts them on the spot in front of the whole class."
109831,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,1.0,4.0,"If you don't already know calculus before you've taken this class, then do NOT take Crotty. He will leave you incredibly confused. He's a really nice person but not so great when it comes to explaining things."
109832,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,4.5,3.0,"Crotty's lecture style is conversational: he employs anecdotes like you wouldn't believe. I would have preferred something else in an intro class where people are learning the math ropes, but I bet he's fantastic in 240 or 241, for example. He can seem intimidating, but he's actually very friendly and helpful. (Even though he looks like a viking.)"
109833,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,1.5,4.0,He was interested in the class but he did not seem interested in the course subject. Would sometimes stray of the topic and confuse students
109834,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH114,5.0,2.0,Prof. Crotty's ability to boil all concepts down to everyday examples and willingness to expend time in story-telling if needed just to make sure the point gets across was refreshing.
109835,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,4.5,1.0,"Maybe the best teacher I had and I failed the class!  Yeah, his tests are hard but he rounds generously and I was getting a B+/A- until the final.  I liked how he always enoucraged me.  He even let me take the final a second time after I failed it the first time.  Super quick about responding to email; had him for 103 and got a B."
109836,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,1.0,5.0,One of the worst experiences because he didn't go over any examples in class
109837,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,1.5,3.0,"Terrible professor!
 He didn't teach or assign work on 1/4 of the syllabus and then put the material on the final.  He also changed the list of relevant chapters to study less than 6 hours before the final."
109839,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,3.0,4.0,"I've had him for Math 104 and Math 240.  Tests are hard as F*CK. He explains great if you keep up with the class, but he uses lots of esoteric words as well, so if you're behind you won't learn sh*t. IMO, he won't ""teach"" you the maerial in class but rather ""decorates it with unnecessary detail."""
109840,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,4.0,"clear, thorough, makes you think"
109841,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH420,5.0,1.0,AWESOME!
109842,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,4.0,4.0,He explains well but his tests are really hard!
109844,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,4.5,2.0,Much better than any of the other professors at explaining the difficult topics.  Also very willing to help and answer questions in and out of class.
109845,178182,Ed,Crotty,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,3.0,3.0,he uses maple a lot and derives formulas for most of the class period.  i find it less confusing to just read the book myself than listen to his explanations.  homeworks usually have some pretty challenging problems.
109847,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON334,3.0,4.0,Read the textbook thoroughly and you will do well on his exams. Also don't wait last minute to start your projects do small amounts over the coarse of the semester.
109848,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON86100,5.0,3.0,"The course on International Trade is a high level course at the Graduate Center. Dr. S. is a kind, genial gentleman, who has worked in International Trade for many years and is an icon in the field. The works involves heavy analysis and presentations of research papers which grants the freedom to learn on your own, and class powerpoints on theory."
109849,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,FINMARKETS,2.0,3.0,"Totally disrespectful towards students. It was not diffucult to get the grade,however the course was quite intense, carried out in a short period of timeActually, the course was useless as the professor did not provide us with any knowledge-not only the presentation was not his, but also he just read the slides which we could do on our own at home"
109850,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON231,1.0,5.0,I so much regret taking his course. All I have learned about Public Finance I learned from the textbook. Making college students read articles aloud in class is nonsense.
109851,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON234,1.0,5.0,I took one class from this loser this last semester as a junior and it stunk.  I got an A grade but the class was sub-standard in every way.  Very befuddled uninsightful instructor.
109852,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON234,1.0,5.0,"This class was a total waste of time because the professor was so bad.  He hardly understands what he is even teaching.  He does not have the skill to teach at the college level, let alone a school such as Penn.  He would be much better suited to teach junior high school, maybe high school.  Do not take his classes, they are horrible."
109853,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON236,1.0,5.0,Absolutly incompetent professor and a total disgrace to Penn.  Class was absolutely atrocious. exams tested on material not even alluded to in class.  Terribly boring lecturer.  Many students did not even bother attending lectures because they were ultimately a waste of time.
109854,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON236,1.0,5.0,"This class was, at its very best, slightly below mediocre.  I would not recommend this class to majors or non-majors."
109855,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON234,1.0,1.0,"I have somehow ended up taking three classes from him, and he is by far the worst teacher I've ever had. He makes generally interesting subjects seem duller and can't teach his subjects at all- you are better off studying independently."
109856,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON261,5.0,2.0,great teacher. i was personally very motivated by what i learned in his class.
109857,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON261,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst professor ever.  He insults his students, presses his political views on them, and tests his class on material not covered (or even in the textbook for that matter).  He was teaching a course in development...but instead we learned about outdated international  trade models and about how much he hates Barack Obama."
109858,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,1.0,4.0,this guy was horrible - had him 10+ years ago...
109859,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON235,1.0,3.0,"Obnoxious, condescending"
109860,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON050,1.0,5.0,Gross!!  What is he doing teaching here??  I pay for this monkey to teach me.
109861,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON050,5.0,1.0,Awesome teach.
109862,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001ETC,5.0,2.0,I heart Yochanan.  What more is there to say?  He's the reason I majored in Econ.
109864,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,1.5,3.0,"He was funny, but I would go ahead and call him a terrible teacher.  I learned -next- to nothing from him.  My TA, on the other hand, was outstanding."
109865,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON050,1.0,5.0,He completely ignored the syllabus and couldn't teach his way out of a paper bag.
109866,6464,Yochanan,Shachmurove,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON053,2.0,3.0,"obnoxious, condescending, and unhelpful;  but importantly, he knows his stuff"
109867,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG393,1.0,3.0,"Professor Loomba is a knowledgeable scholar. You can glean that from reading her many books. As a teacher, however, her pedagogy is non-existent, her feedback is harsh, oddly personal, and often unclear, and she gets overly defensive and even offended when disagreed with. In private, she'll make comments that cut deeply. Beware."
109868,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL316,1.0,4.0,"Professor is unprofessional and condescending. She does not have compassion for non native English speakers or low income students. The professor thinks only her opinions of things are correct. The professor does not respect other cultures and is an intellectual bully, as the previous comment states."
109869,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGLISH595,1.0,3.0,"Terrible experience with Ania Loomba. She is often historically wrong and is a an intellectual bully with little compassion for poor students, though she claims to be postcolonial all day long."
109870,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG000,1.5,5.0,Ania Loomba  is a poor intellectual. If your views are different to those of Loomba she starts raving and ranting and saying amazingly rude things in a crude manner.
109871,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL103,1.0,3.0,"By far the most disrespectful professor I have ever encountered in school. Nasty in office hours. She is not willing to help, clarify, or provide HELPFUL feedback to students. I regret taking her class, and I would not recommend anyone to take her course."
109872,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG214,1.0,5.0,boring and disrespectful.

109874,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG93,5.0,4.0,"She is awesome. Most students say that about professors that are either easy or laid back, (she isn't either one of those things), but what she is is brilliant. Amazingly smart, and will challenge you ideas and how you think. SHE IS NOT RUDE or disrespectful to students in class or in office hours. Don't expect to be coddled but to be challenged."
109875,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL00,3.0,1.0,"Extremely RUDE.  Not as brilliant as others have made her out to be.  Class was fairly easy, rather boring.  Her angry rants should not be mistaken for a genuine interest in the subject matter."
109876,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG000,4.0,5.0,Can be very intense but totally inspirational.
109877,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG393,4.5,4.0,brilliant.
109878,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL000,1.5,4.0,"By far the most disrespectful English Professor I have ever had.  Does not seem to respect other cultures, either."
109879,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL00,1.0,5.0,A shame such an intelligent person cannot be as gifted in dealing with people respectfully.  Exceedingly arrogant and not worth learning from.
109880,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL316,1.0,3.0,"I added her class only to find that she had singled me out in a crude, malicious tone during the first five minutes for adding the class late and not knowing what book we would be using that day.  Other students, as well as professors, later approached me saying that they felt sorry for me and that she was just usually ""mean"" and ""judgemental""."
109881,294522,Ania,Loomba,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG000,1.0,5.0,"She is the reason I didnt become an English major like I thought I would Freshman year.

She takes you not just through the texts, but the surrounding contexts, reading cultures as well as plays, poetry, etc.  She really challenges you to think, to attack questions is ways you never have before.  Plus she is amazingly nice, and brought cookies for us on more than one occasion.  Take a class with her."

Assignments unclear. Takes offence and goes on the attack if you ask her to clarify. Tells students she doesn't have time to help them.  Her general message is that you should just give up."
109888,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,CLST100,2.0,3.0,"Greek/Roman Mythology from Coursera. Pro: Friendly face, FWIW Cons: Tone of voice is casual, hard to differentiate between points, like rambling. Course says no mandatory reading, but lectures as if you've read material-cannot rely on lectures alone or you'll be lost. No AV. No structure in lecture/is confusing. Reading transcript is kind of better"
109889,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,MYTH101,5.0,3.0,Mr Struck breaks down intimidating subjects with ease and in the process his students become engrossed in a classic world- while fully understanding it. He undid the damage high school English did with the Odyssey in the 90's. Thank-you
109890,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,GREEKANDROMAN,4.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've ever had in a Coursera class. I am still thinking about and talking about this class even two years later. Made me passionate about Classics and I haven't turned back since. Would recommend to anyone. He is passionate about his subject and makes you passionate about it too.
109891,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,GREEKANDROMAN,4.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had in a Coursera class. Engaging and passionate - loves the material and makes you love it too. Good at making things accessible. I am still talking about and thinking about this class even a couple years later.

His friendly and approachable lecture style smashed stereotypes about dusty classics, explored deep territory and motivated our huge MOOC with Coursera to light up the discussion boards from all over the world. Yes!"
109893,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,GREEKANDROMAN,5.0,1.0,"Taking this class on Coursera.  Love the lectures, have always been interested in Greek and Roman mythology.  If Prof. Struck isn't Greek, then he should be."

109902,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,GREEKMYTHOLOGY,4.5,2.0,"this guy was awesome. I highly suggest you fin a way to work this class into your schedual. Plus, iot fulfills a general requirement."
109903,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,GREEK1ARISTOT,5.0,4.0,Struck rocks!  Quite approachable and determined to answer your questions.  helped me a lot in the application process for grad schools.
109904,336357,Peter,Struck,University of Pennsylvania,Classics,CLST200,1.0,3.0,"lame.  thinks way too much of himself.  he also, unfortunately, geared the tests and the entire learning of the course towards memorization of names and places instead of really exploring the themes, imagery, and language of the readings.  very disappointing.  it is difficult to take ancient greek tragedy and make it boring - he succeeded."

109926,766730,Frank,Pellicone,University of Pennsylvania,English,ITA217,5.0,4.0,by far the best prof at Penn... always available and makes all classes interesting
109927,766730,Frank,Pellicone,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG240,5.0,4.0,Best class I took in 4 years
109929,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"I had the misfortune of having him for both intro chemistry and biochemistry...I should have just taken biochem with the Biology department. Terrible professor, completely unhelpful, reads verbatim from his textbooks (that you are required to use for Biochem), and recycles tests, making cheating rampant. I'm surprised he's still teaching."
109930,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.5,5.0,"When I went to Dr. Voet's office to ask for help on a topic that I did not understand, he literally told me to ""go figure it out"". He teaches because he has to; he does not care about his students. Take this course with another professor!!"
109931,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM251,1.5,3.0,He was the boringest professor I've ever had.
109932,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM251,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever - he simply repeats verbatim the book that he wrote but the book sucks and is really confusing and unnecessarily detailed. i like how he wants you to understand big picture ideas but he SUCKS at explaining that - both in lecture and in the book. avoid him at all costs
109933,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,2.5,5.0,His class made me hate chemistry so much.  He makes it seem easy in lecture and then he pulls out ridiculous tests.
109934,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,literally wants you to fail. only reason i did well in this course is a fantastic ta. dont even bother going to lecture.
109935,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,I honestly believe Voet teaches awfully on purpose to give kids bad grades in the class. Learn his tricks fast.  Ignore anything he says in lecture and study only the book and the Logan's Notes. He'll try to trick you into thinking that you need to know a thousand formulas. Don't listen!
109936,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,3.0,He aggressively sucked.
109937,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,4.0,I agree. This guy really made me question my decision to pursue a chem major. He should not be teaching. I took a lot of classes at Penn and he was the worst teacher I had...by far!
109938,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,I hate his guts too!!
109939,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,3.0,"I had this guy 4 years ago when I was freshmen at penn.  All I can say is this guy is like a good hazing for potential pre-meds.  He's pretty terrible.  So if you can get by with him, you might be able to survive a lot of things in life."
109940,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"Voet is definitely the worst prof I had at Penn, and I have graduated already! He should not be teaching! It is clear that he teaches only so that his research will be funded -- not out of concern for his students."
109941,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,Everyone hates this man.  Penn should fire him.  Seriously.
109942,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,Worst prof ever.
109947,222545,Donald,Voet,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,worst teacher ever! i hate his guts!
109949,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB475,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lexow challenged me as a thinker, made me overcome my fears of participation w/ her stimulating discussions, and instilled in me the pursuit of challenging literature reviews and peers. Dr. Lexow was present in all the stress and internal struggles I battled at the time, and supported me with passion, understanding, guidance, and maternal care."
109950,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB482,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lexow's classes require a great amount of work to be done outside of class. Lots of reading/understanding of primary literature articles is required, and grades are determined based on presentation of deep analytical abilities with these materials. However, her classes are very rewarding - giving essential skills for the practice of medicine."
109951,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB480,5.0,4.0,Dr. Lexow's seminar courses all have the same general format where you analyze primary literature about that week's topic. Most classes will then explore every aspect of that topic through class discussion. It is therefore imperative to thoroughly and critically evaluate all reading materials provided. You will literally be at the edge of science!
109952,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB475,5.0,4.0,"There is a reason why Dr. Lexow's classes have long wait lists each year. Her class taught me a range of skills that will be essential to me as I aspire to become an informed biomedical professional. I learned to comprehend and synthesize scientific literature with ease. There is a lot of work required each week, but it is highly rewarding."
109953,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB480,5.0,4.0,Dr. Lexow is one of the best professors at Penn. Her classes require a strong background in neuroscience and she pushes her students to think critically about research and the current state of the field. Dr. Lexow gives great feedback and genuinely cares about her students. Id encourage anyone looking for a rewarding challenge to take her classes.
109954,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB480,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lexow is one of the best professors at Penn. You do learn biology in her class, but she gives you so much more - she teaches you new ways of thinking about research and critiquing findings. You will come away a better thinker and a better scientist. Finally, she is an extremely kind and generous person. Penn is lucky to have her."
109955,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB482,5.0,3.0,"She is amazingly inspirational. Reflecting on many classes I took with her, she was an asset all the way! Amazing."
109956,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB482,5.0,1.0,"One of the best at Penn. Dr. Lexow inspired me to actually  read and dive into the class. Paper writing could be a pain, but you were rewarded if you put the time in. She is very supportive outside of class. "
109957,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB275,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Lexow is a really awesome teacher. She's very helpful, gives useful assignments, and grading isn't difficult. I learned a lot from the two classes I took with her and didn't have to do a ton of work.  As I begin my career as a med student next fall, I am grateful that she taught me valuable skills that will help me succeed in the future."
109958,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB482,5.0,3.0,"Amazing! Dr. Lexow truly cares all while pushing you to do well. Her class was definitely one of the most profound learning experiences Iâ€™ve encountered. Material is always interesting and relevant, assignment are straightforward â€“ put in the work &amp; you will get the grade. She even takes the time to email you if you submit a thoughtful assignment"
109959,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB475,5.0,5.0,"Nedra Lexow is hands-down the best professor I have ever had at Penn. She has high expectations, but her enthusiasm and passion are truly inspiring. Taking her courses was the best decision I ever made as a Penn pre-med and if you take one of her classes, you will want to take every class she teaches."
109960,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB482,5.0,3.0,"Before taking this course, I had a very limited scope on health care and medicine. She helps her students understand how research, marketing, and clinical practice all tie in together. Not only does she encourage her students to understand all possible perspectives, she gives us the tools necessary to make informed decisions. Thank you so much!"
109961,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB482,5.0,4.0,"MY EXPECTIONS BEFORE THE CLASS WAS LOW. SHE MOTIVATED ME TO READ MORE ABOUT THE SUBJECT AREA. SHE IS SMART, AND MAKES YOU WORK FOR YOUR GRADE, SOMETHING I DON'T MIND DOING AT ALL. I LEARNT A LOT FROM HER. I WILL RECOMMEND HER CLASS TO HARDWORKING STUDENTS WHO WANTS APPROPRIATE REWARD FOR THEIR PRECIOUS TIME."
109962,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB380,5.0,1.0,amazing
109963,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIBB380,4.5,4.0,"She is a very rare person. Brilliant, ethical and enthusiastic about her work. She expects you to read with an inquisitive mind and to always be anticipating new questions for science research. If you take her class- run with it! She is a rare find!"
109964,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB482,5.0,4.0,she's tough but fun
109965,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB482,5.0,3.0,"This class is very challenging but you learn alot from your research.  People who don't like her style of teaching are usually people who don't like to work for their grades and want an easy A.  Dr. Lexow is a great teacher, I would say one of the best!!"
109966,685129,Nedra,Lexow,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BBB,4.5,3.0,You get to learn about the most up-to-date topics in neuroscience!!!
109968,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI101,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, explains everything well and goes beyond the lesson to impart other important tidbits of information on the class."
109969,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI101,5.0,2.0,Excellent teacher who brings a career of experience and knowledge to the classroom and greatly enhances the helpfulness of the course.
109970,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI101,5.0,2.0,"LT Giles did a great job teaching us what was need to be known. A power point heavy class but it was the best way to teach all the information needed.  He brought in other people in the Navy and Marines to teach specific subjects of their field.  Great class, learned a lot."
109971,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI101,4.5,1.0,LT Giles does a great job making sure the students learn the most important aspects of being in the Navy.  He is very helpful and very practical.
109972,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NS101,5.0,2.0,"I can tell Lt. Giles is very experienced and he makes the knowledge very easy to understand. His class is very useful, I only expected to learn a little more about the other Navy communities."
109973,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NAVSC1001,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Explains things well and a very enjoyable class.
109974,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI101,5.0,3.0,"LT Giles is a great professor and has some ridiculous ""sea stories."" Great, informative class."
109975,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NS101,4.0,2.0,"He is very informative and is always ready to discuss current events. He will teach you exactly what you need to know, because he has experienced much of it himself."

109983,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI101,5.0,3.0,LT Giles is very knowlegable and really knows how to keep a class interested. Highly recommended!
109984,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI101,4.5,3.0,He's not even a full professor and he's the best teacher I've ever had.
109985,1515590,James,Giles,University of Pennsylvania,Science,NSCI102,5.0,3.0,Great class! Very interesting teacher!

109990,131284,Gwen,Eudey,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON10,3.5,1.0,Eudey is very easy. All you have to do to pass her quizzes and exams is memorize the answers to the practice questions she gives you. Those questions will appear word for word on the test and quizzes.
109991,131284,Gwen,Eudey,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON2,3.0,1.0,she uses the class to sell her textbook.
109992,131284,Gwen,Eudey,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON002,4.0,2.0,sHE JUST ROCKS!

110006,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL213,1.0,4.0,"If you can avoid taking class with her, do it. She is not kind or understanding. Once told a student she should reconsider medical school for raising her hand to ask a question. Stating that she felt her lectures are easily understood and therefore there should be no questions."
110007,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,1.0,5.0,"Part of the problem was her incredibly thick accent, but overall I had a terrible experience and had to withdraw after only missing a few lectures due to a severe case of bronchitis. She also constantly referred to her own class as a pre med weed out class, which isnt something professors should do imo. She was very condescending and discouraging."
110008,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,5.0,3.0,"I have never seen a professor as devoted, patient, and har-working as her!!!"
110009,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,4.0,3.0,She genuinely cares about her students and would stay much longer after every class to answer questions as well as provide practice problems.
110010,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,4.0,4.0,"Great professor. if u want clear answers for ur questions from her, u can ask her after class"
110011,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,2.0,1.0,"Aside from being ridiculously out of sync with the textbook and the English language, she was cute. That is all."
110012,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL202,4.5,2.0,"Some issues in clarity, but not so much that you can't figure it out if you try. She is definitely not going to spoon-feed anyone anything, but she is very invested and if you follow her guidelines, the class is significantly more manageable."
110013,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,1.0,5.0,"Undoubtedly, THE WORST educator I have ever had in my entire life. Doesn't speak english--or write tests in understandable english. Has favorites. She even talked about how much she hates her boss. AVOID at all costs...it's worth the money to switch to the day class if you're in LPS."
110014,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,1.5,4.0,"the worst!!                                       moderate to severe language difficulty, deliberately unavailable TA's, poor communication,  lab ahead of lecture, blackboard not utilized, exam problem questions do not match lectures, unable to ""teach"" material and uninterested in changing to improve, responds to favorite students"
110015,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL102,1.5,3.0,"Thick accent, difficult to understand, horrible tests with many typos and problem sets are often outside the scope of the course. As a person she's friendly, interested in her field and easy to catch during office hours/after class etc, however she's close to the top of my list of 'worst professors I've ever had.'"
110016,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,4.0,3.0,"She is not bad. True, there are issues with exams (typos and clarity), however, she is fully invested in her students and interested in their success.  Gives weekly MCAT quizzes relevant to current material, which is extremely helpful for MCAT prep. Overall, you will learn what you need to, and she is definitely knowledgeable.. just be patient"
110017,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,2.5,4.0,"She's far from the worst. She's generous with her time, is very nice, and loves the topic. Language is the biggest problem, as you'll often ask her a question, and she'll simply repeat what she said previously. Exams can be hard, but labs and quizzes are pretty easy. Be prepared to put in the yards and you'll do fine."
110018,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,1.0,5.0,worst!
110019,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,1.0,5.0,"Unhelpful.  Prioritizes research above teaching. Thick accent, cannot convey lessons to students.  Text is wonderful but unhelpful for the purposes of doing well in her class. Makes tests up the night before, they are full of typos and difficult to understand.  Very disorganized."
110020,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,1.5,5.0,She lies.  She is not helpful in anyway.  She will ruin your GPA.  Do not take her.
110022,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,1.0,3.0,She has a good heart but she is a horrible professor. I would discourage anyone from taking her class. It is very hard to understand her and she is very insecure about what she teaches.
110023,862967,X,Witmer,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,1.0,2.0,"Worst professor I've had the displeasure of taking classes with.  Worries more about finished lectures than if students understand.  Exams are horribly worded.  And worst of all, no one can understand a word she says.  Not being a Penn student, this course has discouranged me from taking other Penn courses in the future! F------------------------"

Having attended five universities,  I encountered three great professors: McInerney is one of them."
110026,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH026,4.5,2.0,"One of the most interesting classes I've taken at Penn. McInerney is a great lecturer who is able to hold the attention of the entire class.

110028,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,CLST323,4.0,4.0,"If he taught all my classes, college would be a lot more exciting. He was very accessible during office hours and a reasonable grader."
110029,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH323,5.0,3.0,So interesting to listen to lecture.  He makes my soul smile.
110030,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH26,4.5,3.0,Amazing Prof.  He was my advisor and I probably wouldn't have graduated without his help.  He bent over backwards to help me fight the bureaucracy of the College.  He is an amazing scholar and a very caring advisor/professor.  His lecture style and Australian accent make him very engaging as well.
110031,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH026,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher and a really funny guy in private. Unlike some, I've never had trouble meeting with him for whatever length of time was needed. Once I had to get to the office and had to cut him off (politely btw) Keep in mind that if all you take is the giant ANCH026/027 classes you're not getting the real JMac."
110032,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH027,3.0,4.0,"He's a great lecturer but, in my opinion, a poor overall professor.  You can only meet him for 15 minutes and he's more than happy to kick you out after said 15 minutes.  I had him for a recitation leader and his grading of term papers (there are 2) was insanely hard.  Take this at your own risk."
110033,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH026,3.0,5.0,"dismissive of everyone because he is surrounded by ass-kissing 24/7. loving his class won't get u anywhere because everyone does. he'll let u proclaim ur interest for a 15 minute office hours session and then send u home with a B- for A work. take this class, but do it pass/fail."
110034,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANC,5.0,4.0,"compelling, erudite and dismissive of slackers.  will irritate those looking to be coddled.
 
 everything a professor should be."
110035,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH026,3.0,5.0,"while he is probably the best lecturer at penn, he is such a self-satisfied, unresponsive, student-hating prick, that it negates his likability. he complains about bratty students and threatens absurd deadline consequences as if we're in 5th grade. his impressive lecturing is fueled by pride alone."
110036,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANC101,5.0,3.0,"I loved his class so much, I switched my minor to Ancient History!"
110038,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH027,4.5,3.0,"Fantastic lecturer.  Not my favorite subject, but he captivates me nonetheless.  There's a lot of reading to do for this class."
110039,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH027,5.0,4.0,"wonderful, interesting lectures"
110040,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANCH026,5.0,2.0,The best lecturer I've had; a magnificent storyteller and historian
110041,127095,Jeremy,McInerney,University of Pennsylvania,History,ANTH026,5.0,5.0,Prof. McInerney is spell binding - he jsut tells you a story about history.
110043,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH003,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Monge is brilliant in about ten different ways. Top 3: her love of her subject is infectious, she chooses interesting stuff to cover in every lecture so it's never boring, and she's very funny. It's a class I always want to go to and makes me want to take another anthro class, preferably with her."
110044,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH003,2.0,3.0,"While often an entertaining lecturer and apparently a nice person, she's a frustrating professor. Course is all over the place, syllabus is vague, and tangents take up most of the class time. If you like the material (human evolution, fossils, primates), you might enjoy and learn something in the course, despite her scattered teaching style."
110045,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH122,4.5,3.0,Clearly knows her stuff and expects you to be as passionate as she is about anthropology.  If you're not interested in the material don't take the class it's not a cakewalk.
110046,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH003,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Monge is proof that it is possible to enroll in a course that is both rigorous AND enjoyable.  She's a fantastic educator and is always taking part in great educational experiences outside of class (volunteer projects, lectures, etc.).  She will be missed at the University of Pennsylvania and will be a great asset to another institution."
110047,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH003,1.0,3.0,"My worst experience at Penn. completely disorganized, unprepared, no sense of time. Didn't even update the Blackboard Site from a year and a half ago. Didn't write the exams herself. Exams didn't match up with material emphasized in class. Digressed and wasted our time with boring stories."
110048,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH105,4.0,3.0,"Cool professor, entertaining class. She often has students rolling in the aisles with laughter. Learned a lot."
110049,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTHR260,4.5,3.0,"Great teacher. Engaging, interesting, and fun."
110050,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH210,4.0,3.0,"Very clear, knows a lot and you learn a lot from her class, though you don't realize it. She's also tons of fun."
110051,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTHDEAT,1.5,2.0,As funny as she seems you really don't learn much from her - her tangents are endless &amp; she NEVER references the texts that you bothered reading. I'm sure she is brilliant but she can't teaach and at the end of the day you don't feel any more knowledgable in the topic. Easy A if you don't mind that you didn't learn a thing.
110052,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH403,4.5,3.0,"HILARIOUS, brilliant, sweet professor. She knows her stuff, loves to help, and makes class interesting. True, she went on tangents all of the time, but we learned a lot."
110053,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH003,1.5,3.0,"Personally, she's kind and funny. However, her lectures are far from helpful. People go to class  because they wanna *learn stuff*. She digresses and talks about her life or how great anthropology is (as a field, not the class material) EVERYDAY. Entertaining at the year's start but when midterms come you wish she'd just teach one relevent class."
110054,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH003,4.5,3.0,"Very interesting lectures, amazingly animated professor."
110055,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTHROPOLOGY,5.0,1.0,"Truly one of the better undergraduate professors we have in the department. Her classes are always lively and fun, interesting lesson plans, and exciting discussions. If you feel like stalling, just steer the conversation off topic. The readings can be put off until the midterm and final if need be, but should be done and reviewed as they're really neither too heavy nor too much. Oh and she really enjoys talking about pizza, the italian market, kenyan safaris, and her cats."
110056,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH003ANTH,5.0,3.0,Janet Monge is the best.  You will laugh the entire class and still learn a lot.
110057,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTHRO,5.0,2.0,"so funny, like the old lady on your block with all the cats..  she makes the class fun and always has some story to entertain you when she can tell you're getting tired."
110058,508556,Janet,Monge,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANYTHING,5.0,2.0,Hilarious with a fascinating perspective.

110061,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,1.0,3.0,He is just terrible in accommodating with students and he had too many problems with students. If we can't print his quizzes he makes us COPY the whole thing? He seems to be slight condescending to me. He is strict in a way that is not supporting students.
110062,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Dailey is one of the best science professors I've ever had in my life. He genuinely cares about teaching and wants students to truly learn and understand organic chemistry. The exams are challenging but manageable (if you spread out your studying, ask for help, and are really curious)."
110063,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,1.0,4.0,Complete and total... Fill in the blank
110064,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,1.0,4.0,"So interesting reading positive comments by students in this professor's case, especially the ones about being easy to approach and helpful. Then again, most of those also were written several years ago. Obviously, something has changed."
110065,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,1.0,5.0,Absolutely awful. Has no interest in his students or their well being whatsoever. It's a huge disappointment that a university of the caliber of UPenn keeps an individual such as this on its staff. Clearly ignores the university's professed mission to be mindful of the emotional well being of its students and to recognize needs and provide support.
110066,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,5.0,5.0,"Amazing prof. Hands down the best chemistry professor I've had at Penn. I didn't think orgo could be a good experience, but Dr. Dailey makes it bearable (and almost enjoyable)."
110067,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM443,1.0,5.0,"He's just terrible. Will go on and on about semantical nonsense, and makes test absurdly difficult. Why would you brag that most students make a 30-50 on your exams? If everyone misses it, the problem clearly lies with him."
110068,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM102,2.0,5.0,Horrible horrible horrible. Takes pride in his in knowing he makes killer exams.  So frustrating.
110069,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,4.0,3.0,"Wish I had gotten my act together sophomore year to fully appreciate Professor Dailey's teaching...second semester Ochem is a killer class but he made it tolerable. He genuinely seems to care about teaching, which is rare in Penn's chem department."
110070,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,4.5,4.0,explains everything clearly in class and is very nice and open to questions.
110071,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,4.0,4.0,"Very clear and intelligent prof.  I didn't think I'd like organic chem, but he changed my mind about it."
110072,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,4.0,5.0,Ruined my 4.0
110073,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,5.0,1.0,GOOD TEACHER
110075,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEMI,1.0,5.0,he sucked.
110076,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM242,4.0,4.0,"Taught 2nd semester of organic chem which is TOUGH no matter who teaches it.  Still, he was approachable and conduct lectures very organized.  Available during office hours but need to do lots of problems to prepare for midterms.  Study lots for any orgo."
110077,222553,William P.,Dailey,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM102,5.0,3.0,one of the minority of chem teachers that doesn't completely suck
110078,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI116,4.0,4.0,His lectures and course content were very well planned. Kept the class interesting and motivated. The reading was not unreasonable and was always relevant to the coursework. Prof. Sil's also a very funny guy which keeps the mood in the class light. Just don't interrupt him while he's in the middle of a lecture and get there on time!
110079,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI217,5.0,4.0,great
110080,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI010,5.0,3.0,Prof Sil is easily one of the best professors at Penn.
110081,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI398,5.0,1.0,Rudra Sil is one of the best professors on campus. You are bound to like political science if you took a class with Rudra Sil.
110082,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI116,5.0,4.0,"This is an awesome prof. Funny, clear, and incredibly informative. I wasn't sure about this class when I signed up but it turned out to be my favorite class."
110083,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI116,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class. All the material was fascinating and I learned so much. He covers so much ground in each lecture. He maximized usage of all the time within each lecture very effectively. The lectures were thought-provoking, and extremely organized. He lets us use notes on exams. The exams were fun and did not involve regurgitating information."
110084,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI116,4.5,2.0,Lectures are very clear and he also emails very detailed handouts.
110085,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI290,5.0,4.0,excellent
110086,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI116,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Sil is by far the best prof I've had at Penn.  I've no idea what the person who made the 11/22 comment was smoking. The lectures are great, he's funny, and the class totally changed the way I think about the world.  I highly recommend this prof."
110087,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI116,1.0,1.0,"Professor Sil doesn't seem to care about teaching at all. There's no point in going to lecture because he just reads from the notes he sends out via email. The class is ridiculously easy, but it's also really boring. I'm really disappointed I signed up for this class and would not recommend registering for Sil's classes."
110090,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI9,4.5,3.0,Dr Sil is an unbelievably great teacher in his clarity and entertainment value.
110091,6465,Rudra,Sil,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,POLISCI001,4.5,3.0,Very clear in his lectures...ties things to the Simpsons well!  Also funny.
110092,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON101,5.0,1.0,the best !!!!
110093,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON010,2.0,4.0,"Seems like a nice guy, but does not explain things very well. Hard class overall"
110094,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,1.0,4.0,"Almost impossible to understand. Also, not a very pleasant human being. Econ can be interesting, but he makes it dry, boring, and soul-crushing."
110095,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,4.0,1.0,he's accent is hard to follow. But the lecture is quite interesting. Book is somehow useless here if you attend every lecture.
110096,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,4.0,1.0,"I love his accent, even though it's sometimes difficult to understand. He made the class very inetersting."
110097,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON101,1.5,4.0,If you have never studied economics before than Spiegel will not make your life any easier. His lectures are very dry and he is very hard to understand due to his accent. He is an awesome economist but he fails to present his material in a coherent way. Spiegel loves math and equations so if you want economics with math than choose him.
110098,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,1.5,4.0,His lectures are very difficult to understand unless you review the material ahead of time.  He does not present the material in an organized and logical way.  Lecture is not the best place to see the material for the first time.
110100,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,4.5,1.0,"Obviously the first kid's comment is idiotic, considering he ****ing misspelled thick (he put think). His accent isn't too bad, it's way too built up. He is math based, and gives you lots of ways to get the answer quickly if you attend lecture."
110101,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,2.5,3.0,"His accent was way too think. If it weren't for that, I might have actually been able to stay awake in class and learned something."
110102,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,3.5,3.0,"Tries to be helpful and is knowledgable, but has difficulty with technology and is hard to understand"
110103,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Spiegel is a super nice man but his accent is very strong.  His class is more math based than other Econ 1 classes.  His lectures can be very boring, but he at least trys.  He is a readily avail in office hours, where he can help you a ton."
110105,262854,Uri,Spiegel,University of Pennsylvania,Economics,ECON001,2.5,3.0,"Wants to be as helpful as he can, but you simply can't understand him in lecture.  He has a heavy accent and is technologically incompetant (either the mic doesn't work or it hisses constantly)."
110107,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,4.0,Teaches the most popular math courses on campus and is widely respected for his quality and energy he brings to all his lectures
110108,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,3.0,"The kid! Great, thorough teacher."
110109,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,4.0,4.0,"Prof Rimmer is a fixture within the Penn Math Department. I like him a lot, and had two classes with him, back to back. However, be forewarned - he is hard, and despite his easy-going lecture style, he is tough on certain mathematical pet peeves. Would only recommend taking him in an online course if very adequately prepared."
110110,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,5.0,4.0,Literally am so sad that I won't be having him for all my math courses at Penn. He's a professor who actually likes to teach and wants his students to succeed. He's also willing to take any extra initiatives to make sure students understand the material.
110111,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,3.0,"Rimmer was an awesome professor! Honestly, if you don't do well in this class it's because you weren't really prepared to take it."
110112,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors I've had at Penn! He really cares about his students and wants to see them succeed.
110113,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,4.5,4.0,Great professor. Definitely takes time and effort in his work. He has so many resources that he lets students use so they can do well. He will always answer any questions you have. Tests are tough but lectures are always funny and entertaining. I would definitely recommend taking his class. Best math professor at Penn!
110114,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,4.5,2.0,He's very dedicated to his teaching career.
110116,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,5.0,4.0,He is GREAT! His teaching actually makes you enjoy math. I want to continue taking courses with him.
110117,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,5.0,3.0,I think he's great!!
110118,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH241,4.5,4.0,"I liked his teaching style a lot, especially since the material and text was so hard to understand. Unfortunately, he wasn't the person making the exams the year I had him, and the exams were common. So things got competitive. Then when it was time to do grade break downs a lot of my class had the same grade so every point mattered to the decimal."
110119,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,3.0,"He's a pretty cool guy. Definitely knows his stuff. He makes the occasional math error in lecture, but he's good about correcting himself."
110120,1158957,Nakia,Rimmer,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,5.0,3.0,Great Professor. Probably one of the best I've head at Penn. His lectures are cleary and he is extremely helpful. One of the few professors at this school that actually care about teaching.
110122,394608,Avery,Goldstein,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,POLS259,5.0,3.0,"He's a great lecturer and is incredibly passionate about what he teaches. He's also very good at explaining complex ideas in simple terms. Pretty funny and clearly cares about his students. He's a relatively easy grader, but has high standards for discussion in class - don't make throw-away comments just for the sake of talking in class."
110123,394608,Avery,Goldstein,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI151,4.5,4.0,"One of the best lecturers I have ever had class with. Clear, concise, and very interesting.   One of the best classes I've ever had. Information is useful, interesting, and presented in an engaging fashion.  A must-take (along with his other classes) for anyone interested in international affairs (even out of major)."
110124,394608,Avery,Goldstein,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PS219,4.5,3.0,Amazing teacher. Makes Chinese history and domestic politics sound absolutely fascinating. Lectures on Chinese foreign policies are phenomenal.
110125,394608,Avery,Goldstein,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI151,5.0,4.0,"This prof. is definitely the most interesting and engaging one I've had so far at Penn. His lectures are clear and to the point. In his office hours, he will always make you think beyond the basics and make you analyze every situation critically."
110127,394608,Avery,Goldstein,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI151,5.0,3.0,"Attendance not strictly mandatory, but HIGHLY recommended."
110128,394608,Avery,Goldstein,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI219,5.0,4.0,An awesome professor!  One of my absolute favorites at Penn.  Lectures are straight forward and clear.  Funny and keeps class interesting!

110134,394608,Avery,Goldstein,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI150,5.0,4.0,He's amazing. Had him last semester - most I've ever learned in a course. Funny and attractive too.
110135,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CIS260,1.0,4.0,He shouts while giving his lectures.  The course is made to appear tougher than it actually is.
110136,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CIS160,4.5,3.0,Great professor. Very knowledgeable. Manages to make the most mundane math topics interesting. Great person too.
110137,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CSE260,3.0,5.0,Very difficult but very knowledgeable
110138,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CSE260,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers at Penn.
110139,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CSE260261,5.0,4.0,Anyone who can make a class on set theory something to look forward to is obviously a gifted teacher!
110141,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CSE260,5.0,4.0,"FANTASTIC, amazing professor. One of the best at Penn. Really cares, really goes out of his way. Teaching is excellent. Very fair. On top of all that -- he's extraordinarily funny. And a very nice guy."
110142,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CSE261,2.0,4.0,"8 years after graduating, I can say with confidence that this course is useless to the professional software engineer.  Mintz's influence keeps it in the core CSE courses, but SW methodology or lifecycle courses would be much better.  He is hurting us."
110143,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CSE262,5.0,3.0,The most quotable professor I ever had.
110146,155916,Max,Mintz,University of Pennsylvania,Computer Science,CSE2601,5.0,4.0,AWESOME prof!! He really cares about teaching and is something of an institution at Penn CS. His courses are highly recommended - but beware the he fails around 20% of each class!
110148,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI135,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Fetni is an amazing professor. His ideas are inspirational and he encourages different opinions and perspectives in class. He's very accessible outside of class; a lot of us dropped by at his office to discuss course materials of general political matters. There'd be a lot of readings, but he would cover all the content in his lectures anyways."
110149,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI235,1.0,5.0,HE IS THE BEST
110150,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI135920,4.5,2.0,enthusiastic in teaching and humorous in giving examples.
110151,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCMULI,5.0,2.0,"Unbelievable! So intelligent and loves to share his knowledge. Comes from Algeria and had a horrifying childhood, lost multiple family members but still worked to become one of the best professor's at Penn."
110152,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,IRLAW,4.0,3.0,"Interesting Professor, interesting person. Encouraged questions unlike other Upenn Prof., which many won't even let you ask them, you have to ask their grad students. Also answered questions ranging on all political topics."
110153,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI235,4.5,4.0,This guy is the greatest.
110154,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,HIST101,5.0,1.0,the best in penn university
110155,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,INTERNLAW,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fetni is a very knowledgable and remarkable professor. Although he is a practicing attorney, he knows how to circumvent leagalese in layman terms. This is a class you should take!"
110156,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,PSCI367,5.0,3.0,"I took an international law class at drexel which he was teaching.I really liked him and I thought he was an amazing professor, although some of my classmates were upset by his ""cockiness"" .. he expects people to be ontime and work hard, but regardless hes a great professor who encourages discussion"
110157,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI135,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Fetni's awesome.  He taught me in the first class I took at Penn.  It was a night class and he kept our energy up with interesting side-stories to the subject matter.  He would make you defend your opinion without belittling you, or making you look foolish - not so with some Penn Profs..."
110158,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOC,4.0,2.0,"Interesting lectures, likable guy; workload reasonable; likes punctuality, but also professionalism; knows his stuff."
110159,498311,Hocine,Fetni,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,ADVISOR,1.0,5.0,advised me when i was a pre-freshman. he told me i must take all pre-med classes if i had the slightest inkling of interest in medicine. that was after yelling at me 10 min for being 5 min late to MY meeting. it was my first time on campus. i didn't pay for advice on punctuality azz. do ur job.
110161,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK604,5.0,3.0,"Ditty brings an upbeat mood to class. His lectures are entertaining, helping students stay engaged. With little effort, Ditty comes up with many great examples of each concept we cover; he's very knowledgeable. He is also approachable, welcoming any and all questions students may have. To me, he is one of the best professors at SP2."
110162,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK778,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ditty is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the subject of this course: DBT. There was a lot of information packed into this semester course, and I completed the course confidently knowing that I learned a great deal---specifically due to having such a dedicated, genuine, and deeply knowledgeable prof. Highly recommend Prof. Ditty!"
110163,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK744,4.0,3.0,Prof. Ditty is a fantastic teacher! He has a very successful DBT practice in Delaware and is brings in a lot of direct clinical research with him. I think he combines the research and practical experience (concrete software to use and when) to inform future practitioners. Very recommended but you gotta like research!
110164,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK744,2.5,4.0,"Ditty is a pretty cool guy. He talks about DBT a lot because that is what he works with. We do mindfulness exercise at the beginning of every class. He lectures the whole time, even if he runs out of things to do he makes us sit there. Very rarely do we ever get out early and by early I mean at least 5 mins. He's funny though and very honest."
110165,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,COS126,5.0,1.0,nice
110166,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SW615,4.5,3.0,"Professor Ditty is single-handedly improving my perspective on research.  He makes it fun, relevant, and links our learning to subjects we care about. The class is difficult, but he supports us and constantly expresses encouragement. Matthew Ditty is a great professor, one of the best I've taken, and a human being I respect a hell of a lot. "
110167,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWK,2.5,3.0,Really boring and arrogant
110168,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,CLASS,3.5,3.0,"Matt is such a great professor. I found the material of the class to be rather dry, but it was still my favorite class to attend every week. He typically bring in his own real world experience to help bridge the material to your practice. He is very willing to help students. Don't take the class if you don't want to be challenged!"
110169,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,602,4.5,3.0,He is awesome. Very helpful and makes class interesting an fun. He brought his dog into class to prove a point about a theory. Definitely recommend taking him!
110170,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK602,5.0,2.0,Very great professor. He will work with you as long as you are willing to work.
110171,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK612,4.0,3.0,"I loved Ditty's quirkiness and the fact that he really cares about his students.  He does tend to be a little sensitive, especially if you challenge him, but he's also very approachable. He's funny and is open to talk with students outside of class.  Definitely recommend taking him."
110172,1798689,Matthew,Ditty,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK601,4.0,1.0,"Good classroom environment, supportive teacher who wants students to understand assignments, open to feedback from students, wants students to do well and be passionate about swrk."
110173,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,GAFL732,5.0,2.0,the best professor I have had at Penn. Knew his stuff and could analyze in a non-partisan fashion.
110174,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI130,5.0,4.0,"He is a very charismatic and inspiring speaker who makes things I previously found boring instead fascinating and relevant. The multiple choice midterm was extremely tricky, with a lot of ""All of the above"" or ""Both A &amp; B"" options about random details instead of the main ideas of texts. You really need to read all the material thoroughly."
110175,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI130,4.5,4.0,Awesome
110176,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI440,4.5,3.0,An amazing mentor!
110177,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI400,5.0,3.0,He is awesome!  By far the best professor.  He is also just an all around great human being.

After Sept. 11, 01, it was hard to find an Amer. who didn't think it a good idea.""   WHAT WORLD IS HE LIVING IN!!!"
110179,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI130,5.0,3.0,Best professor I ever had.
110180,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,POLISCI130,2.0,3.0,very overrated and very full of himself
110181,57512,John,Diiulio,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,POLSCI,5.0,3.0,Impressive calloboration between him and James Q. Wilson of UCLA especially when it came to his musings.
110185,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,NPLD790,5.0,2.0,Open my eyes
110186,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,SWRK601,5.0,3.0,"Lamas is interested in real critical social work - not anti-intellectualism. Some students became frightened when he threw out the syllabus - if you are at school simply for the ""credentials"" then save space in the class for those who will actually benefit. I will reference Lamas and the work we did probably forever."
110187,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,URBS,5.0,1.0,He is a very different type of professor than most others I've had at school so far. He is very passionate about community development and cares a great deal about his students. When it comes to grading he is more than fair. If you are at all interested community development I recommend you take his class.
110188,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,URBS,4.5,3.0,An inspiring and brilliant man who is extremely dedicated to helping students find innovative solutions to societal problems. His course will give you a taste of an authentic education.
110189,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,SWRK601,2.0,4.0,"While he is a great thinker, persuasive and great at encouraging students to push their limits... he is extremely condescending and at times hurtful.  But, he will throw out the syllabus, which at times can be horrible or awesome, allowing for more creative forms of work - like multimedia submissions... its a toss up!   "
110190,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,URBS405,4.5,4.0,"This is an awesome class if you are interested in learning, especially free-form learning. Andy has many resources, and is a creativeflexible instructor. He is also demanding: he expects you to bring as much passion to the work as he does. I highly recommend his class if you want to cultivate your intellectual awareness and opinions of the world"
110191,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,URBS405,4.0,3.0,"This class offers plenty of interesting material, some flexibility. Its often engaging;sometimes a bit overwhelming. Professor Lamas pulls in incredibly interesting sources; at times it seems like too much, at other times it seems like a miracle to encounter such gems. Discussions can be feisty; students are encouraged to take risks."
110192,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,SWRK601,2.0,4.0,"Expectations were not clear and constantly changing.  He was insulting and condescending, and though I liked the way he encouraged us to do real-wold policy projects, the fact that he threw out our syllabus left me totally unprepared for future coursework in policy.  By the time he started warming up to us, it was too late.  Worst class I ever had."
110193,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,DYN671,4.5,4.0,I was skeptical about his teaching style but I learned tremendously from prof Lamas. He made me want to go to class and awoke my appetite for learning. If you want to be challenged academically and intellectually take his class.
110194,542640,Andrew,Lamas,University of Pennsylvania,Social Science,COMMCAPACITY,5.0,3.0,"One of the best, most unique approaches to ""macro"" social work.  I really appreciated how he tied in so many different aspects of what is important in life in order to build community capacity.  Andrew Lamas is a hero."

110196,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,63,3.5,3.0,he's super cool and funny. does this shrug when he's lecturing. helps if you ask and really knows his stuff
110197,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,4.0,Best Math 104 Professor ever!! Doesn't care that students don't care about math and recognizes that its just a requirement so focuses on the practical stuff: Acing the final
110198,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,1.0,Best math 104 prof!!!
110199,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,4.0,"Your examples were so clear and concise, I left every class glad that I was
 in your lecture and no one else's.  Prof. Van Erp is a tremendous asset to whatever university he teaches at, extremely brilliant"
110200,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,4.0,"VanErp is an excellent teacher, his lectures are clear and to the point.  It is obvious that he cares about his students, by taking time to go over difficult areas of the curriculum with him.  I would recommend him to all students."
110201,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,5.0,"Erik is the greatest MATH 104 teacher. Tells you only what you need to know for the tests. He's straight forward and he tends to summarize the lectures in steps (1,2,3) and reviews which is a plus in a class that moves in such a fast pace. You'll love his shrugs and humor. Still hate calculus but Erik rocks."
110202,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,3.0,best professor to have for 104. only teaches what you need to know for the exam...other students in other sections would  use my notes to study for their exams. ends class early alot too
110203,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,4.0,He is a talented teacher.
110204,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,3.0,Very clear teaching.  Highly recommend.
110205,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,5.0,3.0,"He is very helpful, and basically  teaches you everything you need to know to help you get an A on the final. He skips complicated mathematical proofs, etc. so kids taking math 104 for the love of math alone will be disappointed. Everyone else is happy. Because he genuinely wants to help you."
110206,935648,Erik,van Erp,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,4.5,4.0,realizes that most people are taking this course to fulfill a requirement. doesn't give you any more information than needed to solve the problems. very good when it came to preping class for finals.
110207,131530,Zoltan,Domotor,University of Pennsylvania,Philosophy,STSC026,3.0,3.0,What a champ. Wish he was my dad.
110208,131530,Zoltan,Domotor,University of Pennsylvania,Philosophy,STSCSPTI,5.0,2.0,"HOW COULD ANYONE GIVE BIG Z A POOR RATING???  Philosophy of Space &amp; Time was a cool class and Zoltan was hilarious.  Class isn't hard at all either, though there is a bunch of annoying memorization.  Interesting material though."
110209,131530,Zoltan,Domotor,University of Pennsylvania,Philosophy,LOGIC101,5.0,2.0,"Excellent prof with a great sense of humor, he takes great interest in his students"
110210,131530,Zoltan,Domotor,University of Pennsylvania,Philosophy,LOGIC101,4.0,3.0,"I loved this class.  Prof. Domotor is very funny, actually, and if you get logic, the course is a real breath of fresh air.  I took it as an elective, and I couldn't bear to drop it, so I sacrificed an English credit for it!"
110211,131530,Zoltan,Domotor,University of Pennsylvania,Philosophy,PHIL05,5.0,3.0,Extremely clear.
110216,131530,Zoltan,Domotor,University of Pennsylvania,Philosophy,LOGIC,1.5,5.0,"This class was so dull, putting it after lunch was tortuous.  Domotor is impossible to understand, and his TAs couldn't make it any clearer.  His melodic drone is a good cure for insomnia, though."
110217,427842,.,Dadal,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,5.0,4.0,Fevzi is a great and funny professor. He is always willing to answer questions and help. He makes learning the material enjoyable though it is at an accelerated pace. His tests have tough grading though. I'm in 102 and he's been the best out of 3 professors.
110218,427842,.,Dadal,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO475,3.5,2.0,"He was a nice guy, but his exams were pretty tough, especially the take-homes.  Everything was open book."
110219,427842,.,Dadal,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,1.0,4.0,"He's very nice, and very entertaining in class. His accent is one that is not hard to get used to. However, he presents the most simple material in an unneccessarily  complex and hard-to-follow way. The content of the first exam could not be predicted by anyone."
110222,427842,.,Dadal,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIO101,4.0,4.0,i love this man
110228,470683,Alan,Johnson,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYS171,5.0,4.0,Professor Johnson has a classic experimental physicist's humor which he infuses throughout his great lectures. He genuinely cares about how well the class is grasping the material as he takes care on his explanations which makes him a great professor for this honors course. He is very open during office hours and gives great help with the homework.
110229,470683,Alan,Johnson,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHSY351,4.5,4.0,"Best physics professor at Penn, hands down. He should teach every class. Sad to see Durian's teaching it now, that guy has pitiful ratings."
110230,470683,Alan,Johnson,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYS150,5.0,5.0,Solid.  In-depth.  Fun.
110231,470683,Alan,Johnson,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYS230,4.0,4.0,"Good professor.  Not the greatest, but he's a great guy.  Very helpful."

110234,470683,Alan,Johnson,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYS150,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I've ever had.
110237,470683,Alan,Johnson,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYSICS15,4.5,4.0,he's so sweet. i was having trouble and the guy totally helped me out during his office hours/ not during his office hours. he was really helpful and very willing to give up his time.  did i mention he's really hot?
110239,794220,William,Clee,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH104,2.0,3.0,"It might be the virtual classes, but I just simply don't learn anything from him. I had to resort to Rimmer videos to teach me the course. The Ghrist videos that came with the class were atrocious. Basically, just use Rimmer videos and notes. Clee doesn't give any extra assignments so that's really nice."
110240,794220,William,Clee,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,5.0,3.0,"I had Prof. Clee for the night class (601) and he was an excellent, very reasonable professor. He covered the material very comprehensibly and has a wonderful sense of humor. I'm not sure if it's more me or him, but half my notes were funny things that he says; his lectures are extremely engaging and really give you a taste of the art in math."
110241,794220,William,Clee,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,4.0,4.0,"Clee is a good professor for MATH 240, he is, however, hard. His tests can be rough, and can be substantially more difficult than the practice tests/study guides, but if you do the homework problems, and the extra practice problems, you should be fine, as long as you really have them down. If you skip even one class, it can really set you back."
110242,794220,William,Clee,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,DISC163263,5.0,1.0,"Clee is extremely thorough with his covering of the material. He is extremely nice, and if you have questions and show that you care, he will help you."
110243,794220,William,Clee,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,4.5,1.0,"Great teacher. If you don't like math he will make you interested in it. If your base in math is ""so-so,"" he will explain some lower and upper stuff you will need, and sometimes things you won't need, just for the sake of it."
110244,794220,William,Clee,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,5.0,1.0,Professor Clee is the sweetest man. I really looked forward to his class.  He had a great sense of humor and made math 103 extremely interesting!!
110245,794220,William,Clee,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH103,4.5,1.0,"He is very sweet, helps the student, and also very laid back. He makes the class very interesting, even if you hate math."

However, the class proved to be the best class of the semester! Dr. Marvin is excellent and I appreciate her demanding that students back EVERY claim that they make in class with substantial evidence and conviction... Truely a great class"
110251,48216,Carolyn,Marvin,University of Pennsylvania,Communication,COMM322,5.0,5.0,Excellent professor.
110252,48216,Carolyn,Marvin,University of Pennsylvania,Communication,COMM666,3.0,5.0,Sexy class!!! sexy prof!! The class was about taboo -- It was fun!
110253,48216,Carolyn,Marvin,University of Pennsylvania,Communication,COMM636,1.0,5.0,"Appears to be pretty and sweet, but is extremely unfair--calls her self ""grade-buster"".

110260,133091,Ponzy,Lu,University of Pennsylvania,Science,CHEM022,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Lu is a bitter misanthropic man who takes joy in trying to be extreme beyond all reason.   He bitter views on everything grow tiring as the course continues and he delves into 101 reasons why pre-meds are stupid and biologists are idiots, in fact everyone on earth aside from Dr. Lu is an idiot, at least that's what we've been taught."
110261,133091,Ponzy,Lu,University of Pennsylvania,Science,CHEMCHEM,4.0,1.0,"Unfortunately many students judged Ponzy by his cover. On a one-on-one basis, Ponzy is an excellent professor and deeply interested in students' well-being and helpful in giving career advices."

110269,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,ORGO1,5.0,3.0,Winks is the best. Hilarious and savage. Maybe the best prof ive ever had. He clearly loves chemistry and loves teaching. Hes the man!
110270,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,1.0,3.0,"Not a very good communicator, and taught esoterically. The exams did not reflect anything given in either the lecture or the reading material. Very abrupt and short when asked for help during office hours. Not empathetic when you came with questions that he felt you ""should"" have known the answers. One of the worst professors during my 4y at Penn."
110271,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,ORGO1,1.0,5.0,He's terrible. Instead of helping me when I needed him most he encouraged me to drop out and forget medical school. Luckily I ignored him and am applying to match in vascular surgery this spring. If you're doubting yourself because of things he said to you- know it's not you- it's him.
110272,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,3.0,5.0,"Winkler can teach well enough, however on a personal level, he is demeaning, condescending, and makes efforts to shame students rather than help us. I love chemistry but he turns me away from it. He makes going to class or meeting with him a very unpleasant experience. "

110274,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,2.5,5.0,"went much much too fast. didn't care that nobody understood him.  made ""jokes"" that were demeaning.  just not a nice guy in the classroom.  unpleasant to be around."
110275,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM241,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor. His explanations are 1000x better than the textbook. Plus, unlike other professors, he finishes the material for the semester on time without a rush at the end."
110276,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,ORGO,4.5,2.0,Always available great teacher even though most students will hate the class b/c it's orgo
110277,249296,Jeffrey,Winkler,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,ORGO1,2.0,5.0,Really tough course and Prof Winkler didn't make it any easier.  Exams were much too challenging even for his graduate students.  He needs to gauge students understanding rather than just try to get a good distribution of grades.  Avoid him period...
110278,271059,Jonathan,Steinberg,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST126,5.0,3.0,"The best professor I've ever had. Perhaps the only one who ever really changed my life. On top of being an expert and a bona-fide genius, he's a model of how a professor should act; he engages every student, memorizes their names and invites them to draw on his knowledge and experience should they ever need help during college."
110279,271059,Jonathan,Steinberg,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIS000,5.0,2.0,"One of the few people in this world who has somehow managed to develop a genuine interest in the lives, needs, and potential of others. Incredible. Restored my faith in humanity."
110280,271059,Jonathan,Steinberg,University of Pennsylvania,History,HISTEURO,5.0,4.0,"Brilliant professor, perhaps one of the top three I've ever experienced.  I took his European History module this past summer at Cambridge University and loved every moment of it, though I wish it could have laster longer.  He is thorough, informed, inspiring and fair.  If you are passionate about history, he is your guy.  Good luck and enjoy!"
110281,271059,Jonathan,Steinberg,University of Pennsylvania,History,HISTANY,5.0,2.0,Great professor and one of the few faculty who cares deeply about students. Highly recommended.
110282,271059,Jonathan,Steinberg,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST127,5.0,3.0,"He was my academic advisor, a really nice guy.  I thought the class was a little hard for a history class--I only got an A- on the midterm and I mean, I had the books practically memorized.  A big workload, too, midterm and final exams with essays and short answers as well as a final essay.  But understanding--I failed the final and still got a B."
110284,271059,Jonathan,Steinberg,University of Pennsylvania,History,AMH2010,4.0,2.0,"I haven't had a class with this guy, but I've seen him many times on the history channel, and he knows his stuff. Very interesting!"
110285,271059,Jonathan,Steinberg,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST126,4.5,2.0,Smart prof and very nice. Lectures too early in the morning!!! Easy grader.
110288,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS131,5.0,3.0,I enjoyed Connie B. Scanga PhD course.
110289,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,AP,3.0,5.0,Very tough. Tests are usually more detailed than any information given in class
110290,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS141,5.0,3.0,"What an amazing personality! She's fun, incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. My favorite professor ever!!"
110291,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS132,5.0,4.0,Amazing!
110292,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS131,5.0,4.0,"Loved her! She really levels with each of the students. Knows her stuff and truly loves teaching A&amp;P. Now whenever I recall my basic anatomy, I can hear her crazy laugh :D"
110293,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS131,5.0,3.0,I love her.  She really made A&amp;P interesting.
110294,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS131,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Scanga is awesome!  I would take any course taught by her.  Clear and knowledgeable.  Snarky sense of humor.  Really interested in helping students learn.  Attendance in lecture not mandatory, but if you miss it, will have a really hard time as she doesn't teach straight from text."
110296,424342,Connie,Scanga,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,AP,5.0,5.0,Brilliant.  Driven.  A little intimidating.  Knows her stuff.  Makes you learn A&amp;P.
110298,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI137,4.0,2.0,I just had Prof. Grazian Spring 2018 semester. He was very bubbly and energetic and clearly cared about what he was doing. I did all of the readings and attended most lectures and the material really sunk in. I will be shocked if I don't end up with an A or A-. Easy class that is enjoyable.
110299,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI553,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Grazian is first rate--I highly recommend him.  He knows his stuff and them some!  I took his Ethnographic Field Methods course.   Reading load was no joke, but very valuable.   It was a seminar course, so can't evaluate lectures.  Awesome facilitator and thinker--super engaging and hilarious sense of humor.  Take his course, work hard, enjoy!"
110300,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI137,5.0,3.0,"He has a lot of knowledge about the topics he teaches, his lectures are very organized and clear, with up to date examples. His tests are only about what he taught in class or included on the readers. I still use the books he recommended for other classes and I had a lot of fun during that semester."
110301,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI137,2.5,4.0,Professor Grazian made me see the light... before I had no Idea about how I should dress up before going out on the town... he helped me find my nocturnal self and since then I never go out without a hot outfit on.  I also order my steaks medium because I now know that cooks creativity and artistry is limited by the context of their job. luv u Graz
110302,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI137,3.5,4.0,great reading and very interesting paper topics.
110303,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOC210,5.0,3.0,Very fun teacher!
110304,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOCI137,5.0,3.0,"Loved this class - particularly how DG highlighted the key aspects of the readings using examples. Warning - if he asks you what the capital of Thailand is, DO NOT ANSWER."
110306,435141,David,Grazian,University of Pennsylvania,Sociology,SOC,5.0,3.0,"Grazian was always entertaining, particularly when talking about the Chicago blues. Don't miss his pop culture class, where the readings range from Texas high school football to talk shows to Durkheim."
110308,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,5.0,3.0,Excellent
110309,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,241,3.0,4.0,"He's tough.  He'll ""yell"" at students for being wrong, but the right answer really sticks with the students because of that. The math part of the class was boring and largely unrelated to the homework, but the reason I didn't skip lecture was to hear his wild stories-- he has a tendency to go off on long, fascinating tangents."
110310,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH241,1.0,5.0,"Absolutely the worst professor. Don't ask any questions in his class, or get ready to be yelled at you. He can get easily offended for anything. Not very clear in presenting the material, and intentionally makes it very confusing for students to understand.  "
110311,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH390,5.0,4.0,"The very absolute best teacher I have ever had (or seen) in my entire life. He challenges people to 150% of their abilities and gets 120%, but that's the fun of it. He really inspires. Thank you, Steve."
110312,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I have ever had. Instead of teaching us math, he yells at us for not knowing the information. Midterms are nothing like the homeworks he gives, and there is absolutely no way to prepare. Every single question is a trick question. Offensive to all students, and could care less what they learn. Only has one arm."
110313,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,2.5,5.0,"Sorry for whining about being 'personally reprimanded'. I would delete the post if I could. I was being immature. Shatz is a likeable and brilliant guy, he just doesn't always have the best people skills. I'm sorry."
110314,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,2.0,5.0,"He is a very interesting lecturer, but is very easily offended with students who are struggling with the material/or/ask him questions. And he lets them know he is personally offended with them. I think it is a cultural thing, but it is hard on people with delicate egos who don't like being strictly  and personally reprimanded for nothing.(like me)"
110315,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,1.0,5.0,Doesn't allow us to rate him on the Penn system so I'm doin it here instead.  Apparantly he's afraid that his true colors will show if he uses the Penn Course Review.
110316,936309,Stephen,Shatz,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH240,1.0,5.0,"The absolute worst professor I have ever had.  Not only is he arrogant, but isn't even good at explaining concepts.  Makes fun of students for asking him questions about the material and refuses to answer any of them.  The mathematics department should be humiliated to even be associated with this man."
110318,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely fascinating lectures from someone who watched the whole field develop from the front lines. Tests are not particularly difficult. Tons of extra credit available (like, 6% of your final grade. it's insane)."
110319,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,4.0,4.0,It is extremely time consuming. But the best way to survive is in groups. all tests and take homes can be discussed. learnt most in those sessions trying to crack it. Worth every bit of effort
110320,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,5.0,4.0,"It is definitely a lot of work with the weekly discussions and the many exams but if you put the time into it, you can definitely get an A. He isn't as accessible  as I would have liked outside of lecture but the TA's were very helpful. Overall, this class is a must take, very applicable if you are in the research field."
110321,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,2.5,4.0,"Definitely one of the most time-consuming courses I've  ever taken!  Expect weekly in-class quizzes, weekly online thread discussions (minimum of 2 posts), 2 take home exams, 15 page paper, midterm and final- oh and a group presentation (optional). And if thats not enough he calls on people every lecture- HE WILL PUT YOU ON THE SPOT! "
110322,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,4.5,3.0,You will work hard (and sometimes bang your head on the desk with the time needed for exams or weekly message boards) but it is definitely worth it...and an A is easily within reach if you commit. You will look back and actually feel like you accomplished something. He's a great guy too.
110323,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,5.0,3.0,Best Class I have taken so far
110324,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,4.5,4.0,"Definitely not an easy class, but Dr. Cancro is a great teacher. There are take home exams due before every in-class exam, but they're really helpful for studying. He will most definitely call on you in class. Online discussions are really time-consuming, only marginally useful."
110326,1246921,Michael,Cancro,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL404,2.5,4.0,"He's a cool professor.  However, stay clear of the front seats.  He will call you out to answer questions. Class includes exams, quiz, pop quiz, weekly online discussions on blackboard and 10 page paper. Be prepared for lots of work!!!"
110328,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,NPLD790,5.0,4.0,He made the class fun. He was nice when he brought the pretzels to class.
110329,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,ACCT202,5.0,1.0,Great teacher! I wish he would teach more classes!
110330,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,ACCT202,5.0,1.0,The best professors at University of Pennsylvania that teaches accounting!
110331,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,ACCT202,5.0,1.0,Keep up the good work Dad!
110332,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,ACCT202,5.0,3.0,Ur the best professor that I've had at college so far!
110333,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,NPLD790,5.0,1.0,Tough to keep awake.  Brings soft pretzels to class.  A lot of work before class begins.
110334,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,ACCT9000,3.0,1.0,A lot of work even before the classes begin
110335,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,NPLP786,5.0,3.0,Professor Boylston is a nice man! He gives out good grades for us in class.
110336,1179391,Bruce,Boylston,University of Pennsylvania,Business,NPLP786,4.0,1.0,Professor Boylston cares about the content of the course and is well prepared
110337,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,CINE500,1.0,4.0,"Terrible experience with this professor, despite being a top student in my other courses. Treats students according to how smart she thinks they are. The smarter she thinks you are, the better she will treat you. Very snobby. Will make judgments about you based on where you're from and where you went to school before &amp; will treat you ""accordingly."""
110338,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,CINE500,1.5,4.0,"Intellectually snobby, plays favorites, and is dismissive of the majority of her students.  Is also highly inappropriate and rude at times.  Most lectures are tedious and irrelevant.  AVOID!"
110339,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,CINE500,2.5,4.0,"Brilliant but terribly disorganized and erratic. Very little feedback on written work. Some lectures were great; the vast majority were only so-so. If you are not a film or english major, you may find her problematic."
110340,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL041,1.0,2.0,"She's a moron. Not only is she a blathering idiot, she says things that are beyond politically incorrect and offensive... only to laugh them off. She's horrible."
110341,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG104,5.0,3.0,"Truly original, and lovely human being."
110342,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,90,5.0,3.0,"Very enthusiastic, helpful, and accessible"
110343,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL104,5.0,4.0,Brilliant but has been known to play favorites.  Also seems to have chilly relations with some colleagues (important if you want to use her for a reference or to back an application).
110344,133446,Rita,Barnard,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG202,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant, accessible, and a hot dame"
110345,264694,Kent,Blasie,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"The worst professor I have ever had and could ever imagine. He is a horrible teacher. When you don't understand what he is trying to say (you never will) and ask a question, he will act as if you are an idiot. And your grades on exams come down to pure chance, which didn't work out too well for me."
110346,264694,Kent,Blasie,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,4.0,"Do not underestimate the other negative comments! Armed with a hatred of students, a condescending manner, and a generally mean disposition, Blasie is also an awful professor. He turns simple chemistry concepts into complex gargantuan messes. He clings to a 15 year old slide show and a useless lecture pack. Try to avoid his CHEM 101 at all costs!"
110347,264694,Kent,Blasie,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.5,5.0,"This is the worst professor I have had in my life. He ruined my once like for chemistry, made chemistry a living hell, and treated us like inferiors! I absolutely despised his class. this man should not be teaching. Everyone stay away!"
110348,264694,Kent,Blasie,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.5,3.0,"Blasie has little care for his students.  Pretty said don't show up to my office hour or else.  Grading is done on a poorly formed rubric- very unfair.  Teaches from a worthless ""lecture pack"" with no words!  Make sure to attend class or else you're done for."
110349,264694,Kent,Blasie,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"Blasie was totally disinterested in teaching ,and seemed to have a resentment for students and for them bothering him.  Everyone was afraid to question anything, as he makes the person asking the question an object of ridicule.  So rather than appear stupi"
110351,264694,Kent,Blasie,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,3.0,"This says it all: Blaise mocked students who showed up to his office hours for help. Very unclear in his presentation. He certainly had no love for teaching or concern for the future of chemistry, since he seemed peeved at having to pass along his knowledge to the next generation. I had him in '93!"
110352,264694,Kent,Blasie,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM015,1.0,4.0,"Unhelpful, especially when getting caught up in his calculus derivations of formulas.  Really condescending too.  Bad bad class, bad bad professor."
110353,268324,Peter,Stallybrass,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL016,3.0,2.0,"Incredibly intelligent about his field. Has awesome stories and is super dedicated to his courses and his students. A bit scatterbrained but will be reasonable if he forgets to give an assignment, or will clarify if he forgets explain something. Awesome guy!"
110354,268324,Peter,Stallybrass,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL236,4.0,2.0,Love him. So warm and engaging. I didn't have a problem with the organization of the class. The course introduced me to a set of University resources I may have otherwise not known much about.
110355,268324,Peter,Stallybrass,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG736,4.0,2.0,Great class- Peter's a genius. But he can be quite haphazard in his organization...
110356,268324,Peter,Stallybrass,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL736,5.0,4.0,"Peter is so engaged with so many different disciplines that you can't help but share his fascinations. He was stellar. Grads, be nice to undergrads. We didn't just wake up as grad. students one day (well, I suppose we did, but a lot of work came before)."
110357,268324,Peter,Stallybrass,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG746401,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant, exciting, stimulating, quirky, irreverent prof.  This was an advanced graduate research seminar, though, so perhaps undergrads just don't get what a major genius and incredibly enabling BRILLIANT MAN Peter is. . ."
110360,268324,Peter,Stallybrass,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL101,5.0,3.0,"An excellent speaker, says what he means and means what he says.  Encourages questions from lecture class."
110362,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EMTM580,5.0,3.0,One of the most engaging professors I have ever had the pleasure to learn from. Professor Venkatesh makes the subject come alive and knows the subject so well that he is able to give multiple triangulating explanations that paint a holistic picture of the underlying theories.
110363,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ESE301,5.0,5.0,"He is simply the best professor I have ever had. An interesting, rigorous introduction to probability from both a mathematical perspective and a historical perspective.  - Penn Student"
110364,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ENM503,5.0,3.0,"Lectures are lengthy but engaging.  Each class is a wealth of insight in probability.  Pay attention and there is almost no need to read the book to understand the topics and do the homework.  The clarity with which he delivers the material is inspiring.  Homework usually requires careful thinking, but never impossible."
110365,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EMTM580,5.0,4.0,"Excellent, engaging and brilliant professor. Makes statistics interesting through use of important historical events and stories. Book due out soon, ""The Goddess of Chance"", Oxford University Press. Outstanding Prof!"
110366,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,STATSTAT,5.0,4.0,Don't take too many notes.  Just get the formulae from the book and listen to Santosh's lectures.  He is brilliant.
110367,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,TCOM501,4.5,4.0,Extremely good at lecturing on tough material.  Brings a real excitement to a tough and generally dry field.  Hands out a very significant amount of work though.  Be prepared to bust your butt.
110368,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ENM503,5.0,3.0,"excellent, excellent teacher!  Very clear and well prepared class material.  I'm in grad school now, and I make frequent reference to the notes I took while in Santosh's class."
110369,628285,Santosh,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EE531,1.0,3.0,Not a good professor.  Stay away from his class.
110370,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS390,1.0,2.0,"Honestly, she was by far the worst nursing professor out of my nursing education. She was unsupportive of the students; it almost felt like it was her vs. the students most of the time. I cannot believe an educator (especially at Penn) could and would behave this way toward students."
110371,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,390,1.0,5.0,"I took N390 (Senior Leadership) this past semester with Patty. Lectures are boring, unclear, tests are convoluted, she is extremely defensive, will bite your head off if you push back on anything, she represents the old school kind of nursing education which really needs a makeover.  Not a supportive teacher.  Mean-spirited.  "
110372,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURSINGBSN,1.0,5.0,This professor is extremely defensive and has difficulty answering questions from students. Exam questions are convoluted and were not covered in the lecture materials or text.
110373,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS50,5.0,3.0,"Patty was our introductory professor to the BSN/MSN at Penn. We had her for but one blissful week - really enjoyed her humor, humility, frankness and intelligence. She opened our eyes to the world of nursing and I hope that the journey will be great because of her."
110374,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS370,1.5,4.0,"confusing, vague tests from lectures that don't cover anything specific. Some of the case studies were helpful but they move too fast to learn much. Patty pulls off ""caring"" but she will bite your head off when she feels threatened."
110375,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NURS50,5.0,2.0,Prof. Rogers is engaging and has the students' best interests at heart. Great class.
110376,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,NSG370,1.0,4.0,"Unclear, uncoordinated and uncool.  Tests are out of nowhere and intolerant of questions or comments.  Avoid at all costs."
110377,636305,Patty,Rogers,University of Pennsylvania,Nursing,N50,5.0,1.0,"Sweet teacher!  Will do anything she can to help you, and also tries to get student input/feedback continuously so she doesn't just bore you in class.  Cool lady."
110379,1304015,Jenine,Maeyer,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM053,5.0,3.0,Lab was very straightforward. Jenine and her TAs make the material easy to understand and are effective communicators even if there's a language barrier. They aren't trying to trick you. They want you to understand lab safety and give you everything you need.
110380,1304015,Jenine,Maeyer,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM054,2.5,4.0,"Super disorganized. She's constantly pushing around due dates to a point where it's ridiculous. Also, written exams don't necessarily seem to correlate to what is covered in lecture and lab... otherwise, her lectures are actually good and she seems to care. Just not very organized."
110381,1304015,Jenine,Maeyer,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM053,1.0,3.0,Completely disorganized. Takes off points for no reason. Probably couldn't pass her own class because she doesn't even have a rubric.
110382,1304015,Jenine,Maeyer,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,53,1.5,4.0,She is totally disorganized. Not clear with due dates. Practical exams and written final is on topics you barely discuss.
110383,1304015,Jenine,Maeyer,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM054,1.0,3.0,"After a year of her courses, I can safely say Jenine Maeyer is the worst professor I have ever had. Take NOTHING for granted in her classes. Read and understand the lab procedures (they will have errors), and Google everything--she lifts stuff straight from the web. If she says X won't be on the exam, study it anyway, because it will be."
110384,1304015,Jenine,Maeyer,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM053,1.0,5.0,"She is the closest to a which in the 21st century. She makes things in ""pots."" She is also a terrible teacher. She gave me a C."
110385,1304015,Jenine,Maeyer,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM053,5.0,1.0,Easy to understand. Straightforward.
110387,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL304,5.0,5.0,"Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor. Lectures are well organized and taught in a refreshing interactive style (maybe include too much information at times). Assignments are challenging and time-consuming (homework on current topics every week, various lecture quizzes, three exams), but definitely worth the effort. I learnt a lot"
110388,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL402,4.0,4.0,"Great guy who is passionate about the subject matter. Funny &amp; engaging, lectures are entertaining most of the time but monotonous when nobody answers his questions. When they do though, this class is a lot of fun. Sometimes doesnt explain things well so it will take textbook reading. Tests on DETAILS from slides. Def understand but need 2 memorize2"
110389,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL402,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sanders definitely knows his stuff. And he is quite helpful. However, his exams are really tough, especially the in-class parts (the take-home parts are tough too, but you have a week to solve the problems). Overall, hard but good."
110390,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL402,4.5,4.0,I think Dr. Sanders did a fine teaching job in this course. And he was very helpful if I had any questions. I would recommend biotechnology majors to take this course.
110391,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,4.5,4.0,"The course was very challenging (especially the exams), but the topics were always presented clearly and interestingly. I would recommend taking this course."
110392,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL102,5.0,4.0,Overall I think that Dr. Sanders did an excellent job in teaching lecture and lab. I would recommend taking him as an instructor for both course parts combined. This is a wonderful opportunity.
110393,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL402,5.0,4.0,"It was a challenging course, but very structured, organized, and well-taught. There are four lecture sections, each concludes with a discussion of specific problem set. The exams consist of an in-class and take-home part. I really loved the take-home questions"
110394,1538975,Carsten,Sanders,University of Pennsylvania,Biology,BIOL101,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, very fair, clear and organized."
110396,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK611,5.0,3.0,"So... Casey is absolutely brilliant. You're expected to participate, yes, but it's hard not to. Her lectures are relevant, interesting and thought provoking. Also encourages the class to be sensitive of students from varying backgrounds/opinions, etc. Not a tough grader (from my experience). If you have a chance to take a class with her, do it!"
110397,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK711,5.0,4.0,Casey is an excellent professor. I enjoyed taking her class and learned a great deal.
110398,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK711,5.0,3.0,"Incredible! Casey is so knowledgeable and relatable, and she always made class interesting with discussions, projects, etc. 10/10 would recommend."
110399,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK711,3.0,3.0,Casey is a pretty good professor. Shes very cool and laid back. We have lots of discussions. Tumblr and twitter project can be a bit annoying but the most you will do is read a lot and one big paper at the end
110400,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK611,4.0,3.0,"She was awesome! Some of the assignments were not fully developed and so were confusing but I think it'll get better as she fine-tunes them. She was very passionate and brought up relevant examples which really helped with engagement. She used various modes of teaching ie videos, lecture, class discussion, student presentations, etc."
110401,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK601,5.0,2.0,Knowledgeable but honest when she doesn't know.  Manages to make a pretty dry topic into an interesting 2.5 hours every class.  Plus if someone ever tried to bust in and take you hostage she could handle them!
110402,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK611,4.5,2.0,Casey is one of the most wonderful professors at SP2 she is super helpful!
110403,1552546,Casey,Bohrman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK611,5.0,2.0,"Casey is very energetic and knowledgeable. She looks for creative ways to engage the class, which everyone really appreciates. Of all my classes, this is the one I truly look forward to each week."
110404,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK704,1.0,1.0,Not a star professor ... Mediocre instruction. A true disappointed.
110405,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK704,2.0,2.0,"Seems nice but isn't really. Becomes angry and condescending when people disagree with herself. Is EXTREMELY dismissive. Bills herself as a ''grief and loss' expert'''; she has an esteemd mentor who allows her to write in his books but hadn't published/researched on the topic. Low quality instruction. offers ""help"" but too ""busy"" to offer it..."
110406,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK704,2.0,2.0,"She only knows about medical social work, as that's all she has ever done. If one wants a well- rounded orientation to Advanced Clinical Social Work, it would behoove him or her to take a more well-rounded and knowledgeable professor. I literally had to fact check everything she said..."
110407,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK704,1.0,1.0,"Mediocre instruction. She is all over the place and lacks ""conceptual clarity."" At the end of the semester, most students stated that they felt as if they were not grounded in theory and therefore unprepared for the profession. Students of other clinical professors felt MUCH more prepared."
110408,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK704,1.0,1.0,Just began this semester and am loathing this class... I have a BSW and liked social work before attending her class. I learned more at the BSW level; she isn't challenging me or making the subject interesting. Please DON'T!
110409,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK704,1.0,1.0,"teaches at a VERY basic level, for example, only says one general statement about slides and is not one for detail.  as a result, she does not cover the material/content well.  she expects students to read (since she can't teach...) but does not discuss the readings in class!  Perfect class for an easy A but not so perfect for 'real' learning..."
110410,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK704,2.5,3.0,She's very nice and all but I could not stand her teaching style. She talked over students and kind of had a savior complex that was extremely annoying. She could be really disorganized as well and that was frustrating. I would not take a class with her again.
110411,1553207,Lara,Krawchuk,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK1,4.5,2.0,Very clinically oriented. Has private practice for grief therapy. Great at teaching clinical skills and very compassionate
110413,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,PHYS150,1.0,3.0,"very dry, never really knows what is going on"
110414,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,MAT241,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Carchidi has a very straightforward teaching style. Attend class and do the homeworks and you will be prepared for the test. Provides back exams that model the upcoming exams. Also offers slight grade incentives, like raising highest exam score up a few percentage points while lowering your low score. Note this was only online due to COVID"
110415,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ENM510,1.0,4.0,For ENM 503... Most worthless class I've ever taken. The lectures give you a hand cramp just trying to write everything he scribbles on the board. Half the class doesnt even show up to lecture. The exam questions come out of no where because all of the in-class examples and HWs require the use of Maple or Wolfram. Avoid this course/prof if you can.
110416,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,PHYS151,5.0,4.0,No fluffy stuff. Straight to the contents. Systematic. Good Lecture notes. Good hw problems. Good illustrations on blackboard. Not rushed.
110417,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ESE603,2.0,5.0,This is called Simulation but the course is no way related to simulation but centers around probability ! Many of us do not even have a background in probability !
110418,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ENM510,4.5,4.0,Lecture notes are brilliant!
110419,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ENM510,5.0,4.0,"I will just say one thing about the homework. Solving Dr. Carchidi's homework is just like working on a piece of work of art, because of the elegance, the consistency and the inspiration reflected in these problems."
110420,1298252,Michael,Carchidi,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ENM510,5.0,3.0,"Basic course, Carchidi gave many examples, very clear, useful"
110421,222541,Kenneth,Lande,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYSICS,5.0,4.0,Professor Lande changed my life. Physics is now one of my favorite  classes. Professor Lande gave inspirational lessons and encouraged me to work hard and it payed off. He is an amazing person and professor. He gives great feedback and I would definitely take his class again
110422,222541,Kenneth,Lande,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYSICS,5.0,4.0,Professor Lande changed my life. Physics is now one of my favorite  classes. Professor Lande gave inspirational lessons and encouraged me to work hard and it payed off. He is an amazing person and professor. He gives great feedback and I would definitely take his class again.
110423,222541,Kenneth,Lande,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYSICS,3.0,5.0,"It was the non-Majors class, but everyone there seemed to have taken advanced Physics already.  It was a lot harder than prof made it out to be.  Lande was nice enough to award participation and curve exams.  When he says you'll have the formulas he's not telling the whole truth--study them.  He was wonderfully nice though."
110424,222541,Kenneth,Lande,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYS101PHYS10,3.0,4.0,Professor Lande tries to simplify this class as much as possible.  He is willing to help if you are very proactive about seeking his help.  Beware-- he takes attendance!
110425,222541,Kenneth,Lande,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHY101,1.0,5.0,"I had Lande a few years ago for premed physics.  First off, I must say that I hated physics (beware of physiology in med school.  you can never escape physics).  Lande was slow, boring, and not helpful.  Although he was a nice guy.  Try Sovin if you need to take physics. He's a much better prof."
110426,222541,Kenneth,Lande,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYS150,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. He actually teaches stuff that i can understand. Nice guy. If i was taking 151 i would definitely make sure he's my prof.
110427,222541,Kenneth,Lande,University of Pennsylvania,Physics,PHYS150,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful, kind professor who generously offered time to help with students on homework problems.  Encouraged students to work together in groups at study sessions.  Great guy who wanted us to learn and not worry about grades.  Took both PHYS 150, 151..."
110428,277891,Alan Charles,Kors,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST415,3.0,2.0,Great
110429,277891,Alan Charles,Kors,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST416,4.5,2.0,Kors is incredible!
110430,277891,Alan Charles,Kors,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST415,5.0,3.0,Great professor
110431,277891,Alan Charles,Kors,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST212,5.0,3.0,amazing prof
110432,277891,Alan Charles,Kors,University of Pennsylvania,History,HISTORY,4.5,5.0,"One of the smartest people I have ever met. I really did not understand much of what was going on, but hoped that some of his brilliance would rub off."
110435,550572,Rose,Malague,University of Pennsylvania,Theater,THAR220301,5.0,4.0,She's a wonderful source for an actor to expand their gifts to new demensions never experienced before.
110436,550572,Rose,Malague,University of Pennsylvania,Theater,THAR100,2.5,3.0,"Definitely likes to play favorites--if you're not a theatre major or haven't acted in one of her productions, the bar is significantly higher for a good grade.  She is incredibly arbitrary and makes up the syllabus as she goes along.  We often receive large assignments with less than a week's notice.  The most unprofessional prof I've ever had."
110437,550572,Rose,Malague,University of Pennsylvania,Theater,THAR110,4.5,3.0,"Dr. Malague is extremely animated and passionate about theatre. Not only is she an actress herself, but she is also extremely down to earth and interested in every word that each of her loyal students utters. A definite must for all students with an interest in theatre history."
110438,550572,Rose,Malague,University of Pennsylvania,Theater,MANY,1.5,4.0,Rose has her own agenda and isn't above playing favorites.
110439,550572,Rose,Malague,University of Pennsylvania,Theater,THARTS,5.0,3.0,Great!
110440,550572,Rose,Malague,University of Pennsylvania,Theater,THEATER,3.0,3.0,has a weird persona - is prone to snap when pushed
110441,550572,Rose,Malague,University of Pennsylvania,Theater,THAR120,3.0,4.0,"It depends on your personality whether you'll find her to be BS or not; she focuses on actor-actor connection and objectives excessively, but tries to blend theory and practice pretty successfully. Good intro course if you don't clash with her; I expected at least a B+ or A- but got a B in the class"
110442,567509,Susan,Phillips,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,4.0,Actively discouraging and spiteful towards students. Refused to acknowledge and fix her mistake regarding lecture polling registration and instead blamed and mocked students for it. Forced to apologize for making exams irrelevant and impossible to finish. Just generally not a good professor. Should stick to research
110443,567509,Susan,Phillips,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,2.0,4.0,"Felt like she made things more difficult than they had to be. Material/lectures were all over the place, and it was extremely difficult to figure out how to effectively study for her exams. Would not recommend."
110444,567509,Susan,Phillips,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,4.0,She frequently goes off topic during lectures which makes them hard to follow. She spends hours of class time going over concepts that never showed up on any tests. Very minimal partial credit given on exams! The material was NOT presented clearly at all. The assigned textbook homework had NO resemblance to the exams either!
110445,567509,Susan,Phillips,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,Completely Horrible. Do not take her if you are taking Chem 101
110446,567509,Susan,Phillips,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM054,3.5,3.0,"Major's Chem Lab. Take it, its a small section and the grading is a lot more lenient than regular lab. You do a little more pre and post lab work but I think Dr. Philips runs a better lab than Kozub does. She is pretty reasonable and nice about things, though a little loopy at times. Nice lady."
110449,571450,Marie-Eve,Fecteau,University of Pennsylvania,Medicine,LAIM100,5.0,2.0,Very pragmatic
110450,571450,Marie-Eve,Fecteau,University of Pennsylvania,Medicine,LAIMSURG,5.0,3.0,Awesome teacher!
110451,571450,Marie-Eve,Fecteau,University of Pennsylvania,Medicine,SRGFA,5.0,1.0,Great professor and clinican
110452,571450,Marie-Eve,Fecteau,University of Pennsylvania,Medicine,VETSURG,5.0,4.0,I love her accent
110454,571450,Marie-Eve,Fecteau,University of Pennsylvania,Medicine,VCSN645,5.0,4.0,Awesome Professor!  Her enthusiasm and passion about patient translate in her class presentation. She is well articulate and funny. She is a great role model for women that want to succeed in large animal field.
110456,784381,Jeffrey,Babin,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EAS545,5.0,4.0,Professor Babin has been one of my favorite instructors at Penn. He is a charismatic lecturer who engages students through interactive presentation of the material. Babin motivates his students to interact in class through frequent group breakout sessions and guest speakers.
110457,784381,Jeffrey,Babin,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EAS545,5.0,3.0,Great!
110458,784381,Jeffrey,Babin,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EAS545,5.0,2.0,"really great prof, makes class something you look forward to"
110459,784381,Jeffrey,Babin,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EAS545,5.0,3.0,Prof Babin seems intimidating but is more than willing to help his students in and outside of class.
110460,784381,Jeffrey,Babin,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ESE545,5.0,3.0,a very good professor!
110462,784381,Jeffrey,Babin,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,EAS345,5.0,3.0,"One of the best profs I've had at Penn!  Nice guy, very involved with students, tons of experience and guidance, will even introduce you to VCs and other entrepreneurs.  Learned more in this class than I have in the last 2 years combined in both SEAS &amp; Wharton."
110463,925159,Damon,Freeman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK798,5.0,3.0,Great Professor...Learned Alot...Wish I could have taken hom more. Very Smart... Class was always amazing! Learned so much...Has alot to offer his students!
110464,925159,Damon,Freeman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK603,4.0,4.0,"Dynamic, sincere, thoughtful. I learned a ton in this class and much of it was the reading but a ton more was the teacher and class discussion. He is a gem, SP2 is lucky to have him."
110465,925159,Damon,Freeman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK603,5.0,3.0,"awesome teacher, always gets students to think critically"
110466,925159,Damon,Freeman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK603,5.0,3.0,Great professor and good looking too!
110468,925159,Damon,Freeman,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK603,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, offers great thought-provoking examples to the class. Not that bad to look at, either!"
110470,974679,Eleni,Miltsakaki,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC526,5.0,1.0,Very knowledgeable and passionate.
110471,974679,Eleni,Miltsakaki,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC526,5.0,1.0,Very knowledgeable and passionate professor.
110472,974679,Eleni,Miltsakaki,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDU526,4.5,3.0,I learned a lot in this class! I appreciated the hands-on labs on web 2.0 technologies (I finally know what that is). I now feel I'm up to speed with my students and can use technologies they like to improve my teaching.
110473,974679,Eleni,Miltsakaki,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC526,4.5,3.0,This is an excellent class for everybody who needs a hands-on training on how to use basic technologies in their classes to support learner-centered curricula.
110474,974679,Eleni,Miltsakaki,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC526,1.5,4.0,"I agree 200% with everything the 4/07 comment said. I already have a blog, and I already know how to use Google sites. I also already know how to write a research paper. I was hoping to learn and experiment more with new technology in education. What a waste of time."
110476,974679,Eleni,Miltsakaki,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC639,1.0,4.0,"We learned absolutely nothing except how to create a blog (which we could have figured out on our own). There is $4000 down the drain. She also spent an entire class period teaching us excel, and only how to hide columns. She's difficult to understand sometimes and frequently changed the syllabus. I hated Mondays because of this class."
110477,1119357,Sigal,Ben-Porath,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC524,3.5,3.0,One of those classes where you can learn a lot if you put your mind to it.  Thought provoking lessons in a laid-back environment.  Do your readings to maximize what you learn.
110478,1119357,Sigal,Ben-Porath,University of Pennsylvania,Education,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ben-Porath requires a lot, but the amount of work is worth it!  I came to this class with 0 interest in Phil. of Ed..  Every week our discussions are so interesting that I find myself drawn to all of her topics.  She replies to every reading response and provides prompt, useful feedback.  Again, definitely recommend!"
110479,1119357,Sigal,Ben-Porath,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC545,5.0,3.0,A sweet and wonderful teacher!
110480,1119357,Sigal,Ben-Porath,University of Pennsylvania,Education,SBP101,1.0,5.0,not good
110481,1119357,Sigal,Ben-Porath,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC545,5.0,4.0,"Ben-Porath is smart, helpful, and a great teacher. She does especially well with seminar-type classes."
110482,1119357,Sigal,Ben-Porath,University of Pennsylvania,Education,EDUC544,3.0,3.0,"Sigal was unable to pull together interesting class discussions. Maybe it was the class size and not her fault, but regardless of fault it was not worth my money. She lectures, instead of tying things together. She also gives very little helpful feedback on the assignments."
110484,1303135,Yechiel,Schur,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST201A,2.0,1.0,Dr. Schur is a virtual einstein. How Penn ever landed such a professor I'll never know. He deserves instant tenure. Taking his class is an experience that everyone should have at least once in their lifetime.
110485,1303135,Yechiel,Schur,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST101,5.0,5.0,Wonderful class! I love Dr. Schur!!!
110486,1303135,Yechiel,Schur,University of Pennsylvania,History,HISTA,5.0,4.0,"Good class! I adored Dr. Schur then, I still do, and always will!"
110487,1303135,Yechiel,Schur,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST201B,5.0,4.0,Dr. Schur is a phenomenal professor. Great class!
110488,1303135,Yechiel,Schur,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST401,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Schur presented ""Death in Medieval Judaism and Christianity"" very well. I like how he did not require additional research for the final exercise. I would happily take this class again!"
110489,1303135,Yechiel,Schur,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST201B,5.0,3.0,Excellent class!
110490,1303135,Yechiel,Schur,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST201A,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Schur is the type of professor you expect to encounter at an ivy league university. He is professional, efficient and has an acute attention to detail. Dr. Schur is friendly without being a people pleaser and an eloquent speaker with no trace of arrogance. Exceptional instructors and intellectuals like Dr. Schur are seldom found in academia."
110492,1438988,Gomaa,Omar,University of Pennsylvania,Geology,GEOL100,4.0,2.0,"Great professor who cares about his students. If you memorize everything from the note packets he gives in class, you can get a very high score. Out of the four midterms, only one was especially hard, covering material we didn't cover in class (but he curved the class to account for this). Easy A"
110493,1438988,Gomaa,Omar,University of Pennsylvania,Geology,GEOL100,4.0,5.0,"Gomaa is a really entertaining lecturer, and I found that the more attention I paid the more the material stuck in my head (even as a firm social sciences student). Don't take if you're socially anxious - he WILL make you engage with the class. The tests are absolutely insane."
110494,1438988,Gomaa,Omar,University of Pennsylvania,Geology,GEOL100,4.0,2.0,"Lectures were interesting and entertaining. As a social science major, this is the first hard science class that I've ever enjoyed. It's nothing but memorization and the tests are easy as long as you study."
110495,1438988,Gomaa,Omar,University of Pennsylvania,Geology,GEOL100,1.0,1.0,"Professor is disorganized, unprofessional, and acts inappropriately toward women in class."
110496,1438988,Gomaa,Omar,University of Pennsylvania,Geology,GEOL100,2.0,5.0,"Unprofessional. Prints his slide deck but slides are out of order, the content is different, etc. Even exams are poorly constructed - entire groups of questions are duplicates. These are mistakes that can easily be fixed but he seem to be unconcerned with such details. His conduct in class is also immature."
110497,1438988,Gomaa,Omar,University of Pennsylvania,Geology,GEOL100,4.0,4.0,"I love Omar! Great class, funny, organized, informative. Exams tedious and very long, asked for every little bit of minutia he mentioned in lecture."
110498,1438988,Gomaa,Omar,University of Pennsylvania,Geology,GEOL100,4.5,4.0,"Classes were informative.  Professor very nice.  Only 3 tests.  no other work required.  But tests, although multiple choice, VERY EXTENSIVE.  Some information asked not on slides."
110500,1586235,Vijay,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,INFOSEC781,5.0,5.0,If there is such a title as a cyber samurai this prof is it. He is a far cry from all the other profs who just preach. This prof does a lot of deep show and tell. He is also a real internetwork expert and cyber hacker. He recommends key books but honestly he should be teaching the guys who write the books. He is an expert++ and demands precision.
110501,1586235,Vijay,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,INFOSEC781,5.0,5.0,"Hardest class I have taken. You need to know everything - servers, routers, switches, vmware, programming, bits, bytes. Prof knows all this inside and out - has real world practical experience. You will get no credit for something that sort of works - class demands very high level of precision and perfection to become a cyber kung fu master."
110502,1586235,Vijay,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ISSC682,5.0,5.0,For professor the network either works or not - very binary 1 or 0. No partial credit after so much work. Always available to help understand concepts but you need to put in lots lots  of effort and show you want to learn. All classes hands on and  shows you so many tricks. Part of DoD cyber warrior program - pretty serious stuff.
110503,1586235,Vijay,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ISSC340,5.0,2.0,clear on assignments and easy on grading.  easy work load for the week.
110504,1586235,Vijay,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,INFOSEC682,5.0,5.0,"Professor is way passionate about security and really knows it inside out. His eyes and red lips get way intense when he is so focused on topic. Prof is always online 2am, 5am, 10pm - doesn't matter he can do a conference call anytime. He needs perfection so you need make sure you learn the material and core concepts."
110505,1586235,Vijay,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,INFOS421,5.0,3.0,Very very hard to get an A in this class. Instructor is always helpful and I always get response in less that 5 minutes. Instructor is a real cyber and internet expert - he teaches but also does detail show in class. No credit for attendance like other classes but if you want to learn you need to show up or you lose a lot.
110506,1586235,Vijay,Venkatesh,University of Pennsylvania,Engineering,ENG151,5.0,3.0,The professor is quite open to discussion and  the class shows how to use the security tricks. He is not big on deadlines but be careful - if you don't do the work in time you will be lost on the next week's homework. Make sure to submit all papers before last day of class and you are good. Don't expect to get any credit for showing up to class.
110507,43442,Toni,Bowers,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL100,2.0,4.0,Boring and very restrictive in her approach.
110508,43442,Toni,Bowers,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENG100,3.0,3.0,"Super nice person.  At least in the class I took, I thought she relied too heavily on textbook readings, on quizzes, and on her TA.  (The particular TA I had was a prima donna and made life unpleasant.)  Maybe because it was only a sophomore-level class, but I thought the general feeling was more like high school than college."
110509,43442,Toni,Bowers,University of Pennsylvania,English,ENGL553,5.0,5.0,Toni is just a lovely person and a very generous scholar.

110520,153813,Arthur,Waldron,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST160,2.0,3.0,"Arthur Waldron is a sweet professor interested in the history of himself. Each lecture, we spend around 45 minutes discussing  an anecdote about his schooldays in England and the next 45 on the lecture, but only in the most indirect way possible. His syllabus claims rigorous analysis but his lecture style is anything but.  "
110521,153813,Arthur,Waldron,University of Pennsylvania,History,HIST160,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors at Penn.

110535,238172,Patrick,Wehner,University of Pennsylvania,English,CINE009,5.0,1.0,Dr. Wehner's writing seminar was easy and rather instructive.  The class meetings were on the dull side.

110541,326229,Don,Berry,University of Pennsylvania,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.5,4.0,"Had this guy for Major's Section. Don't take it, he makes everything harder than it really is. He co-taugh with Park, who cannot speak English for the life of her. His sense of humor is not for all and his approach to things is definitely not for everyone. The test are fairly hard and you can make mistakes easily. So take regular."

110569,466534,Marie,Gottschalk,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI237,1.0,4.0,"Absolutely a nightmare... her class was extremely disorganized. The course packet is about 2500 pages long, with most of the readings in articles. Became nearly impossible to keep track of all the articles that you have to read. Even worse, so many of the readings, often the long ones, were irrelevant to what was covered. TA was great "
110570,466534,Marie,Gottschalk,University of Pennsylvania,Political Science,PSCI10,5.0,3.0,"Very interesting class, very engaged professor and high interest in teaching people to think."

110575,623514,Walter,Palmer,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SW603,4.0,3.0,"Professor Palmer is a great person and truly works for the personal liberation of his students. There are some frustrating aspects of being in his classroom, but ultimately the learning experience trumps those challenges. Don't take his class if you're not willing to openly discuss your own racial background."
110576,623514,Walter,Palmer,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SWRK603,4.0,4.0,"Palmer's intelligence, passion, and articulation of complex social justice ideas are very striking.  It is fascinating to hear him speak.  You must do the reading, because he will assign mini-presentations of readings at the last minute, which is annoying-but worth it.  I feel his course forever changed the way I think about race and U.S. history."
110577,623514,Walter,Palmer,University of Pennsylvania,Social Work,SW603,4.0,5.0,Prof Palmer is extremely passionate about teaching young people and making a difference in society.  He is an excellent role model and lives his life by his teachings.  His class is inspiring.  Buy the books and be prepared to do the readings!

110581,633277,Herman,Gluck,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH601,1.0,3.0,"He's even worse than last semester. Doesn't prove anything that can't be done by just drawing a picture. By not proving anything he can keep a very fast pace, but keeping up with the textbook is impossible (unless you don't want to understand proofs i.e. you don't want to understand at all). Please go teach undergrads as they don't want rigor."
110582,633277,Herman,Gluck,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH600,3.0,3.0,"A problem with the course is assigning so much homework that there isn't enough time to read the text. This is a problem, because of the lack of rigor. For someone already familiar with the material, I would guess the course is pretty ideal. For everyone else the course is far from it. The 2nd year grads also seem to either love it or hate it."
110583,633277,Herman,Gluck,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH600,4.0,4.0,"My favorite course this semester! The class covers too much material to go through the proofs in class, so we spend most of the class time with examples; proofs are assigned as homework reading or exercises. (There are good proofs in the literature but few good examples!) Decent lecturer. Looking forward to 601!"
110584,633277,Herman,Gluck,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH600,1.5,3.0,Gives no definitions and very few rigorous proofs. Ignores the fact that a 1st year graduate course in differential geometry is supposed to teach tools and techniques with the goal of being able to use them in other fields. His course is equivalent to teaching grad cosmology out of Hawkins' A Brief History of Time. Useless and worst course ever.
110585,633277,Herman,Gluck,University of Pennsylvania,Mathematics,MATH202,5.0,4.0,"When I had Professor Gluck, he took particular care to make sure that every student understood what we were learning. I thought he was excellent."

I highly recommend his class!"
110594,678353,Gregory,Urban,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTH002,4.0,3.0,"This is the professor you wished you'd always had.

110596,678353,Gregory,Urban,University of Pennsylvania,Anthropology,ANTHROPOLOGY,5.0,2.0,Fun and interesting professor who always manages to engage his students to perform at the limits of their capabilities. One of the department gems.

131825,2404072,Dinny,Aletheiani,Yale University,East Asian Studies,INDN150,1.0,2.0,Biggest waste of time. You will pass if you can stand to show up every day.
131826,2404072,Dinny,Aletheiani,Yale University,East Asian Studies,INDN140,1.0,3.0,"Everything was disorganized because she is lacking in computer savviness. No one knew what was going on. Take another class or another professor, if at all possible. You will thank me later."

131834,2404072,Dinny,Aletheiani,Yale University,East Asian Studies,INDN150,1.0,2.0,The worst professor here. Select another.

I worked harder and re-wrote more than ever before, and when I compare where I started to where I ended, I'm blown away by how far I've come under his guidance. He cheers and critiques when needed, and provides amazing feedback. Tough, but worth it!"

He knows what makes a script go from good to great and he helps you get there. The amount of assignments are not for the faint of heart. However, if you put in the effort, you'll see the rewards in your writing. "
131857,692839,Marc,Lapadula,Yale University,Film,487,5.0,4.0,"The advanced screenwriting class is no joke; you must produce your best work in the form of a feature screenplay. The class is structured so that you feel prepared to take on a feature script, although that particular task is and always will be daunting no matter who you are. "

Inspiring and life-changing. You'll see the world differently after taking this course."
131867,1456235,Ramamurti,Shankar,Yale University,Physics,PHY200,5.0,3.0,"I watched this professor's lectures on Open Yale courses that were recorded in 2006. As an IB student, it gave me a lot of insight on what physics with calculus is like in university and better cultured me for IB physics HL."

131887,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,4.0,3.0,"This man has moved my mind to think when others left me yawning. I wish I could describe accurately the amazing way he has taught me to think again. I owe him so much, and I hope he finds some small happiness in knowing this. What do you say about a fellow who teaches you how to think about how to live an die? Please pay attention to this man."
131888,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL120,2.0,3.0,His lecture is great but I think there is a lot of hypes about him. His style is erratic but he is too full of himself at times. Actually just watch his online course and do the reading is enough. You don't really need to take his course to learn writing especially he grades in a totally irrational way.
131889,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,4.5,3.0,My favorite professor I've had so far.
131890,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,3.5,2.0,"Found on Yale Open Courses. Wonderful, thought provoking lecturer! Thank you Yale Online!"
131891,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,LIFE,4.5,4.0,He was good
131892,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,76,4.5,3.0,While I personally differ from his beliefs but the way he presents his case is very convincing.
131893,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,4.0,1.0,He seemed like a good professor who gets students thinking.
131894,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,4.5,2.0,One word - inspirational!
131895,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,5.0,1.0,"Shelly is inspiring and genious and can drive your thought to challenging paths so goal achieved. I get tired only because I have to think too much of interesting issues. I am Greek, I could only love it!"
131896,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,4.5,1.0,"good, clear"
131897,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL179,4.5,3.0,"Shelly Kagan is a brilliant philosopher, I enjoy hearing everything that he says as its always full of great insight that can help open minded people shape their own world view. Shelly Kagan is also one of the only people I have seen debate william lane craig and completely destroy him. I have so many questions I wish to ask Shelly Kagan still."
131898,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL179,3.5,4.0,"Very experienced both in his field and teaching. Comfortable in the room and makes you comfortable and engaged, so long as you are interested in the topic. At times he seems to stray from his own rules of philosophy, but other than that a great professor. Being the hardest grader on campus is a bit of a bear to deal with, but really no problem."
131899,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHI1,5.0,3.0,"He is a genius, and has explained the concepts by using simple analogies. If you dont like him you are mistaken and should try taking a philosophy professor at a city or state school, you will come running back to him. his videos on youtube are an A+"
131900,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHLDEAT,3.5,5.0,"Powerful mind tainted by hubris. I respected his stances, but has a large problem admitting fault, or using dissoi logoi in the correctly. He skirts this issue by making sure to mention dissent often - problem is, he always mentions it on his terms, not on its. Very much so professes, instead of educates, but ""indoctrinates"" is too harsh a word."
131901,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176,4.5,4.0,Keep an open mind.
131902,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,DEATHSECT,2.0,3.0,"He does not ""teach"" as much as he tries to indoctrinate.  Unable to admit (even to himself) how closed-minded he actually is or when he is mistaken.  Frequently rude and quick to take offense.  The course material is interesting, but he is far from being the ideal person to relate it to students.  One of the worst professors I've ever had.  Ever."
131903,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHILSECT,4.5,2.0,He is adorable and fun....can't wait to take his seminar next term.
131904,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL176B,3.0,5.0,"Lectures are good when his huge ego doesn't get in the way. Clearly aware of his own brilliance, but not capable of appreciating the insights of others. Insists his graders give ridiculously low grades. Extremely harsh in his assessment of students - more than one aspiring philosophy major has changed fields after asking him for an opinion."
131905,136044,Shelly,Kagan,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL080,5.0,3.0,"If you have the opportunity to take the freshman seminar ""Life,"" do it! It is one of the best, most interesting classes I have ever taken."

131907,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,ORGO301,4.0,4.0,"She is truly an astounding individual. I would take her again. The class is hard, all orgo classes are.

131908,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,"Outstanding professor and mentor. She dedicated her life to preparing her students for both chemistry and life. She definitely had tough love, but I wouldn't be as successful today without her."
131909,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,CHM100,1.0,2.0,"like others have said, awful professor. you can see that she tries, but she is disorganized, forgetful and painfully miserable and boring to learn with."
131910,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,CHEM113,1.0,1.0,"Avoid this professor like the plague. I took her ""advanced"" gen chem lab class (which was disbanded the year after I took it- not sure if they brought it back) and STARS. Totally unhelpful, was absent for most of class, her choice of TAs is questionable. An easy A, but definitely not worth the frustration or busy work she gives you."
131911,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,CHEM113,5.0,4.0,"Most helpful advisor I have every met. She will ensure that you go places in this tough world. She gives you tough love: Learn to deal with it. She is the most candid person I have ever met, she won't supply you with any of the bull that other professors give. She is challenging and rewarding!"
131912,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,CHEM113,5.0,3.0,She was a great professor and incredibly supportive advisor
131913,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"Extremely inpatient, rude,  although she will commit time after class for additional help and she says to ask questions, she makes you feel like a moron for asking a question.  Just seems very unhappy like maybe teaching at a jc is beneath her since she was at Yale.  I simply do not like her!!!"
131914,138944,Iona,Black,Yale University,Science,CHEM119,1.0,1.0,Bad!

131947,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST116,5.0,3.0,"Take her. That's all I need to say, because once you get here you'll know why. 5 star professor. Hands down a history legend."
131948,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST116,5.0,2.0,"A very skilled teacher who structures the course clearly, giving signposts and recaps so students can see where each lecture is headed and how they fit together. She also has an engaging personality and sense of humour. Her in-depth knowledge allows her to introduce fascinating anecdotes and contemporary quotations which bring the period to life."
131949,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIS116,4.0,1.0,"I learned a lot.   That said, Professor Freeman has several stylistic quirks that may have enhanced the lectures for some, but were distracting for me; the most distracting was her frequent enactment of short (1 to 15 second) parodies of the subjects under discussion, followed by a staccato high-pitched (but mercifully, short) laugh.  ( iTunes U)"
131950,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,116,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic lectures, clear, engaging, brilliant. The perfect professor!"
131951,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,116,5.0,4.0,She makes history fun!
131952,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST16,5.0,1.0,Very inspiring
131953,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIS116,5.0,1.0,"One of the most engaging professors I've enountered in my long  life. My only negative comment is that, with the exception of an occasional delightful ad lib, she seems for the most part to be reading a scripted text."
131954,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST116,4.0,1.0,Excellent. Only flaw was Prof. Freeman's frequent somewhat forced laugh.
131955,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST116,5.0,1.0,Interesting Lady!
131956,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST116,5.0,1.0,Nice looking woman
131957,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST116,5.0,1.0,"Doing this class on line and finding Professor Freeman one of the best educators I have had the privilege to learn from. Her enthusiasm, knowledge, passion to her subject is inspiring. I envy the students who witness this class in person."
131958,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIS4,5.0,1.0,I viewed a video clip that she did for a class I am taking.  Very helpful and a clear message was given. I love her laughter.
131959,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST116,4.5,2.0,"accessible, good at teaching, has some kind sense of humor"
131960,747963,Joanne,Freeman,Yale University,History,HIST112,5.0,2.0,"Very clear, accessible, and engaging."
131961,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM134L,3.0,4.0,"General Chemistry Laboratory was honestly way too difficult and time consuming for a half a credit course. It was ridiculous that we did more work for that class than for General Chemistry. In addition, we had a lab report and quiz every single week (the reports were 10 pages long). Your grade in the class depended on the TA you got."
131962,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM116L,1.0,4.0,"shocked to see so many 5.0's, there must be a concerted effort to bring his average up, a mercy he does not extend to the vast majority of his students. Unyielding, rigid, confusing, all of these things make his accessibility outside of class a moot point. Hoping future students can actually enjoy their first chem lab at yale, eventually."
131963,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM116,2.0,3.0,"very judgmental, he thinks that you know everthing but if dont he looks down on you. not understanding if you open up to him he will use that agents you. my high school teachers are better than him"
131964,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM134L,2.0,5.0,Unnecessarily picky grader.
131965,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,134L,1.0,5.0,Rude/harsh grader
131966,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM116L,5.0,3.0,Incredible professor. Can answer every question and makes a boring subject pretty enjoyable!
131967,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM119,4.0,1.0,Easy A if you do a little work.
131968,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM116,5.0,2.0,Excellent professor! Humorous and knows his stuff.
131969,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM116L,5.0,3.0,"I love the way he says, ""can you believe?"""
131970,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,116,4.0,1.0,i love this guy! he is so interested in what he is doing and always willing to help! plus the class is fun and easy minus the loooooong lab hours
131971,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM116L,5.0,2.0,awesome guy.
131972,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,SCI114,5.0,2.0,What an amazing teacher!!!
131973,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM,5.0,2.0,I love this man!
131974,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM114,5.0,2.0,Best Teacher ever.
131975,202334,Narasimhan,Ganapathi,Yale University,Chemistry,SCI114,5.0,2.0,Great Teacher! Really helpful!
131978,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON101,4.0,4.0,great great
131979,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON558,5.0,5.0,"Very difficult, but extremely rewarding class."
131980,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,IDECORE500,5.0,4.0,He is someone that really cares for his students. He teaches in a way that will train you to think like an economist rather than just getting you to memorize concepts - more profs should teach like this - it may make the course more challenging but it is worth it!
131981,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON558,5.0,3.0,"Starts slow to properly build foundations. Then speeds up rapidly. While it takes some time to appreciate this style, if you work hard at the start it pays off!"
131982,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON558,5.0,4.0,Challenges you to actually think - an incredibly rewarding class!
131983,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON558,5.0,4.0,Best advisor I have ever had.
131984,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON558,5.0,4.0,"Very different lecture style. Really gets into detail as this is Master Level. You will have to get used to it but when you do it is more rewarding than any other class I took. Even if it seems easy at first, you need to work to *really* understand it. Be prepared to forget everything you learned at undergraduate as you will have to re-learn it."
131985,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,MICRO507,4.0,3.0,"Brilliant man and an absolute gem of a person. His style of teaching is different and initially not easy to follow, but once I allowed myself to get used to it, I started enjoying his classes. He tries to explain the logic behind the theory which is very valuable. Apart from that, the best adviser I have had till date."
131986,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON545,1.0,3.0,His classes are not well structured and he does not communicate ideas clearly. He is terrible at responding to questions via email and essentially ignores his students.
131987,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON558,5.0,4.0,Difficult to follow in lecture but if you take the time to listen and read you will learn so much!
131988,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON559,1.0,5.0,This professor does a really poor quality work.  Strange that other people have posted poor reviews of him yet they keep getting removed here.
131989,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECON558,4.5,1.0,"Amazing person and amazing teacher. The second part is a lot more controversial than the first. But to be honest, it's not easy to teach econometrics. And he does it as well as anyone could."
131990,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,IDECORE,1.0,4.0,"terrible, terrible teacher"
131991,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,MICRO507,1.0,3.0,"Boozer is a really nice guy and I think he genuinely wants to help his student.  That said he is such a TERRIBLE teacher and somehow manages to make simple things so difficult.  I think this stems from his time at MIT-- brilliant at math, terrible at communicating."
131992,1248370,Michael,Boozer,Yale University,Economics,ECONX,1.0,3.0,He is very boring and makes simple concepts actually hard to understand. He comes late to class and then makes the class stay fifteen minutes late. He never responds to emails and has clear favorites. He is the worst prof I had in the econ dept at Yale!
131994,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSY101,5.0,3.0,"I'm taking a coursera course called Introduction To Psychology and it's professor Bloom who teaches it. He's honestly amazing and makes every concept easier to understand. Amazing lectures, going into a lot of detail. Would 100% take his class if i was in Yale."
131995,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSY101,4.0,3.0,"Very interesting professor on Coursera. On Coursera, his lectures are all via animation and drawings rather than on a camera, which is engaging for me personally. His intro to psychology was very informative for those who know concepts but not in depth. Taking it as a junior in high school on my free time is challenging but what he says sticks."
131996,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,4.5,3.0,Great Lecturer. Learned so much in his class.
131997,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSY101,4.5,3.0,Watched his online lectures. They were interesting and informative. He knows what he is talking about.
131998,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,4.5,1.0,"I'm watching Yale Open Course videos, and so far, he's amazing"
131999,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,4.5,2.0,"His Into to Psychology class is basically the reason I became a psych major. It remains one of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale. Bloom's lectures are engrossing, hilarious, and crystal-clear. Highly recommended!"
132000,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCH101,3.0,3.0,He seems to be very nice from his lectures on youtube. Check them out!!
132001,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,EAR2,4.0,2.0,Awesome
132002,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,3.0,My favorite professor at Yale. Incredible lecturer.
132003,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSY101,1.0,3.0,He is the reason i am transfering to Havard.
132005,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've ever had!  I ended up majoring in psych after taking his intro psych course, and I think he taught me everything I needed to know in the major!"
132008,133932,Paul,Bloom,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCH,3.0,4.0,"A rising star in his field, if considering grad school, pay close attention to his ideas."
132009,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,PLCY2725,1.5,4.0,"Hastings no longer works at Yale, she has moved on to Brown. Here she is, quite possible, the worst Econ professor I have ever encountered. Not only does she not care about your schedule, she also has no interest in your opinion. She wants you to spit out assignments, not learn."
132010,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON114,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, really enjoyed her."
132011,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON114,1.0,3.0,Worst professor I've had in 4 years of college
132012,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECONADV,3.0,3.0,She is my advisor and is getting me a job at Haliburton. Shes ok in my book.
132013,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECO114,3.0,2.0,"she is very mean to students and treat you like you are like a kid. never clear about her subject. if you can, avoid"
132014,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,1.5,5.0,She's rude an uninteresting
132015,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,1.0,5.0,"boring class, she makes you uninterested in subject"
132016,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,1.0,4.0,"she is not clear, she is rude to students, and she has a large ego."
132017,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,5.0,3.0,"I thought this was an excellent class. Unlike other professors who teach Intro Econ, she doesn't try her best to avoid using math. Even if she does talk as if she's addressing 4-year olds, its better than being treated like a 19-year old idiot who can't do any math."
132018,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,1.0,4.0,"Agree with everyone before--she said ""K?"" on an avergae of every five seconds, she was irritating as heck and completely unclear in conveying the basic principles and concepts."
132019,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115A,1.0,5.0,"Destroyed my interest in economics. Proves that maybe the policy isn't right, not all professors should have to teach undergrads. Stay away."
132020,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON114,2.0,3.0,"She tried to do some interesting things with class (movies, etc.), but she wasn't really clear with the material. Also, she would try to be ""cute"" but then would be mean, too...I felt like I was being treated like a 4 year old."
132021,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,1.5,4.0,"Agreed with first rater. Hastings is unenthusiastic, antagonistic, and treats college students like children! Avoid if possible!"
132022,270726,Justine,Hastings,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,1.0,3.0,What a joke. She teaches like it's a kindergarten class.
132023,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,PHIL101,4.5,3.0,"I have learned so much from Maestro Hahm. His conducting is elegant, exciting, and refined. Rehearsals are engaging, and he gives great insights into the pieces. I felt very comfortable under his baton and the Philharmonia gave great concerts with him as our conductor."
132024,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,ORCH101,5.0,2.0,"Shinik Hahm is a great conductor. Every rehearsal was engaging. Also respects orchestra members time, gets work done, and schedules his rehearsals to make people as happy as possible. Rite of Spring in September was completely sold out, and the audience went nuts at the end. One of the best orchestra experiences ever for me--thanks Maestro!!"
132025,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,ORCH101,5.0,3.0,"Maestro Hahm is a dedicated, and clear conductor. He brings so much more to the music than what is on the page, and even though he expects the musicians to give 100%, he always makes them feel a part of a collective group, and gives them praise when they do well. I have learned so much from him, and look forward to more semesters of orchestra!"
132026,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,PHIL101,3.5,1.0,"Shinik is a polite and friendly professional. Yes, his English could use some work, and many of his interpretations are somewhat atypical or suspicious, but if you show up to rehearsal and play well you'll have no problems. He has only ever said encouraging and friendly things to me, and I respect his musicianship (if a bit strange sometimes)."
132027,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,ORCH101,2.0,4.0,I can only say this: I have learnt nothing from him. He is the kind of conductor who thinks needs to be rude in order to get the students' respect. There is no good class preparation and all he does is yelling at the students. I can't believe this gentleman s teaching in a place like Yale.
132028,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,ORCH101,1.0,3.0,"The single worst faculty member at the Yale School of music.  He should have been fired years ago.  Why an otherwise great school keeps him on faculty, I have no idea.  Ridiculous."
132029,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,PHIL1,1.0,5.0,"Terrible. I've been turned off orchestral playing all together because of him. He disrespects students, his English skills are unacceptable and incoherent, and he has almost no musical connection. Worst conductor I've ever played with."
132030,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,MUSORCH,1.0,3.0,"From him I learned how to hate orchestra.  He runs a group of world dedicated graduate students like its grade school with on-the-spot ""seating audition"" solos, singling out individuals in what is supposed to be a group sport.  I find it hard to believe that in a place as amazing as Yale, there can be someone who so disrespects our time and efforts"
132031,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,MUHL401,1.5,4.0,"Hahm looks competent when he conducts, but there is a total disconnect between his conducting and the music...as though he rehearses to recordings.  His rehearsals are generally a waste of time."
132032,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,MUS642,5.0,4.0,"Shinik Hahm's leadership is outstanding: he has a vision for the orchestra, and he works hard to realize that vision.  He always has the best interests of the players at heart. He expects professionalism in rehearsals and performances."
132033,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,PHIL0,1.0,5.0,"Where do I begin? I've never seen a worse teacher, nor any so full of hot air and self importance. He seems to operate in a completely other world from the students he purports to mentor. Yale has let themselves down terribly."
132034,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,PHILHAR,1.0,3.0,"One classic rehearsal was when he poorly mismanaged the time needed and told the students, ""We're going to hold rehearsal 10 minutes longer, you guys don't have a union, it is okay, I don't like unions, and I'll cut rehearsal tomorrow 10 minutes short.""  What he did not realize is that there was no rehearsal scheduled the next day."
132035,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,MUS542,5.0,4.0,Shinik Hahm is one of the hardest working professors at Yale School of Music.  His connection to the entire student body is unmatched by almost anyone else at YSM. He inspires not only with his incredible gregariousness but also by his great expressiveness in concerts.  His extreme dedication to the orchestra is unquestionable. A great conductor!
132036,961552,Shinik,Hahm,Yale University,Music,VIOLIN,1.0,5.0,I agree with the prior postings.  There has been an overwhelmingly bad response from not just one person but the entire student body (and some faculty) in regard to Hahm.  He is an ignorant neophyte and a bad musician.  Couldn't Yale do better than him?
132037,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC180,4.5,2.0,"Super easy class and no busy work.  Had to do a book review, read another book, two exams and a facebook assignment.  The Professor is laid back (maybe cause it's summer?), but the class was easy and interesting."
132038,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGYS110,4.5,2.0,He's a good professor and made our 3 hour classes entertaining and useful.  I recommend his Intro class for any future students who have interest in psychology.
132039,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGY110,3.5,4.0,I just finish summer school with Dr Kelmanski.  He is fast talker and good advisor.  It was honorful to take class at Yale.
132040,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCH18001,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Klemanski is a nice guy, good teacher, and smart in psychology.  I had heard great things about his summer course that was smaller but this larger course did not disappoint.  His TAs weren't the easiest graders, but his tests wer fair and predictable based on the study guides."
132041,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSY180,4.5,4.0,"I really enjoyed Professor Klemanski's class! I hope he teaches more classes so I can take them.  Tests are fair, assignments are definitely manageable, and he's a really good teacher!  He cares more about learning than harsh grades and it totally helped me!"
132042,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,3.0,"He is the coolest, most friendliest person I've ever met. I had him over the summer and he was like a friend more than a professor, he always was down to earth and even wrote me a stellar recommendation letter. Definitely recommend him to everyone, you will not regret it"
132043,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGY180,4.5,2.0,"Solid teacher.  Talks fast, but understandable.  His tests are hard-ish, but he gives extra credit to compensate.  If you take the class, you should do fairly well."
132044,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSY180,5.0,3.0,"Awesome class and nicest professor I've ever meet.  He's the best professor at Yale, no doubt!! Except he talks too fast!  He gives you his slides, so you get to pay attention to the topics.  He gives a lot of extra credit.  Take his class. Loved it!"
132045,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSY180,5.0,3.0,"I really liked this class.  Professor Klemanski was a good teacher and really cared about us students. He's one of the top Yale College professors, IMO."
132046,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSY180,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! Funny, super-smart, nice, and good with students.  I also think he's cute, but that's not why I recommend him. Best professor at Yale!"
132047,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC180,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors at Yale.  Hands down.  He works with you.  Talks super fast, but gives you all his notes."
132048,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC180,5.0,2.0,"He's really into attendance, like really into attendance (absurd for 200+ kids), but is one of the most devoted and earnest professors at yale."
132049,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,4.5,1.0,"Very helpful professor. Easy to pass his tests, lenient about scoring as well."
132050,1745448,David,Klemanski,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,4.5,3.0,Chill professor.  Take his class.
132052,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,4.0,2.0,Great lecturer! Really fun and interesting! Wow!
132053,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,3.5,3.0,Enjoyed his lectures. Interesting personality.
132054,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,4.5,2.0,wonderful
132055,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,COGSCI110,4.0,4.0,Great lecturer. Engaging and interesting.
132056,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,4.5,3.0,He was one of my favorite professors I've had at Yale!
132057,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,3.5,2.0,"Professor Scholl was a well-organized professor, and he knew what he wanted to discuss in each class.  His manner of testing, and the large size of his class, however, prevented him from being a truly excellent lecturer."
132058,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,4.5,3.0,"Professor Scholl is one of the best teachers I've ever had- even in a big lecture he is funny, clear, and engaging. He posts lecture notes online before class and is willing to answer questions after class or during office hours. Professor Scholl is a fabulous teacher."
132059,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,5.0,3.0,Awesome lecturer
132060,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,CGSC110,5.0,3.0,BEST PROFESSOR EVER
132061,63747,Brian,Scholl,Yale University,Psychology,COGSCI110,3.5,3.0,great lecturer!  would put notes on-line before each lecture - soo helpful :)  clear explainations
132066,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,CLCV205,4.0,3.0,Much respected teacher.  I highly recommend!
132067,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,CLCV205,5.0,4.0,Kagan rocks my world!
132068,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,WAR101,5.0,5.0,Amazing
132069,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,CLCV205,5.0,4.0,"Adjectives: graceful, gentlemanly, fascinating, erudite. You can tell I am a fan, but really, he is the best lecturer I have seen. Sitting in his lectures is a delight. It's better than the history channel in presentation, and from a very nice gentleman."
132070,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,CLCV205,5.0,4.0,"Professor Donald Kagan is brilliant, compassionate, and knowledgable beyond a doubt. His courses may or may not change your life, but he will certainly change the way you appraoch history."
132071,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,HIST405,5.0,5.0,"Soooo smart and inteligent and capable of answering every single question. It is not that he knows about Greece only, he makes various other references as well. Seminars I took with him have been the most prescious moments of my education at Yale. I wish he still teaches his Origins of War, but chances are slim. He has taught me a lot!"
132072,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,HISTWARANGR,5.0,4.0,I had this gentleman during the summers of 1971 and 1973 at Cornell. I didn't know what a good prof was until I met him.
132073,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,ANCGRKHIST,5.0,3.0,"I still remember the final lecture of his Ancient Greek History course, 9 years ago."
132074,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,HST370,4.0,4.0,"He's pretty damned good, I must say."
132075,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,HIST205,5.0,3.0,The best professor at Yale.
132076,135916,Donald,Kagan,Yale University,History,HIST205,5.0,4.0,Best lecturer at Yale.
132080,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUS112,5.0,2.0,"He is able to explain everything in very simple terms and he is able to relate music knowledge to other forms of art in the same period, making the music itself making more sense."
132081,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,HIST101,5.0,3.0,"I never expected his online class, Introduction to Classical Music, to be this good! His lectures are very well-organized and so interesting. Better than any classroom music course I've ever taken. Don't hesitate to enroll. I wish he had more online classes."
132082,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSI112,4.5,3.0,"Despite having degrees in dental surgery and archaeology, I've never enjoyed a course as much as this one. The lecturer, from beginning to end, maintained my level of interest, stimulation and the feeling of having learnt something of great value. Thank you Yale."
132083,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSIC112,5.0,1.0,Great teacher
132084,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,HIST101,4.5,2.0,Do you guys have this professor's email address?
132085,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSI112,3.5,1.0,fun class -- but i heard its hard if u dont have any music background... still interesting to hear and learn about diff types of music
132086,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUS001,1.5,3.0,"Professor Wright can be interesting, but he is unfortunately also very inconsistent and rigid in his ideas. He will take points off on essays on things which he believes might be wrong, but are actually correct . He may also assign readings and then decide, after many students have already done the work, that he does not want that assignment done."
132087,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSIS120,4.0,3.0,"Good lecturer, a nice guy. Essays seemed to be graded more on grammar and other minutia than actual content."
132088,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSIC112,5.0,3.0,"Well prepared.  Good lecturer.  Class a gut only if you have good ears; if not, it's can be hard."
132090,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSI112,5.0,1.0,"Great class, but yes, actually, a gut."
132091,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSIC112,4.5,3.0,"Listening to Music was a good class, but not a great class.  Although you are not required to know anything about music to take this class...being able to read music helps...a lot!"
132092,138941,Craig,Wright,Yale University,Music,MUSI112A,5.0,3.0,"listening to music--AMAZING class, not a gut."
132094,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENG400,5.0,5.0,I took a class from professor Bloom about 5 years ago. professor bloom knows a lot and can give a great lecture. I thought to myself all this material is free at the public library/ the public internet/web.  Paper /Pencil. Internet /web. what I wanted was to be a great writer or creative writing. Pencil /Paper. Internet /web /facebook. All we need.
132095,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,HUMS222,4.0,2.0,"He is incredibly knowledgeable and experienced in his field, and students can hear some great thoughts and interpretations on pieces. However, he does tend to get off subject; sometimes for 10 minutes, sometimes for 30. Either way, you still get great knowledge about the subject. Being graded only on the term paper is a great thing too."
132096,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,HUMS101,4.5,4.0,"An incredible lecturer, and wonderful one on one if you have any questions concerning the final paper or anything under the poetic sun. Each lecture more interesting than the last -- Prof. Bloom can recite much of the poems and plays covered by heart, and has dedicated his life to teaching them in his own distinct (but great) way."
132097,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,LIT501,1.0,1.0,bloom cannot stand the fact that he will never be as good of a writer as nietzsche was
132098,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENG501,2.5,3.0,"Just remember that Mr. Bloom's favorite poem in ""When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard BLOOMED"" and his favorite novel is about a man named Leopold BLOOM. That tells you all  you need to know about this man's ego."
132099,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENGLI400,5.0,1.0,"The unthinkingness of school makes his class look absurd. You have to read to understand him, and school generally precludes reading with busywork. The implication is, if one wants to be the greatest student he ever had, one has to have no priorities other than literature. Flunk out of Yale first, then go to his class."
132100,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ALLATNYU,4.0,5.0,"He is a bear. He roars and challenges. ""Squeeze lemon and throw out pulp if you disagree with me."" He knows that he is a literary star so he doesn't hide fact you should respect him. He loves literature and examining man and God and Freud. He does want us to learn how to see things through a different lense. Suprisingly warm and supportive one/one"
132101,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENG354,2.0,4.0,That blurb about his being able to read one thousand pages an hour is such a sham.
132102,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,BLOOM101,3.0,3.0,"Interesting forum for learning about Harold Bloom, Harold Bloom's thoughts on poetry, Harold Bloom's version of psychoanalysis, Harold Bloom's view of Shakespeare, and Harold Bloom as a Christ-figure in literary criticism.  Not a Bloom-free moment here!"
132103,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENG,5.0,5.0,"Talk about MAN unlimited.  Where shall wisdom be found?  Right here.  I used to like T.S. Eliot, but then Dr. Bloom showed me how ignorant I was.  But that's OK.  His influence causes no anxiety here."
132104,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENGLISH,2.0,5.0,"He'll like your work or hate your work, so be careful.  Very unpredictable and a huge ego."
132105,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENGL,5.0,1.0,Bloom is da bomb
132106,226583,Harold,Bloom,Yale University,English,ENG400,3.0,3.0,His seminar is an experience more than a class.  It's intense and relatively easy if you remember to agree with him.  Worth taking just to be in the presence of such a large intellect (and ego)
132107,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,AGRI495,5.0,2.0,"Rutgers 11:373:495 Iss. in Agri. is Wine Economics course, also  counts toward lower level for Econ-220. Significantly intense and quite a bit study material, but Prof. Storchman good + humor made it interesting and easy to follow. A great Opportunity for research and learn about an actual industry from an authority on this subject. Great Course"
132108,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON110,5.0,2.0,Karl is the best! I always looked forward to going to his class.
132109,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON110,5.0,1.0,"Storchman taught 110, that is, small micro sections instead of the huge lecture class. Great experience. I learned a lot. I wish I took more class from him"
132110,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON227,5.0,2.0,I took urban economics with Karl. I thought this was wonderful class. Lots of intricate theory. But he makes it come alive. I also like that he uses video clips at times
132111,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON311,5.0,5.0,I think Storchmann is the best. incredibly funny an interesting. He really knows his stuff. Storchmann rocks!
132112,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON110,5.0,4.0,"I have no idea why people rate Professor Storchmann now. There seems to be somebody who doesnt like Professor Storchmann, Storchmann left Yale in 2005. In any event. I took three classes with him. He is the best teacher I have ever had."
132113,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON1,5.0,3.0,Storchmann rocks!
132114,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON422,1.0,5.0,Its not so much that he was a poor communicator but that he had no idea as to what he wanted to teach. He would come to class unprepared and ramble off the top of his head. Learned nothing-stressed every test and HW.
132115,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECONDEPT,1.0,5.0,A miserable experience through and through. He thinks he can come into class and contradict the textbook and lecture of the top of his head. A professor who does no preparation and no work for the class is no professor at all.
132116,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,UECON,1.0,5.0,"Horrible professor, no surprise he is gone. I have never seen such an inability to teach in life. One question: Why is he a professor?"
132117,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,URBAN200,1.0,5.0,"Completley arbitrary grading, worthless proffesor."
132118,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON110,3.5,2.0,"Storchman is the best. Loved him. A bit hard to understand at first, but you get used to him and he's never boring. You'll see him riding his bike around campus all the time."
132119,452117,Karl,Storchmann,Yale University,Economics,ECON115,3.5,2.0,"First off, you get no advantage from taking the seminar; take the lecture. The class is a bit high-schoolish, and you don't really need to show up to learn the material. Storchmann at least tries to infuse humor into stuff that gets otherwise pretty dry."
132120,73400,Timothy,Robinson,Yale University,English,ENGL114,4.5,2.0,"He is a really awesome professor. He is funny, quirky, helpful, and always kind. You can go to him with anything. I learned so much in his class. Must take. He will be my adviser next year!"
132122,73400,Timothy,Robinson,Yale University,English,ENGL129,5.0,3.0,"Very funny, personable, and willing to provide extra help when needed. Loves to hear students' interpretations and discuss various opinions. Makes English interesting and fun! :)"
132123,73400,Timothy,Robinson,Yale University,English,ENG129,5.0,3.0,"I love this professor!!! If you are thinking of a ENG 129 section, take his class! I shopped 5 different sections and I fell in love with him. Like, really. He's the most funniest, interesting-est person ever. Great teacher."
132124,73400,Timothy,Robinson,Yale University,English,ENGL129,4.0,2.0,Professor Robinson has made me want to major in English.
132125,73400,Timothy,Robinson,Yale University,English,ENGL129,5.0,3.0,"Funny, quirky, very intelligent"
132126,73400,Timothy,Robinson,Yale University,English,ENGL129,3.0,3.0,"Professor Robinson has many characteristics of a good teacher, but he falls short of being truly great. He encourages students to talk but interjects his own ideas before they're done, tries to bring humor to the class but is not very funny, etc. On the whole he's a very good, not great, teacher."
132127,73400,Timothy,Robinson,Yale University,English,ENG129,5.0,3.0,"Professor Robinson was such a great English professor!  He includes humor with wisdom, fair grading with challenge, and fun with work.  Thanks, Professor, for starting my college English career so enjoyably!"
132131,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENG201,5.0,1.0,He is one of the best teachers I have ever had and he makes reading Shakespeare fun along with his absolutely deep and sound discussion knowledge.  He can make us discuss on anything.
132132,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENG001,5.0,3.0,"I found him to be one of the warmest, most helpful teachers I've ever had.  Beyond that, his depth and breadth of knowledge is staggering, the discussion in his classes was always incredible.  I took 3 classes with him because I was never bored in his classroom.  I gradated 12 years ago and I still remember things I learned from him."
132133,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENG495,5.0,3.0,"Took Victorian Poetry with Brisman and really learned how to read poems.  He is such a careful reader and is a MASTER of leading discussions. He has a scary exterior and is VERY vocal about his politics, so watch out if you disagree with him.  But it didn't get in the way of the coursework, which all in all was a great experience."
132134,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENGL250,4.0,5.0,Professor Brisman is a great teacher.
132135,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENGL100,4.0,2.0,"I respond to the criticisms of Brisman from 6/1/11. I served as a teaching assistant with Brissman as did my wife. He was a heroic teacher. We read each paper together, conferred about the student successes/failures, and gave extensive comments. I cannot speak the previous students experience of shame, I learned from a brilliant caring prof."
132136,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENG700,1.5,3.0,"Took a class from him 33 years ago, one of the worst experiences I ever had, although I got a good grade. I hope that he has learned to be a better teacher. He shamed people in class and in comments on papers, with snide and even cruel remarks. He was the reason I dropped out of grad school. And not only me. Half the class dropped out that year."
132137,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENG250,5.0,3.0,"Professor Brisman changed my life, my attitude toward literature, and the course of my career. Can you say that about other teachers? What an amazing, wonderful person."
132138,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENGL250,2.5,4.0,He made me hate a subject I loved.
132139,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENGL220,5.0,3.0,"Great professor who gives advice on all matters, from problems in other classes to social life."
132140,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,ENGL125200,5.0,3.0,"An amazing, insightful, and warm teacher. Don't be fooled by his somewhat scary exterior; he's one of the best teachers at Yale."
132141,672895,Leslie,Brisman,Yale University,English,BIBLEASLIT,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Brisman made the Bible come alive with his enthusiasm. He is fair, warm, and brings very interesting analysis to the text, paying special attention to the particular voices of the writers of the Bible. The class is fascinating, and the teacher is a jem and a sage."
132142,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS110501,4.0,4.0,"She certainly cares about the Persian language and wants her students to learn. She pushes us to improve and continuously raises the bar for our performance. I've learned a lot, but I've also been discouraged by her interpersonal style. At times, she has shamed and rebuked students in front of the class, making the classroom environment stressful."
132143,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,150,5.0,3.0,"I took Persian earlier and found out I was way behind when I started at Yale, but Professor Shayesteh was great about helping me catch up and I learned a lot. You have to go to class and keep up. The Persian she taught me is a huge help now in grad school. Take her course. You wont be sorry! Shes the greatest!"
132144,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS150151,5.0,3.0,Recommend! Your Persian will improve a lot and you'll enjoy getting to know Persian literature through short storiesreadings.  You'll also write often and receive careful feedback. L5 is definitely the best of all Persian courses because it is less about grammar and more about engaging readings (almost a reward for L1-L4 hard work) which is fun!
132145,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,501,3.5,4.0,"This is an intensive language course; however, by the end of the semester you'll realize that you've learned a lot in terms of writing a 3-page long if you were graduate student. Be prepared to attend a mandatory language table on Sundays with our great TA, for 20 minutes or so. You'll learn about the Iranian culture which makes you eager to visit."
132146,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS110,5.0,3.0,"She has high standards and will push you to learn as much as possible. Be prepared to put in enough time for homework, and you'll get a lot out of the class. "
132147,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERSIAN110,4.0,4.0,"Professor Shayesteh was great as an L1 language professor. Students, in a single semester, learn to write several pages of Farsi; to engage in basic conversation; and to read short dialogues. Throughout the class, Iranian culture was taught with the grammar. Though tough, Shayesteh is clear in her expecatations and great at explaining the language."
132148,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS110,4.5,4.0,"I would highly recommend this course! The class is definitely a lot of work, but you will be amazed by the amount of Persian you'll know at the end of one semester. If you're interested in actually learning a language, take this course!"
132149,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS110,4.5,3.0,"PERS 110 with Dr. Shayesteh was much more helpful than I thought it'd be. By the end of the course, I was able to read and write very well and could even carry on a conversation with a native speaker. Just like any language course, you get as much as you give in terms of time and effort. Dr. Shayesteh is easily the best language professor I've had."
132150,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS501,5.0,1.0,"This course was critical to my progress in Farsi. I am a native Farsi speaker but had no experience in reading, writing, and formal speaking. Prof. Shayesteh provided a robust foundation in all of these facets and I can now write 4 page essays in Persian at the end of one semester. This is an excellent course for those who work hard. "
132151,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS501,5.0,2.0,"She is there if you need her, quick to respond to emails, the TA's are also available and approachable.   Sometimes with the content it can get confusing and there's a lot thrown at you but as long as you are patient it's not the end of the world.   Not easy, but worth it if you are serious about learning. "
132152,1795639,Farkhondeh,Shayesteh,Yale University,Near Eastern Studies,PERS130,4.5,2.0,"This was my second Persian course, and was much better than my first. Some students thought it was a hard class, but they weren't ready (I think their prof wasn't very good). If you keep up with the class and do the optional homework, it isn't had to do well and the professor is pretty helpful.  Regular attendance helps a lot and it's required."
132153,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HIST0000,1.5,4.0,"Words cannot describe how pompous, pretentious, and arrogant this man is. He is so malicious and cruel that I think he has a psychological problem. Beware this prof and his power trips."
132154,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HIST000,5.0,4.0,he's amazing; he incorporates art and literature into the history course and keeps everything interesting
132155,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HIST000,5.0,3.0,very well prepared for class and a great lecturer
132156,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HIST,1.0,2.0,"Arrogant, crude, obnoxious, condescending.  That about says it all."
132157,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HIST,1.0,3.0,"he plays favorites. you can write a horrible paper and get an A if he likes you. he doesn't even bother to read papers, just grades based on his opinion of you.  gives nothing in the way of written feedback, unless he's interested in trashing you. Avoid!  if you like sucking up and kissing ass, take this class.  otherwise, don't."
132158,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HIST,2.0,2.0,"He's a nasty jerk.  He plays favorites.  If he likes you, you're golden.  If you're not one of his pets, you will be held to a different standard.  He's just a jerky, immature turd.  He's a very hostile, angry person.  He takes his anger out on students  who can't fight back and who have never done anything wrong to him.  Wish I'd never taken this."
132159,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HIST120,5.0,5.0,Best class I've ever taken!
132160,163811,John,Faragher,Yale University,History,HST120,1.0,5.0,Worst class I have ever taken...stay away.
132164,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,PLSC000,5.0,4.0,David Cameron is hands down one of the very best professors I have encountered at Yale. He is very experienced and gives clear feedback. Took two classes with him and would recommend his classes to anyone who wants to learn!
132165,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,PLSC366,5.0,3.0,"Really superb professor. He has an unbelievable amount of experience in this field and has a lot to share, though he still leaves much room for class engagement. He makes sure to utilize everyone's strengths and experience for the betterment of class discussion as a whole."
132166,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,POLISCI101,1.5,5.0,sucked.  4 people got a grade higher than a C.
132167,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,POLI,3.0,2.0,"Good lecturer, passionate about his subject. Learned a great deal from the class and became more interested in the subject matter, though his style is a bit dry. Would recommend to others."
132168,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,PLSC000,5.0,1.0,Excellent professor.
132169,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,PLSC366,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, passionate about what he teaches, extremely accessible to students, and extraordinarily knowledgeable."
132170,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,POLYSCI,1.0,5.0,One word says it all...  Horrible.
132171,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,PS,1.0,5.0,"Very unclear, did not appreciate student contact at all; except for some of the girls..."
132172,224278,David,Cameron,Yale University,Political Science,PLSC166B,3.5,3.0,Had a tendency to repeat the same thing over and over again with transparencies galore.
132173,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,HUMS411,3.5,4.0,"Charlie Hill is a great prof, and there's a lot to learn in his class. A lot of students get confused because he is very familiar with the Western Canon and foreign events, and if you're inexperienced on either (or you don't do your reading) you may not understand his references. But he's very approachable in office hours, and willing to help!"
132174,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,IR101,3.5,3.0,Great intro IR class if you are interested in a moderate viewpoint on US relations with the international community. He also adds great anecdotes from his prior experience in politics.
132175,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,INST292,3.0,2.0,"Mr. Hill (not ""Prof.""- he doesn't have a PHD) is a very likable man, but it bothered me that he said things in class (and also in panels) that were factually untrue.  Even though he's not very outgoing, there is a cult-like idol worship of him among many undergrads.  His writing assignments were fun and challenging."
132176,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,INTS110,1.5,3.0,"I was really excited for the course, and Prof. Hill's first lecture made me believe that it would be a great lecture, but his enthusiasm and clarity both waned after the first week. By October, I was falling asleep every class. The exams were quote IDs from over 1,000 pages of readings! Interesting man, but not a great professor"
132177,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,INTS102,1.0,1.0,"Hill was once perhaps a very competent foreign service officer.  He clearly knows how to BS, which is what he tries to do with his classes.  I've often watched incredulously as he answers a student question like he would answer a question at a press conference- try to sound smart without saying anything at all.  Hear he's great in seminar, though."
132178,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,DRST01,4.5,4.0,"Great class, great Prof.  One of Yale's most lauded, and rightly so."
132180,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,INST101,1.5,2.0,"I took Charlie's International Ideas and Institutions class first semester (it's now been renumbered). It was nothing but a biweekly master's tea, as he used it as an excuse to talk about his time spent in the state department- he forgot to teach. Take the Poli Sci course on International Relations."
132181,326935,Charles,Hill,Yale University,International Studies,INTS101,5.0,3.0,"Great class!! Prof. Hill is brilliant (although very conservative). Little reading, interesting lectures, and some of class time is spent going over current events having question/answer sessions. Very straightforward lecturer."
132182,330226,Richard,Deming,Yale University,English,ENG120,5.0,3.0,"an amazing teacher. will make you a better writer, a better thinker. his assignments also make you grapple with what's important in your life. don't take this class unless you're ready to think about who you really are."
132183,330226,Richard,Deming,Yale University,English,ENGL127,5.0,5.0,"The best professor I've ever had. He reminded me why I love to read, opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about poetry, and helped me develop more as a writer and thinker than any teacher I've had. He's not easy, but to not take anything he offers is a huge mistake."
132184,330226,Richard,Deming,Yale University,English,ENGL216,4.5,4.0,"Deming is amazing, and incredibly helpful. Really knows how to help improve your writing without altering your style."
132185,330226,Richard,Deming,Yale University,English,ENG120,2.5,4.0,This professor doesn't teach well
132186,330226,Richard,Deming,Yale University,English,ENG120,1.0,5.0,"agreed w/ another commenter, a very unclear, irrational, and at times downright invasive and uncomfortable professor. english 120 had so much potential, and i sorely regret having been assigned him as my professor."
132187,330226,Richard,Deming,Yale University,English,ENGL120,2.5,5.0,Do NOT take English 120 with this professor. He is too picky with essays and gives unhelpful comments. I hate his class and regret being placed in his section.
132188,330226,Richard,Deming,Yale University,English,ENG127,4.0,3.0,He's a great instructor. Class discussions will always be lively.
132191,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ANTH234E,2.5,2.0,"He's a good teacher, he's kind of a geek about the material which is a good thing, he talks about the topic like he is talking about his comic book collection. I would recommend."
132192,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ANTH172,1.0,3.0,Professor Canuto could learn the virtues of a courtesy flush.
132193,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,SEVERAL,5.0,3.0,I would disagree with all of the poor evaluations of Marcello. He is a brillant and amicable professor who is an undisputed leader in his field.
132194,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ANTH,1.0,4.0,Not too interesting.  Below par.
132195,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ARCH232,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Canuto is helpful, hard-working and endlessly knowledgable about his subject.  But he didn't talk to our class about Star Trek, that would have been good.  But having done a very intensive course with Prof. Canuto, it was a really good experience, and he is an excellent teacher."
132196,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ANTH172,4.0,1.0,"Canuto is not the brightest card in the deck (i.e. went to Harvard but has NO knowledge of science whatsoever).  Fortunately, he teaches archaeology.  He DOES easily get off topic, and I swear most of his lectures are taken directly from Google searches 15 minutes before class...but he's not bad."
132197,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ANTH,2.0,3.0,"Gets off the subject very easily, personal political commentary is not welcome."
132198,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ANTHR,1.0,4.0,Prof. Canuto should spend less time talking about Star Trek and more about the topics in the text books.
132199,429803,Marcello,Canuto,Yale University,Anthropology,ARCH,1.5,3.0,Very disorganized and sweats a lot.  Needs more experience.
132200,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC10,5.0,2.0,Marvin Chun: one of the best professors I've ever had. There's a reason why Sam Tsui sang about him :D
132201,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,1.0,You know you're awesome when Sam Tsui sings about you. Take him!
132202,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,3.0,"Marvin Chun is amazing!  His class was my favorite and all of the lectures were interesting yet vastly different.  He has lunch with students, gives candy at Halloween, and is adorable."
132203,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,2.0,"He is funny and knowledgeable, makes you stay interested in the lecture. It's Marvin Chun who makes Psyc 110 a phenomenal class."
132204,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,2.0,"He's phenomenal - funny, knowledgeable, friendly, dynamic, and the list goes on. When he comes back, take his class!"
132205,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,INTROPSYC,5.0,3.0,"Excellent. He's taking some time off this semester, but his intro psyc is a must take class."
132206,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,3.0,"BRILLIANT! a great professor, clear lecturer, funny,  and considerate of his students."
132208,517640,Marvin,Chun,Yale University,Psychology,INTROPSYCH,4.5,3.0,Chun is usually VERY clear in lecture.  His midterms can be tricky because he includes some very detailed questions.  The course covers a wide range of topics and your knowledge of them is expected to be deeper than his lecture treatments.  Read the book carefully.  Very very funny in lecture.
132209,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,LAW0000,1.0,3.0,"He's a nice person I'm sure but not a good teacher. Tends to talk more about himself than about the subject, constantly off on tangents, very defensive if questioned and cannot handle being disagreed with. I hear he's better with the undergrads. Read his book, skip the class."
132210,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,PLSC230,3.5,5.0,"Good lecturer and very approachable. You will be getting his opinion, but he doesn't grade your papers, so don't worry about agreeing with him. My TA was haute :) Make sure you find a good one."
132211,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,LAW0000,5.0,5.0,Took ConLaw with him as an undergrad- LOVE!
132212,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,DEVN110,1.0,4.0,Awful class.  Amar is a little too full of himself to make this an enjoyable experience.  He is incredibly smart and spends the entire class trying to show that to you.  Way better classes available at Yale
132213,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,PLSC233,4.0,5.0,Con Law was an amazing class that I really enjoyed. Sometime lectures were a bit hard to follow in that he speaks very quickly. Section for this class was very helpful.
132214,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,CONLAW,5.0,3.0,"you are getting his view, but it’s a good one and you learn a ton."
132215,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,CONLAW,1.0,1.0,A horrible teacher. Avoid at all costs.
132216,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,PLSC233,5.0,3.0,awesome!
132217,712391,Akhil,Amar,Yale University,Law,CONLAW,4.0,3.0,"One of the best classes at Yale. Amar is a great lecturer, but he goes on tangents realllly easily so take good notes! And also find a good TA."
132218,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,REL547,4.5,3.0,Jesus &amp; Paul on Poverty and Economic Justice was absolutely phenomenal.  The direction of the course and the access to actually apply the topics covered are elements that made this class experience truly special.  Diana worked so compassionately to teach and reveal depth on God's economy and its relation to us in a present context. Just wonderful.
132219,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,REL547,5.0,3.0,"Diana is a gifted teacher; likely one of the best of my education career. She legitimately cares for the students and for the material and invests all of herself in her teaching for all the right reasons--to help her students grow and to effect change in our world. She is a tremendous interpreter of the Scriptures, as well."
132220,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,REL547,5.0,4.0,"She is one of the most gifted professors that I have ever encountered. While Biblical Studies isn't my favorite subject, her lectures and discussion leadership made the topic fascinating, and she always ties the material back to real world social justice issues. She is an exceptional mentor who truly cares about her students' academic growth."
132221,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,REL501,5.0,5.0,"I have taken three classes from Professor Swancutt.  She is the best professor I have ever encountered.  Her subject area knowledge is unsurpassed and her passion for the material is contagious.  She deeply cares for her students and their hearts, minds, and souls.  She puts an incredible amount of energy into her classes, as well as her students."
132222,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,RELI547,5.0,3.0,"Professor Swancutt is one of the best professors I have encountered during my academic career. She is extremely knowledgable about the material, passionate about it, and deeply cares for every one of her students. Her intellect and energy is contagious and being in her classes inspires you to be a better student and citizen in the world."
132223,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,REL547,4.5,2.0,Jesus &amp; Paul on Poverty and Economic Justice was life-changing.  Professor Swancutt is a passionate and compelling speaker who encouraged discussion throughout our seminar.  Her extensive knowledge of the New Testament complemented the study we did of modern poverty.  This is what I came to seminary for.  I will be forever grateful.
132224,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,REL571,5.0,3.0,"This class was relevant and incredibly enlightening! Swancutt is highly skilled at facilitating informative conversations in a room packed with students who have diverse interests. She treats students as producers and not passive recipients of knowledge. She learns with us. I left the class feeling enriched, engaged, and valued!"
132225,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,REL668,5.0,3.0,"Professor Swancutt is brilliant, ethically informed, deeply humane and personable, and provides holistic support for her students. While she teaches ancient materials, she always creatively makes them relevant to modern everyday experience. Teaching, for her, is truly about a transformative encounter between teacher, student, and text!"
132226,900579,Diana,Swancutt,Yale University,Religion,GEND1000,5.0,2.0,"A gifted teacher and brilliant mind, she will have an impact on you."

132229,944760,Tolga,Koker,Yale University,Economics,ECON110,5.0,3.0,"He is truly one of the best at Yale. Especially in terms of introductory courses, he is one of the best professors to have, he cares about your understanding of the material and will help you get there."
132230,944760,Tolga,Koker,Yale University,Economics,ECON108,4.0,4.0,He is REALLY REALLY good.  Higly recommended.
132231,944760,Tolga,Koker,Yale University,Economics,ECON110,5.0,4.0,"Unlike some others, Tolga loves teaching.  Because of him I have decided to major in financial economics."
132232,944760,Tolga,Koker,Yale University,Economics,ECON110,5.0,3.0,One of the best at Yale.  He really knows how to teach.
132233,944760,Tolga,Koker,Yale University,Economics,INTROMACR,5.0,5.0,He is one of the best professors at Yale.  Thanks Tolga!
132234,944760,Tolga,Koker,Yale University,Economics,INTROECON,5.0,4.0,Tolga rocks.  Always willing to help students.  Exremely accessable.  He did not mind helping me online after midnight more than once.  His extra on-line office hours are of great help.

132248,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,ECON252,5.0,4.0,"I'd taken Professor Shiller's Financial Markets MOOC on Coursera. His lectures are extremely interesting and provide a very different perspective from most ""textbook teachers."" Love his general philosophy on finance and teaching."
132249,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,ECON252,3.0,4.0,good scholar not a good professor
132250,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,FINMARKETS251,4.5,2.0,Professor Shiller is very clear-cut and concise about a subject that tends to be a little rough around the edges. I am taking this class through Coursera to earn a certificate and have found the first week to be challenging but rewarding as I have already learned a lot. Take notes during his lectures.
132251,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,YOUT101,4.5,3.0,Found his lectures on YouTube to help with a paper that I was writing for my Econ course and may I just say that his teaching style is very clear and profound. I was very impressed and wish he was my actual teacher. Look up his lecture on central bank independence. I enjoy his quirky personality
132252,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,COURSERA,5.0,2.0,"Professor Shiller teaches at a very good level. He pauses a lot, and is not, in that way very charismatic, but if you pay attention, you will quickly realise he is one of the finest instructors of Financial Markets out there."
132253,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,ECON252,4.5,2.0,This is an academic course as it should be:  Full of ideas that the teacher has developed over a lifetime of careful thought -
132254,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,ECONOMY,4.5,2.0,Shiller is wwell known to those in finance with his case shiller index
132255,1887583,Robert,Shiller,Yale University,Economics,FINMARKETS,5.0,1.0,"Took his Financial Markets on Coursera and found his explanations to be very clear. Although, he does pause quite often it is obvious to even a layman like myself that he is trying really think how best to explain Financial Markets, so everyone can understand. Great and brilliant professor. Take his class if you have a little interest in Finance."
132256,61312,Glenda,Gilmore,Yale University,History,HIST113,5.0,4.0,AMAZING lecturer
132257,61312,Glenda,Gilmore,Yale University,History,HIST001,3.5,2.0,Such a fun course. I was not interested at all in taking the course and it was definitely one of the best experiences I had my freshmen year. Her grading is marvelous.
132258,61312,Glenda,Gilmore,Yale University,History,HST,5.0,5.0,"She speaks almost as beautifully as she writes--and I swear, I don't care how old she is, she's drop-dead gorgeous, too!  My best class ever."
132259,61312,Glenda,Gilmore,Yale University,History,HISTORY,5.0,4.0,Enjoyed her lectures very much.  She's hot...

132265,138946,Mark,Johnson,Yale University,Science,CHEM118,4.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed my work with Dr. Johnson. His class was fun and I really learned a lot. Sometimes it was challenging, but her really did try to make it entertaining"
132266,138946,Mark,Johnson,Yale University,Science,CHEM118A,1.5,4.0,"full of himself, unpleasant. &amp; although he tries hard to make his class entertaining, he fails to make things as clear as they could be."
132267,138946,Mark,Johnson,Yale University,Science,CHEM118,2.0,2.0,"Terrible teacher.  Stuff that made sense to me in AP Chem didn't make sense anymore after he ""explained"" it.  Also really full of himself.  Really bright guy, but has no place teaching undergrads."
132268,138946,Mark,Johnson,Yale University,Science,CHEM118,4.0,4.0,"I would have done a lot better if high school'd prepared me better.  Wish I could take it again to fully appreciate it...then again...maybe not.  Johnson's pretty cool, though he can be a bit of a jerk, too.  Take him at your own risk."
132269,138946,Mark,Johnson,Yale University,Science,CHEM118,5.0,3.0,very cool lecturer... very entertaining. his tests are very conceptual (though he does make sure to cover all the details in class) which is cool.  lots of fun to talk to if you go visit his office hours.  :-P
132271,138946,Mark,Johnson,Yale University,Science,CHEM118A,3.5,4.0,"fun lecturer, hard class, great curve (grade, not body)"
132272,568910,David,Blight,Yale University,History,HIST119,5.0,4.0,This instructor is a  master teacher. You won't find many like him. A treasure.
132273,568910,David,Blight,Yale University,History,HIST119,5.0,2.0,Excellent course presented well by humorous and engaging professor who is  a class act. As a Britisher who attended high school only sometimes it was for me a privilege to have access to this course online. Thanks to Yale for making it available and even more thanks to Professor Blight.
132274,568910,David,Blight,Yale University,History,HIST2F26,4.0,3.0,Professor Blight's Civil War and Reconstruction course was amazing! It changed the way I thought about the millenial event of American history.
132275,568910,David,Blight,Yale University,History,AA,3.5,3.0,"Very interesting, insightful he tells the story."
132276,568910,David,Blight,Yale University,History,HIST119B,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely amazing prof, really good at teaching things and has a wonderfully dry sense of humour... his was the only class that I didn't even skip once, simply because I loved his lectures so much that I couldn't bear to miss one :-P"
132280,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,CHOIR000,5.0,4.0,She is a wonderful person and very inspiring. Very interested in her students and wider music community.
132281,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,CONDCAM,4.5,4.0,"After having studied with her, I now see music from a totally new and more holistic perspective. She is possibly the best teacher I've ever had."
132282,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,MUSC350,3.5,5.0,"I was in Ms. Brooks' choirs at SUNY Stony Brook back in the 80's.  I've been in a lot of choirs, but she was the best conductor I ever had. I learned a lot from her, and she had very high standards. I developed an interest in conducting from her.  She was not a very sympathetic person, but a great teacher nonetheless."
132283,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,CAMERATA,3.5,4.0,"Despite all the posts about Maggie being shallow or unprofessional, we must accept that this woman can conduct.  Very very well.  Her stick technique is crystal clear, and her gestures are inspiring and honest."
132284,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,CONDU601,1.0,1.0,"Her knowledge is very shallow.  Unfortunately, Yale hasn't been successfully getting rid of her even though they were trying.  She does not do her job but leaves them to other conductors and her students.  Her music theory is her weak point.  Knowledge on musicality is lacking as well."
132285,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,MUSICALL,5.0,3.0,"She's intelligent and can hear everything! You will work but you'll come away from it a better musician. An awesome conductor, too!"
132286,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,CONDUCTING,4.5,5.0,Good teacher. She is able to bring music to life!
132287,641360,Maggie,Brooks,Yale University,Music,CHORALCONDUCTI,1.0,1.0,She is probobaly the least professional professional I have ever seen.  Her knowledge on choral conducting is very shallow and she never studies.  She should be fired.
132288,711978,Peggy,Deamer,Yale University,Architecture,ARCH3213,2.5,4.0,"She can be very difficult, impossible to schedule office hours. She is very smart and  reasonably demanding, but sooo curt. Unnecessary, her manner can be hurtful. She is knowledgeable and able to get good project out students in studio though. If only she would relax and go easy on the students, we are here to get an education not a beating..."
132289,711978,Peggy,Deamer,Yale University,Architecture,ARCH713,5.0,3.0,"Peggy is a demanding, but brilliant professor. Extremely erudite, she truly opened my horizons and introduced me to contemporary philosophy and the humanities in a way that left lasting influence."
132290,711978,Peggy,Deamer,Yale University,Architecture,ARCH001A,4.5,3.0,Really amazing.  You just have to get to know her.
132291,711978,Peggy,Deamer,Yale University,Architecture,ARCHTHER,2.0,3.0,did not seem to have very deep grasp of the subject matter
132292,711978,Peggy,Deamer,Yale University,Architecture,MARCH101,1.0,3.0,Her theory positions are lame!
132293,711978,Peggy,Deamer,Yale University,Architecture,GRADSTUDIO,1.5,3.0,This person talks over her own head.
132295,711978,Peggy,Deamer,Yale University,Architecture,ARCH517,4.5,5.0,"Frequently intimidating, she has some damn good things to say, once individual students get comfortable with her curt responces (a function of her no-nonsense attitude towards crits).  Inspiringly perceptive, a credit to her jurys, and the only thing holding her back is Bob (and Joel?)."
132296,894274,John,Geanakoplos,Yale University,Economics,ECON252,2.0,3.0,"Sad, attention seeking academic who seems to feel its necessary to speak about his accomplishments to gain credibility. Non-stop name dropping and citing of his accomplishments just gets old. Not a terrible class, if you can succeed in overlooking his ego and need for self soothing reassurance."
132297,894274,John,Geanakoplos,Yale University,Economics,ECON251,2.0,3.0,"Poor teaching skills, mediocre mathematician, dated syllabus, disorganised lecture, conceited, pompous, pretentious; thinks world revolves around him; no Nobel material--far from it!!  Spends most of his time ""cashing"" the Yale name in financial mkts.  Avoid if possible."
132298,894274,John,Geanakoplos,Yale University,Economics,ECON251,4.0,4.0,I looked at his class from Open Yale Courses. Professor G. is a very high profile teacher. He is pretty clear in his explanation and he is a great source of inspiration. I strongly raccomand his lectures.
132299,894274,John,Geanakoplos,Yale University,Economics,ECON251,1.5,4.0,"Is very poor in explaining the core concepts - does not separate the wheat from the chaff -  is never is clear as to where he is going - or where he is coming from -  Worse, speaks negatively  about his colleagues as if he is the only one who truly understands the subject - will never get the Nobel price he so clearly feels he deserves."

132302,894274,John,Geanakoplos,Yale University,Economics,ECON252,4.5,4.0,Amazing professor. I looked at his class from Open Yale Courses and it is hands down brilliant and engaging.
132305,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,ECONS328,4.0,3.0,A good Prof. that encourages class participation.
132306,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,ECONS328,4.0,4.0,"Pr. R is a knowledgeable and passionate teacher, and he cares about and respects his students. I strongly recommend his class! "
132307,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,ECON476A,4.5,4.0,"The previous comment is  way off base! First, Pr. Ramirez does not teach econ. 454--he teaches econ. 476a. Second, he's a terrific guy who's very knowledgeable about his area and helpful to students."
132308,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,ECO425,1.0,5.0,"Was an okay guy I did learn some stuff from his methods of teaching. Definitely challenged me, which made me be ready."
132309,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,CC476A,5.0,4.0,Prof. R knows his stuff and challenges students to do their best. I highly recommend him.
132310,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,ECON476,4.5,4.0,Prof. is knowledgeable about international finance and encouraged questions. I highly recommend him
132311,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,ECON476,4.5,3.0,Prof. was hard but fair. He's very knowledgeable. I highly recommend the seminar.
132312,1086064,Miguel,Ramirez,Yale University,Economics,ECON476,5.0,4.0,A demanding but fair professor. I really enjoyed and learned a lot from this seminar in international trade and finance.
132314,59196,John,Merriman,Yale University,History,HIST202,4.0,3.0,"Stereotypical ""Absent-minded Professor"" -- knows European history cold, but lectures seem a little like free-association, and a bit disorganized. His disheveled appearence and mannerisms, including what seems to me to be his pretentious use of The French language can be distracting.  His personality is endearing."
132315,59196,John,Merriman,Yale University,History,HISTIBFR,4.5,2.0,"One of the greatest teacher in the world. He is so amazing, nice and interesting at all levels! He is so close to you despite his wonderful career... Go to his class, he will check you at the end!"

132321,135138,Sophia,Gruzdys,Yale University,Architecture,ARPL302,5.0,3.0,"Inspirational teacher, has a superb knowledge of design and creating beautiful spaces. Sophia has a energetic personality and is at times dramatically creative. So if you want to truly enjoy her class, be out there, try to be creative and have an open mind because you'll work well with Sophia. If you're pure logic though then try a different class."
132322,135138,Sophia,Gruzdys,Yale University,Architecture,ARCH803A,2.5,4.0,"Sophia inspired within the class, a profound fascination with the difficult and largely lost art of descriptive and projective geometry. Although she knew the material very well, she was eager to find points withing the students weekly work, to add to that knowledge base. Great program, great course, awesome professor!"
132323,135138,Sophia,Gruzdys,Yale University,Architecture,DES151,4.0,3.0,"Took her des 1 class at nyit. awesome. Sometimes a little confused. Her recomendations on drawings were a little off when it came to crit time. ""makeing our drawings look like cartoons"" But over all she jumpstarts an awesome competetive level amongst class mates. Her enthusiasm is evident in every class. Does not take tardines very well b on time"
132324,135138,Sophia,Gruzdys,Yale University,Architecture,ARCH160,1.0,2.0,Astonishingly opaque. Does she understand herself?
132325,135138,Sophia,Gruzdys,Yale University,Architecture,ARCH803,4.0,1.0,"Her descriptions of how to construct drawings are not perfect, at all.  But this is well outweighed by her excitement for the material, and ability to prod students"

132329,358296,John,MacKay,Yale University,Film,RUSS675,1.0,2.0,"Oh lord save us. ""Promised Lands"" was miserable, best left fallow. Class and Professor were deeply painful experiences.Mackay flops around like ragdoll, spouting references mechanically, all the while assuring us, rubbing his chin in ""contemplation."" Still now, even with class over, I suffer from it, so lord please save me...."
132330,358296,John,MacKay,Yale University,Film,CMPLT570,5.0,2.0,HE IS THE BEST (OR ONE OF TWO BEST) PROFESSORS AT YALE. HIS CLASS WAS INSPIRING AND A JOY ? IT BRIGHTENED EVERY MONDAY!
132331,358296,John,MacKay,Yale University,Film,FILM335,4.0,2.0,So enthusiastic!
132332,358296,John,MacKay,Yale University,Film,FILM330,1.0,2.0,"Prof aches the class as he stumbles around shamefacedly in his explanations as if he were constantly bumping into things: in other words, he speaks as if he's in the dark. Pretends to know a little about everything but can't excite you about anything. SUPER Boring. Tends to over-agree, but his nodding is like a bobble head ornament's."
132335,452116,Michael,Frame,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH8,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Frame is, truthfully, the best professor i've ever had at Yale. In fact, he might be the best instructor i've ever had, ever. The amount of dedicaton he has for his students is awe-inspiring. I hope that he knows how much he means to all of his students, because he is such an inspiration to us all."
132336,452116,Michael,Frame,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,4.0,"The kindest professor ever.  I was really lost in multivariable, and he volunteered to explain the concepts to me every week for 2 hours.  I am so grateful to him."
132337,452116,Michael,Frame,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH115,5.0,3.0,"I loved Prof. Frame!  I'm really not that much of a math person, but math 115 wasn't too hard for me."
132338,452116,Michael,Frame,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH290,5.0,4.0,"He's basically my mentor at Yale. Outside of being funny he's extremely clear and intelligent - take one of the other classes he teaches, i.e. one of the fractal geometry ones."
132339,452116,Michael,Frame,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,4.0,Great! He explains concepts extremely well and is entertaining.
132340,452116,Michael,Frame,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,3.0,"Professor Frame is the best professor I've had at Yale.  Math 120 is notorious for being a tough class, but Prof Frame teaches with amazing clarity.  He's also very helpful in office hours and review sessions.  If you have to take math120, only take his section!"
132341,452116,Michael,Frame,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH120,4.5,4.0,"Excellent prof. On the exam dates students from the other sections asked him questions and finally understood. Very nice guy, brings humor to the classroom. But not too helpful outside of class."
132343,500262,Michael,Faison,Yale University,Physics,ASTR155,5.0,2.0,"Michael Faison is clearly passionate about what he teaches, and he does a good job explaining the material and how it applies to the labs. Hes a lenient grader, and his humor helps captivate the class."
132344,500262,Michael,Faison,Yale University,Physics,ASTR155,5.0,3.0,Professor Faison is really great. I enjoyed his class a ton; he cares a lot about what he teaches and the man is absolutely hilarious.
132345,500262,Michael,Faison,Yale University,Physics,ASTRO110,1.0,5.0,"If you're expecting help then you took the wrong class. Can't explain a concept to save his life. It would be nice if he showed up for office hours when he said he would. He never gives solutions on practice problems, so you're basically studying blind.He may know a lot about astro, but he has difficulty imparting that knowledge to his students."
132346,500262,Michael,Faison,Yale University,Physics,ASTR110,1.5,4.0,"Expect to deal with the TAs and not him.  He is an overly picky grader.  I would recommend going with any other profesor to get a science credit.  That said, it's obvious that he really cares about astronomy."
132347,500262,Michael,Faison,Yale University,Physics,ACHRACHEOASTRON,1.0,4.0,He sucks
132348,500262,Michael,Faison,Yale University,Physics,PLANETSSTARS,4.5,2.0,very interesting. he is super excited about astronomy and it's contagious. great teacher. easy tests.
132350,553357,Dianne,Jonas,Yale University,Linguistics,LING390,4.5,2.0,Phenomenal. Inspired. Wonderful Human being.

132352,553357,Dianne,Jonas,Yale University,Linguistics,LING153,4.5,3.0,"Dianne is wonderful!  She communicates clearly, challenges her students, tries to keep things interesting, and really cares about being a good instructor.  Her syntax class stood up and applauded her on the last day."
132353,553357,Dianne,Jonas,Yale University,Linguistics,LING101,4.0,4.0,"She is a good teacher, but there is a lot of self-teaching as far as her problem sets are involved."
132354,553357,Dianne,Jonas,Yale University,Linguistics,MANY,5.0,1.0,One of the best professors I ever had as an undergraduate.
132358,620209,Paul,Dilley,Yale University,Religion,POLI1050,5.0,2.0,"Dilley teaches at the University of Iowa now, and he does a great job. For the class I had, we had two associate professors (Boehmke is the other and is also a good choice) and a TA, but Dilley was always the one I went to when I had questions. Very smart and good at working with students."
132359,620209,Paul,Dilley,Yale University,Religion,CLSA3443,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, well prepared, lectures often atmospheric"
132360,620209,Paul,Dilley,Yale University,Religion,RELS001,2.5,2.0,"Had Dilley in his first semester at the U of Iowa. His lectures covered the Christianity section of the class. I found them to be very boring. Also, don't take notes off his slides, just take notes from what he says in lecture. Before finals week this semester, he posted all his powerpoint slides. In summary, take notes over what he says out loud."
132361,620209,Paul,Dilley,Yale University,Religion,REL001,5.0,5.0,"OOH, he is so AWESOME!  And SOOOOOOOOOO ridiculously good-looking."
132362,620209,Paul,Dilley,Yale University,Religion,HISTO101,5.0,3.0,"Paul rules!!!  Best teacher I've ever had.  He REALLY, really knows his stuff.  I never realized how much religious history affects everything, until I took his class."
132363,620209,Paul,Dilley,Yale University,Religion,INTROREL,5.0,3.0,What a great teacher! I was lucky to take his class.
132364,620209,Paul,Dilley,Yale University,Religion,JIHAD,5.0,2.0,"Paul rules!  Not only does he know everything, but he's really cool and easy to talk to during office hours.  One of the best TA's I've ever had, seriously."
132365,620277,Charles,Musser,Yale University,Film,FILM455,1.0,4.0,I rate the workload as hard not because there is difficulty in the material that he is assigning. His class is hard because he is so disorganized. He goes on long tangents in class and it rarely has anything to do with the material. Uncomfortable to be around.
132366,620277,Charles,Musser,Yale University,Film,FILMS180,5.0,1.0,"awesome, interesting professor"
132367,620277,Charles,Musser,Yale University,Film,FILM402,2.5,1.0,Cool guy. NOT a good prof.
132368,620277,Charles,Musser,Yale University,Film,FILM150,1.0,4.0,"Last reviewer is sadly generous with their comments. This is worse than imagined. Guy stumbles over simple sentences during lecture like he was doing pratfalls down a set of fake stairs. Sad thing is, its not funny. It happens so often its just not funny. Find a good Ta because Prof will bore you to tears with his confusion and simplemindedness."
132369,620277,Charles,Musser,Yale University,Film,FILM150,3.5,1.0,"He defies belief. How is this guy teaching here? Wind rushes through his head, he has zero capacity to say what's on the screen. Take class if you dont' care about movies and want a grade. Don't take if you care about film. Guaranteed that he will destroy your interest in film watching, film making, film going. Class is a terrible waste of time."
132370,620277,Charles,Musser,Yale University,Film,FILM,1.5,3.0,"He taught a class on silent film at NYU, which resulted in my hating silent films.  In recent years, I discovered that there are many great silent films, but for some reason, Musser didn't include them in his class.  Now I appreciate silent films, no thanks to Charles Musser.  Maybe he's a better professor now.  I hope so, for Yale's sake."
132371,620277,Charles,Musser,Yale University,Film,FILM150,5.0,2.0,Great Course--Prof. is very knowledgeable about early cinema.  He even looks like Orson Welles!  He da Bomb!
132372,73399,Joseph,Chang,Yale University,Mathematics,STAT238,4.5,3.0,Very nice in people and helpful as a teacher.
132373,73399,Joseph,Chang,Yale University,Mathematics,STAT,5.0,3.0,Extremely clear. Almost too helpful. Good challenging courses.
132374,73399,Joseph,Chang,Yale University,Mathematics,STAT551,5.0,1.0,He's good!
132375,73399,Joseph,Chang,Yale University,Mathematics,STAT241,5.0,2.0,Joe Chang is the man.  He will take the time to explain everything to you.  He will not care if you turn things in late.  He will teach you statistics and you will love it.
132376,73399,Joseph,Chang,Yale University,Mathematics,STAT100,2.0,3.0,"stats classes poorly structured.  he taught large lecture hall once a week, had no contact with students.  students from lecture were broken up into six classes (""sections"") for the other day.  his notes were very clear, tho!"
132378,84919,Lourdes,Sabe,Yale University,Spanish,SPAN125,5.0,3.0,Kind and approachable. Really cares about every student in her class. Best professor I've had at Yale.
132379,84919,Lourdes,Sabe,Yale University,Spanish,SPAN115,3.5,4.0,She's a tough professor though she certainly knows how to teach spanish. I thought she was too intimidating.
132380,84919,Lourdes,Sabe,Yale University,Spanish,SPN115,5.0,3.0,I have to agree with the last post (don't know what the one before is talking about). Prof. Sabe has a great sense of humor and really made the class enjoyable. Definitely recommend!
132381,84919,Lourdes,Sabe,Yale University,Spanish,SPA115,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Sabe is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She's fun and demanding at the same time. I never missed a class, really learned a lot, and it didnt hurt that she is gorgeous."
132385,204154,Henry,Sussman,Yale University,Literature,LITR209,5.0,2.0,"I've never had a professor more hilarious, more intellectually engaging, more caring than Henry Sussman. Sometimes, he is incomprehensible. At others, he explodes your brain and puts it back together again. He riffs like Thelonious Monk. It's absolutely inspiring."
132386,204154,Henry,Sussman,Yale University,Literature,LITR226,4.5,3.0,An amazing instructor. Easy-going but thoroughly knowledgeable.
132387,204154,Henry,Sussman,Yale University,Literature,LITR209,4.5,3.0,"Sussman's class is what you put into it.  If you want to breeize through a class, maybe he's an easy A, but if you want to work hard and really learn something, no one will help you more.  He is brilliant, open-minded, and absolutely motivates you to think differently and do better.  Probably my most influential professor at Yale."
132388,204154,Henry,Sussman,Yale University,Literature,ENG300,2.0,2.0,"he is vain, and can be vengeful, if he thinks you didnt admire his pontifications, which tend to be woolly. So think of something pleasant, and glue an interested smile on your face."
132389,204154,Henry,Sussman,Yale University,Literature,LIT120,2.5,1.0,He is a font of vapid new-agey ****.  He is a very nice professor.  If you value niceness in your professor this is the guy for you.  (He is an easy A.)

132392,509293,Marc,Brackett,Yale University,Psychology,PSYCH001,1.0,5.0,This guy is out of his mind. He thinks he is Bruce Lee!
132393,509293,Marc,Brackett,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC165,5.0,2.0,Not half as bad as people say he is!!
132395,509293,Marc,Brackett,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC165,2.5,4.0,He tried way too hard to be funny and actually ended up being really annoying.  The first lecture is not necessarily indicative of his future teaching style.
132396,509293,Marc,Brackett,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC110,5.0,3.0,Good guy. Very funny and informative. Takes his job very seriously and cares about the general welfare of students. Also thoroughly covers the material.
132397,514444,Maria,Pinango,Yale University,Psychology,LINGPSYC,1.0,3.0,"Maria comes across as funny and friendly, but be careful -  she has claws.  She also has a poor ability to communicate her ideas and rambles nonsensically.  Be prepared to repeat her ramblings back at her on her absurd exams.  Maria's classes are a waste of time. Avoid them."
132398,514444,Maria,Pinango,Yale University,Psychology,LINGSEM,2.0,3.0,"While Maria does interesting work and is a nice woman, her communication skills are extremely poor. She will spend huge amounts of time arguing a point without realizing it has nothing to do with the student's question.  More time was spent on miscommunication than on real debate or learning."
132399,514444,Maria,Pinango,Yale University,Psychology,LING231,5.0,4.0,"I loved my classes with her -- she has a way of getting you to think differently about problems that crop up all over the place in Linguistics and psych. If you do the readings and are willing to challenge what you think you know, her classes are no problem and rewarding!"
132400,514444,Maria,Pinango,Yale University,Psychology,LINGSECT,1.5,3.0,Maria is awful.  She simply cannot communicate.  Her class is a waste of time.
132401,514444,Maria,Pinango,Yale University,Psychology,PSYC331,1.0,4.0,Pinango is a nice woman but she is a bad teacher. It is hard to understand what she is talking about. Do not take this course unless you have taken linguistics if you must take it at all. There is no direction in the course so you may struggle a lot. I would not recommend her as a teacher because her classes are usually a waste of time.
132402,514444,Maria,Pinango,Yale University,Psychology,LING117,1.5,4.0,"The course material is awesome but Pinango doesn't do much to help you learn it.  She summarizes the course readings, which can be very long and very bad at times but absolutely amazing at others.  She once spent an entire lecture discussing how a scientific model is falsified and never made a point"

132406,565944,John,Hare,Yale University,Philosophy,DRST002,5.0,4.0,John Hare is the closest humans can come to understanding god
132407,565944,John,Hare,Yale University,Philosophy,REL907,4.0,5.0,"John Hare is a gem, the kind of professor in CS Lewis books. He's brilliant, a leading expert in the field, played Beethoven on the piano to illustrate philosophical concepts, and made me cry while he read poems about God. I will remember his lectures for the rest of my life. He deals in heavy concepts, so do the reading and bring your A game."
132408,565944,John,Hare,Yale University,Philosophy,DRST002,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Hare is fabulous.  He makes philosophy fun and accessible, and introduces new ideas even outside of the DS syllabus."
132409,565944,John,Hare,Yale University,Philosophy,REL827,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Hare is a very clear, literate and precise teacher. He is generous with his comments on papers, but rigorous in his grading which is appropriate for a philosophy course on Kant."

She is a very harsh grader. This class is not easy to get an A in even if you do everything necessary because of the grading, amount of reading, pop quizzes etc."
132418,796649,Jennifer,Bair,Yale University,Sociology,SOCY1061,3.5,3.0,"She teaches at CU Boulder now and I really enjoy this class. You have to be interested in the topics because there is a lot of reading. There are reading quizzes and 3 major essays but she drops the lowest essay score, but kind of harsh grading. Good teacher- drills the concepts into your head. The true/false on the exams are hard and very specific"
132419,796649,Jennifer,Bair,Yale University,Sociology,SOCY1016,1.0,5.0,Absolutely awful! Makes this by far the worst college course I have taken.
132420,796649,Jennifer,Bair,Yale University,Sociology,SOC1101,4.0,3.0,A very good professor who is extremely intelligent in her field of work. She is also able to make her course fun and entertaining. Sex and Gender in Society was a very worthwhile course!!
132421,796649,Jennifer,Bair,Yale University,Sociology,ALL,5.0,1.0,An all around great teacher who really makes you think and care about what she is teaching. Always helpful and takes time to listen. Take any Soc. class she teaches. She's also really pretty to go along with all of her intelligence. I would reccomend her classes to anyone interested in Soc.

Professor Ackerman values different opinions and you will gain his respect, not lose it, if you disagree with his arguments but can raise even a reasonable defence of your position."
132425,839444,Bruce,Ackerman,Yale University,Law,LAW211,4.5,3.0,"He's fantastic if you do the reading. Like all good things in life, you only get as much out of his course as you're willing to put in."

132478,582897,Frederick,Ziegler,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM220,1.0,4.0,Worst professor I have ever had. I would leave lecture more confused than when I started and I can confidently say his lectures made it more difficult to learn organic than had I just learned directly from the text book. The fact that he is still teaching is shameful on Yale's part.

132490,640259,Jonathan,Parr,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM119L,5.0,2.0,He is secretly Ricky Gervais. There is no other explanation! He is super cool. I guess if you aren't into sarcasm you wouldn't understand his humor...
132491,640259,Jonathan,Parr,Yale University,Chemistry,CHEM119,3.0,5.0,"Boo, he was sort of funny for the prelab lectures, but then in lab would mock you if you asked for help."

The way he conducts seminars will help you understand the finer points of every primary and secondary source you use. Very few sources will be written by those outside of the area of interest, geographically or temporally."

We even took class trips to NYC to talk with folks who were black in Paris, visit various exhibits and just sit and eat.  A great course for anyone interested in film, literature, Af Am Studies and Paris."
132517,948072,Terri,Francis,Yale University,Film,FILM150,5.0,4.0,"Professor Francis was a very clear and interesting lecturer.  She used the textbook, but wasn't confined to it and I know for a fact that she fiddled with the traditional syllabus to fit our interests and weaknesses.  I took the course on a whim and feel like I can't watch film in quite the same way."
132518,948072,Terri,Francis,Yale University,Film,FILM150,4.0,5.0,"I had to take this course for my major and made the right choice to wait until Professor Francis taught it again.  She is a demanding lecturer in that she is not relying directly on the textbook, so you definitely need to pay attention. Great to have a thoughtful prof who doesn't read from his/her own textbook."
132519,948072,Terri,Francis,Yale University,Film,FILM150,3.5,4.0,best film prof at yale hands down.  i agree that lecture is not her forte.  take a seminar with her.  itll blow your mind.
132520,948072,Terri,Francis,Yale University,Film,FILM150,1.5,3.0,"Terri Francis is just not lecturing material. If you take the class, be prepared to learn entirely from your TA and textbooks, because Terri uses recycled lecture slides that someone else made up. She gets confused or lost often, and goes around in circles. I feel I would have gotten a lot more out of the course had someone else taught it."

132525,995048,Michael,Farina,Yale University,Italian,ITAL115,1.0,2.0,Very pompous; lacks teaching skills.  I feel like he has something to prove - he lacks depth and intelligence.  Hope Yale 'powers that be' decide to get rid of him soon - he's not a good representation of the school...
132526,995048,Michael,Farina,Yale University,Italian,ITAL115,5.0,4.0,"He will challenge you, but he is kind, helpful, and dedicated to helping you learn Italian. The best introductory language teacher I've ever had."

132534,1697202,Paul,Franks,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL420,5.0,4.0,Paul Frans is the nicest professor at Yale. His seminar is intellectually stimulating and very interesting. He gives great feedback and grades very fairly. I would definitely recommend him.
132535,1697202,Paul,Franks,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL110,4.0,4.0,"Very intellectual, and of course demanding lots of paperwork. And don't bother him to ask for a recommendation letter. Beyond these, you should take his class."

132537,1697202,Paul,Franks,Yale University,Philosophy,PHIL420,4.5,3.0,Hands down my favorite philosophy seminar at Yale.
132538,1697202,Paul,Franks,Yale University,Philosophy,DS004,1.5,4.0,"Paul Franks is an entirely useless professor. He gets annoyed that the class isn't as smart as he is (sorry, we're freshmen in a DS section that we didn't choose) and is rude and unhelpful when you meet with him. He is incredibly boring and unclear in class. All in all, avoid this awful prof."

132542,1881873,Kyle,Luh,Yale University,Mathematics,244,5.0,3.0,He is absolutely amazing. I dont think I have ever had a funnier and smarter TA than him. I would consider retaking the class just based on the joy he brought to my days!!
132543,1881873,Kyle,Luh,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH244,2.0,4.0,"He was alright. He got distracted with too many stories. Sometimes he would say things like ""we are done"" when the problem was not complete and I still was not comfortable with the material."
132544,1881873,Kyle,Luh,Yale University,Mathematics,MATH244,5.0,3.0,"Best TA ever.  He is funny, clever, and very generous with his time.  He made learning discrete math my favorite activity that semester.  Also, he entertained us with many great stories, not necessarily related to math."

Offers the theory of a lifelong academic tempered by the feedback of a seasoned clinician. Great sense of humor and enormously engaging, but don't be fooled because he expects a LOT from students. Not a coasting class."
132549,2268203,Silas,Gray,Yale University,Psychology,PSY315,5.0,4.0,10/10 for smarts and hotness factor. Wish Dr. Gray was available for more courses.

She guided us to plumb deeper into ourselves to create authentic works of self expression."
132557,138951,Frances,Brent,Yale University,English,ENGL120,1.5,4.0,"She believed there was a ""right"" way to write, and then proceeded to break all her own inane rules.

133783,13058,Morton,Kostin,Princeton University,Engineering,MAT305,3.0,1.0,"He's very clear, but very very unkind. You will know what you need to know by just attending lecture; I wouldn't advise actually talking to him."
133787,33700,Robert,Bagley,Princeton University,Art History,ART,5.0,4.0,He completely changed the way I look at art and read about art

133795,174973,Molly,Greene,Princeton University,History,JRSEMINAR,4.5,5.0,"She's very nice and very helpful, but she is a tough grader. And she's definitely NOT hot. But, she is a good teacher, and you'll learn a lot."

133797,199441,Robert,Kaster,Princeton University,Classics,LATIN102,5.0,4.0,Best language teacher I've ever had. Excellent at explaining things and making the language clear. Kaster is an utter champ.

133800,199441,Robert,Kaster,Princeton University,Classics,LAT341,1.5,3.0,He's the country's authority in Latin prose but he is not helpful at all if you meet with him for help.

133808,428040,Hans,Halvorson,Princeton University,Philosophy,PHI201,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors in the Philosophy Department for sure.
133809,428040,Hans,Halvorson,Princeton University,Philosophy,PHI201,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Halvorson is great. If you don't like logic, his intro class will be hard, but that's hardly his fault! He's very clear, open to questions, and always well prepared for lectures. The only downside is that he leans too much towards formal math in his more advanced classes."
133810,428040,Hans,Halvorson,Princeton University,Philosophy,PHI320,4.5,4.0,"Tends to digress, but worth listening to on any topic. Excellent at presenting each argument in its strongest form. Very sincere about his job; takes pains to make sure that everyone understands (almost to a fault). Fascinating guy, nice, funny, brilliant, and interesting. Recommended for any philosophy class."
133812,428040,Hans,Halvorson,Princeton University,Philosophy,LOGIC,3.5,4.0,"basically average in every way (except in intelligence, and with the # of mistakes he makes even that is sometimes doubtful), but he knows it and his self-deprecation is cute - you either love or hate logic, and i think it's worth finding out which"
133814,507556,Miguel,Centeno,Princeton University,Sociology,SRPPUH1811,5.0,4.0,"took his class at NYUAD - discipline and his lectures were amazing. He keeps you engaged and you learn ALOT. Just make sure you do the readings or you might be lost in class. On that note, the readings were pretty long - but it was a 7 week class. Highly recommend him."
133815,507556,Miguel,Centeno,Princeton University,Sociology,WWW,5.0,4.0,Centeno is fantastic in every way. Just don't **** about your grades.
133816,507556,Miguel,Centeno,Princeton University,Sociology,THESIS,5.0,1.0,"The best thesis advisor ever! Get him if you can. Just make sure you make a lot of appointments with his secretary :) But seriously, an awesome advisor!"
133817,507556,Miguel,Centeno,Princeton University,Sociology,SOC250,4.5,3.0,"Lectures very very interesting, lots of reading but interesting &amp; you don't have to do it all. Grading is strict 33%A but not unreasonably hard since many PDF and thus those left don't have to try that hard. Also, no exams, just three fairly short papers"
133819,543288,John V.,Fleming,Princeton University,English,CHAUCER,1.0,3.0,"If you showed up, participated, and were a decent writer and thinker you were fine. But this guy had pets and was really cold and unkind to a couple of people who were socially awkward or perhaps just a little different. Very strange to discuss religious hypocrisy in an environment like this.No prof should treat a student as if they're ""less than."""
133820,543288,John V.,Fleming,Princeton University,English,FRS0,4.5,4.0,Incredible professor.
133821,543288,John V.,Fleming,Princeton University,English,CHAUCER,5.0,2.0,"Fleming retired my senior year -- but if he ever comes back for an encore, get yourself into the class IMMEDIATELY. He's the funniest professor alive. And the most important scholar in his field, which doesn't hurt -- but really his classes are all about laughing at his jokes (which are usually so unfunny they're hilarious). He's amazing, amazing, amazing."
133822,543288,John V.,Fleming,Princeton University,English,COM201,5.0,3.0,"No, Fleming rocks. Whoever gave him a bad rating is either a moron or an impostor."

133824,768666,Natasha,Lee,Princeton University,Literature,FRE359,1.0,1.0,literally NEVER available. Terrible responder to emails. gives NO instructions on midterm/final papers until like a week before the due date. made me never want to take french again.
133825,768666,Natasha,Lee,Princeton University,Literature,FRE208,1.0,3.0,"Similar to what other people have said: extremely unhelpful, pouts when participation is slow"
133826,768666,Natasha,Lee,Princeton University,Literature,FRENLIT,2.0,3.0,My course with Lee was absolutely terrible. She seems really unstable and doesnt care at all about her students. I cant understand why she is a teacher. I will never take a class with her again.
133828,768666,Natasha,Lee,Princeton University,Literature,FRENCHLITERATU,1.0,2.0,"The worse professor I have ever had in 3 years here. Not available ever. totally indifferent to a student's needs. thank goodness I was a french major before taking her course because afterwards i wanted to get as far away from her as possible.

133830,840975,Simone,Marchesi,Princeton University,Literature,ITA303,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Marchesi is, by far and without exaggeration one of the best professors I have ever encountered. He is incredibly dedicated, and his courses are rigorous, well-taught, extremely interesting and fulfilling."
133833,840975,Simone,Marchesi,Princeton University,Literature,ITA303,5.0,3.0,"Professor Marchesi is a wonderful teacher, very clear and concise, and in a seminar he is suberb at drawing the best from his students, and does not try to impress them with his knowledge which is vast."
133834,855947,Muhammad Qasim,Zaman,Princeton University,Religion,NES240,5.0,4.0,"I love his lecture style - doesn't rely too heavily on digital media, nor does he go overboard with the massive amounts of Arabic names and words that he could have used. It's clear, concise, and gives an accurate depiction of a modernist Muslim's worldview without being preachy or apologetic."
133835,855947,Muhammad Qasim,Zaman,Princeton University,Religion,REL520,5.0,4.0,best teacher ever
133836,855947,Muhammad Qasim,Zaman,Princeton University,Religion,REL520,5.0,3.0,"My first (and last time) ever rating a Professor. Very inspirational,kind,humble and such engaging Professor. There's a great deal to learn from him!"

133839,953651,Edgar,Choueiri,Princeton University,Engineering,MAE000,5.0,1.0,Definitely one of the smartest men I have ever met.
133840,953651,Edgar,Choueiri,Princeton University,Engineering,MAE000,5.0,1.0,He's quite awesome. You'd be lucky if you had him. Oh and he's super famous now.
133841,953651,Edgar,Choueiri,Princeton University,Engineering,MAE000,1.0,5.0,he has no idea what he's talking about
133842,953651,Edgar,Choueiri,Princeton University,Engineering,MAE132,1.0,5.0,not surre he understand what he's talking
133843,953651,Edgar,Choueiri,Princeton University,Engineering,MAE400,5.0,4.0,"A fantastic professor, who does an excellent job representing the Princeton MAE program. He is a prime example of a Lebanese gentleman, and also makes a rather good dish of hummus, (or so the Princeton Lebanese students say). I &lt;3 Ranzi."
133844,1462638,Russell,Nieli,Princeton University,Political Science,POL210,4.0,4.0,Very interesting lectures! Manages to explain difficult topics!
133845,1462638,Russell,Nieli,Princeton University,Political Science,POL210,3.5,1.0,"Great at explaining otherwise dense text. Thoroughly enjoyed coming to class with him, and encourage anyone taking a class with him to stay and talk after."
133846,1462638,Russell,Nieli,Princeton University,Political Science,APGOVERNMENT,3.0,5.0,"Really enjoyed Professor Nieli. He was so much fun! I had an awesome Summer experience, and it was a challenging course"
133847,1462638,Russell,Nieli,Princeton University,Political Science,GOV001,3.0,1.0,"Intelligent, yet has a difficult way of conveying it. Is not smooth in speech, and says ""Umm"" far too often. However, he is all together intelligent, and well read."
133848,1462638,Russell,Nieli,Princeton University,Political Science,GOV006,3.0,1.0,He is smart but the way he speaks isnt the smoothest or most interesting.
133849,1793488,Cagan,Yalama,Princeton University,Engineering,PHY101,4.0,4.0,"One of the hardest classes I had last year, but listen to him carefully - he actually tells the final questions in the class."
133850,1793488,Cagan,Yalama,Princeton University,Engineering,PHYSICSR,1.0,5.0,very hard physics teacher
133851,1793488,Cagan,Yalama,Princeton University,Engineering,PHY101,5.0,1.0,10/10 would take class third time
133852,1793488,Cagan,Yalama,Princeton University,Engineering,CBE246,4.5,2.0,I took his Thermodynamics course which was easier than I predicted. He knows a lot about everything but his tests are kinda hard. He doesnt take attendance so come and go as you please
133853,1793488,Cagan,Yalama,Princeton University,Engineering,MAEL01,5.0,2.0,"This is my second time taking Physics, and his class was much more informative and easier to understand. I wish I had him last year."
133854,240868,Francois,Rigolot,Princeton University,Languages,FREN334,5.0,3.0,"He's the best there is, and incredibly nice too."
133855,240868,Francois,Rigolot,Princeton University,Languages,FRENCH,4.0,2.0,He's hot! You should definitely take his class! 2 thumbs up.
133859,340943,Daniel,Marlow,Princeton University,Physics,PHY103,5.0,3.0,"Professor Marlow always did a really good job of explaining difficult concepts in lectures, and he included a bit of humor in his lectures, so I genuinely looked forward to them each week."
133862,340943,Daniel,Marlow,Princeton University,Physics,PHY501,5.0,1.0,Electricity and magnetism was a great course! Marlow was both insightful and interesting.
133863,482271,Michal,Cadden,Princeton University,Theater,EGL400,3.0,4.0,"He seems more amused by his own stories than actually getting into course content. He was just ok. People are often dazzled by his outgoing personality, but that gets old after a few classes. I was grateful I went through several peer editing sessions before turning in my papers. I did fine in the class, but others suffered."
133864,482271,Michal,Cadden,Princeton University,Theater,DRAMATURGYETC,3.5,4.0,"Michael is amusing, I'll give him that. His naughty anecdotes are enough to keep any class flying, and he is certainly one of the most erudite living scholars in his field. But be prepared: he plays favorites like no other professor I've ever had."
133866,482271,Michal,Cadden,Princeton University,Theater,ENGLISH,4.0,3.0,"It has been a long time since I've taken Michael Cadden's classes, but I can still say, unequivocally, he is the best professor I've ever had. His lectures are works of art, and he is a compelling, brilliant presence in the classroom. The unsung gem (to mix a metaphor) of the English Department."

133875,756860,Arion,Melidonis,Princeton University,Anthropology,ANTH101,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Melidonis is, by far, the best teacher I have ever had. His lectures are interesting, his classes are active, and the work that he assigns is insightful. It is impossible to have a conversation with him without learning something, and hes always willing to stop and talk when he can. Have taken 9 units from him and will take more."
133876,756860,Arion,Melidonis,Princeton University,Anthropology,ANTHR105,5.0,1.0,Prof Melidonis' class is a complete cake walk if you care about your grades. Yes you have to come to class and yes you have to keep up with the readings to do well on the test. He really knows the material and is always willing to help students out as long as you are trying to help yourself. A++ PROF!!!
133877,756860,Arion,Melidonis,Princeton University,Anthropology,ANTH202,5.0,4.0,"Mr Melidonis is a professor with Swiftian wit and knowledge honed with an osteodontokaratic precision.

133878,756860,Arion,Melidonis,Princeton University,Anthropology,ETHNOGRAPHY,5.0,1.0,"In a word, he rules. He know what up. Besides, he's got the best kung-fu in the department - by far."
133879,794814,Michael,Wood,Princeton University,English,TRA400,4.5,3.0,"Maybe the best professor I've ever had-- each seminar was engaging, and the assignments were tailored to our interests."
