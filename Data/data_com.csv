0,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,4.0,4.0,He was a cool guy and cared about you and your grade. He cared if you understood the material or not and would offer lots of help and extra credit every week!
1,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,2.0,"I don't even know where to start! 5 star is not enough for him. Dr Stewart is amazing. His class was so fun. I'm an ESL student and his lectures are very clear. He is caring, respectful, kind, and educated. He is always available and I always received immediate response to my emails. He wants you to learn. Take him and you won't regret it."
2,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor! His lectures are easy to follow, he records them so you can watch later. Quizzes were done every lecture class, either by yourself or in groups, and they were easy and helps to boost your grade. Lab was easy to follow and he genuinely cares about you. I wish I could have him for all of my classes!! I got a 99% in the class"
3,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,4.0,"Professor Stewart is truly a gem in the dreaded Chemistry world. Due to the COVID-19 bulls***, our class was placed fully online and for science classes that can be a NIGHTMARE!! Professor Stewart made it seamless and and worked WITH the class when there were road bumps in the way. LOTS of extra credit which really helps your grades. TAKE HIM!!!"
4,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING PROFESSOR! gives out extra credit every week, which adds up in your grade. hybrid class. STUDY DAILY, YOU WILL PASS. lots of homework a week, which is not that bad. Video lectures, which helps in many ways. SO MANY RESOURCES. HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROFESSORS AT ARC."
5,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,3.0,I am so glad to take Prof. Stewart. Even with us transitioning to do everything online due to Covid-19 he was still very understanding and made sure we learn as much as we can. His videos are so helpful! I thought i wouldn't pass because I am not a fan of chem but watching his videos and going through his notes helped me a lot! Thank you sir!
6,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,4.0,Chem 305 hybrid and was not disappointed. One of those rare professors who WANTS students to learn and be successful. Do not be scared to take his course online! He has it so organized and clear! Offers weekly exCrd! Do the EC!! Had him durng the COVID transition and he was flawless Do the work and try and you'll definitelty get a great grade!
7,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,5.0,I highly recommend Professor Stewart for chemistry! I took this class Spring of 2020 and had to transition to online half the semester due to the COVID stay-at-home order. Professor Stewart was still able to teach his class in a way that was easy to handle. He has a big passion for chemistry. Just a great teacher overall!
8,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,3.0,"The professor was amazing!He made everything to make it as easier as possible. Lecture videos online,3 midterms+study-guides and it was very helpful to pass the midterm with a good score,online chapter exam every week based on the lecture videos, no surprises!GOD BLESS HIM he was willing to help us to pass the class not to fail:)"
9,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,3.0,"I heard many great things about Professor Stewart prior to taking his class, he's truly amazing. He's a great teacher and an amazing person. He's passionate about chemistry( a tough class) and makes it fun. He wants students to be successful. Don't understand, ASK! If there were more teachers like him there would be more successful students!"
10,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,3.0,"Such an awesome professor. I took his chem class back in 2016 when I was going through a lot in my personal life. He took the time to make sure I was getting the information that I needed. Its 2019 and Im in my second chem class and regretting that I lost all of my notes. KEEP THEM! Enjoy this class, he makes it great!"
11,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,4.0,I'd heard that chemistry is among the most difficult college courses but Dr. Stewart is an excellent professor. The class is quiz heavy but he provides ample resources and all it takes to do well is an investment of time. Be prepared to truly learn and apply the concepts. Highly recommend Dr. Stewart if you are seeking a solid chem foundation.
12,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,4.0,3.0,"Online quizzes help for In class quizzes. Records his lectures. Don't miss lab, it makes a big part of your grade. Quizzes are easy. Lets you have an index card for midterms and finals. Fair grader. Good professor."
13,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,3.0,Professor Stewart was absolutely awesome. This was my second time taking chemistry and he really made it easy to understand the basics of chemistry and pass the class. Dont miss the quizzes or the labs and youll easily pass. And on Wednesdays he would try to do a fun demo to show how cool chemistry is. I really enjoyed his class.
14,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,4.0,"By far the best chem professor I've had so far. Records his lectures and puts them online. Explains concepts really well. Many tests and quizzes, but it's what prepares you for exams and his way of teaching WORKS. 10/10 would recommend!"
15,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,2.0,"Best professor you can take for chem 305. Gives a lot of quizes (group, online) and it really prepares you for the exams. It was really good for me because I don't like to study much and the quizes were great review. He also records his lectures so you can find them on canvas. Tests are all multiple choice"
16,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,5.0,"College Professor that doesn't put up with your nonsense; either be there TO learn or skip this class because you're expected know the information; he loves Chemistry and it shows. Three tests a week, lots of reading and memorizing of the subject. NOT an easy class. Want a head start? Read and memorize the back of the required book, both sides."
17,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,4.0,3.0,"Pros: Explain lecture SUPER well with many examples. He record his lecture, its so helpful. If you ask him for some practice problems he will post some up. Cons:can be rude. not very approachable. There are trick questions on test &amp; quiz. Overall:weekly quiz due Sunday,Chapter test &amp; group test every week. Lecture are usually one chapter per week"
18,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,305,5.0,3.0,"Have you ever felt sad to finish a class? That was my feeling when I done with Mr. Steawart's class. Awesome is not enough to describe this amazing professor. Despite I'm a non English speaker, finished my high school long time ago, so I have already forgotten what H2O is :) I learned a lot in his class. Take him you won't regret it!"
19,1094219,Daniel,Stewart,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM305,5.0,2.0,"I loved this class! Professor Stewart really cares and gives students plenty of opportunities. 1 thing is dropped in every category. Exams every class, but since theres so many it keeps you from falling behind and helps maintain a high score. No surprises, you know exactly what to expect.. Thank you Professor Stewart!"
21,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL300,1.0,4.0,Difficult tests. Roundabout lectures. Skip this professor if you can.
22,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS320,5.0,3.0,Prof Unmack is great. Her class is very straight forward and she does not leave her students to do a lot of guessing as to what her expectations are. I love listening to her lectures as she is very smart and knows a lot about what she is talking about. Unmack and Collihan are some of the only prof's with classes that are understandable and clear.
23,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL330,5.0,4.0,"As long as you listen to the lectures, read the Court cases and their rulings with the ability to analyze them, take good notes, and once again read you will do good in her class. Her lectures are always interesting. She will keep you engaged to the lectures because she seems passionate about what she is teaching."
24,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL301,1.0,5.0,"Prof. takes up to a month or more to grade exams &amp; post then on canvas. So you really never know what your grade is. Her lectures are irrelevant to the exams, also 4 exams total &amp; each worth 150 points. She takes forever to reply back to emails. Basically you're teaching the course yourselves. Prof. doesn't accept late work."
25,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,5.0,3.0,"Very easy online course, one chapter every week and an inquizative assessment that helps reinforce digital textbook material. Voice text for The book is available on windows and iPad. In The News assignment every other weeks but its very easy to find a news article and relate it back to the book. Almost every test and quiz answer is on google."
26,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS481,5.0,3.0,I really like prof unmack. she grades very fairly and is very passionate about what shes teaching. the exams are very similar to the lectures and readings. she gives out a decent amount of extra credit. definitely not hard to get an A. however it does take her a bit of time to input scores and she often goes off topic when people ask questions...
27,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL301,1.0,5.0,"You can never get in touch with her, assignments finished 2 months prior still haven't been graded, she expects you to know all of the material on her level, all the tests are long and worded confusingly and you have about a minute per question. The tests are also worth about 100 points each with the average grade being a D."
28,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS320,1.0,5.0,"She doesnt know how to teach without going off topic, grades tests unfairly, and takes forever to grade papers."
29,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL301,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this professor. You will be succumbed by a loads of work and there will be at least 4 chapters on one single exam. Exams are heavy and she gives you no break on Thanksgiving so you have no chance to catch up. She never replies to any emails, any calls for help and grades work 2-3 weeks late so you never know how you stand in the class."
30,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL301,1.0,4.0,I took her online POLS 301 class and the average grade for her exams was around 65%. Her exams are super hard to pass and she's a very tough grader. She also never responded to any of the emails for the help that I sent her. You never know your actual grade in the class because it takes her 2-3 weeks to grade a simple assignment. Wouldn't recommend
31,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS330,4.0,3.0,"lecture heavy, no homework just tests and a poster for final. tests are about cases learned in class so attendance really helps but not mandatory."
32,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS320,5.0,4.0,"This class is different. You really have to care about this topic because she really cares about it. You gotta read and be ready to use what you read in the tests since that's the bulk of the points. Her tests are not hard to pass, but you need to say lecture material and a bit of the reading. Again, You actually have to care about the subject."
33,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS320,1.0,5.0,Shes not a good professor at all.
34,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS320,1.0,5.0,Her class is very difficult and I regret taking her for political theory.
35,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS320,2.0,4.0,"Takes forever to grade assignments that were due 2-3 months ago, always gets off topic during lectures, 3 unit tests that has essay questions worth a lot more than multiple choice, poster presentation towards end of the semester. If POLS 320 wasnt a requirement to transfer, I wouldnt have taken it."
36,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL301,3.0,4.0,"She really is a nice professor, but I felt like she has her online class as second priority as assignments that were completed 2-3 months ago are still yet to be graded. There is loads of reading and lots of uploaded written assignments and discussion board posts. Exams are super long and very time restricted, as she expects you to know your stuff"
37,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL300,5.0,4.0,"Professor Unmack is beyond inspirational, every single class she came with a passion and love for political science!!! I would highly recommend her, she makes political science come to life in a way I never expected!!! I got more than 100% in her class!"
38,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS481,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed Ms. Unmack for my first honors class. She kept lectures interesting, graded fairly, and made us work on a poster/paper combo which was pretty cool. I received an A and learned the content well. The only problems I personally had with the class was the grading period of assignments/exams and that she sometimes went on minor tangents."
39,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POLS480,3.0,3.0,"She gets off topic a lot during lectures, she likes to ramble and talk a lot. I was bored during her lectures, if you don't like lectures every class I would not recommend. She also takes a while to grade, never saw my last 4 projects or assignment grades bc she took too long to grade them. Easy class though, never used the book and got an A."
40,384832,Cynthia,Unmack,American River College,Political Science,POL300,5.0,3.0,"Study the guides for tests, drops lowest test. Sticks to syllabus, doesn't allow late work normally. Boring lectures, but have test answers. Very passionate and gets sidetracked into class discussions."
42,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,3.0,"Prof Petersen is extremely knowledgeable in his subject matter. Takes his time to explain and ensure that we comprehend the material. If you attend the classes and pay close attention to his lecture, you'll get the material."
43,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,4.0,4.0,"Professor Petersen was an outstanding professor, he is very knowledgeable and very clear on what makes up your grade in the class. He hands out many sheets throughout lectures and discussions are frequent and usually on the test.  So pay attention to the discussions and to review the handouts in addition to the textbook when prepping for exams!"
44,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302MACRO,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Petersen is a really knowledgeable teacher. He has had years and years of experience in bank and investment industry. He has a refreshing sense of humor and provides the class a daily joke.  The exams are logical. Pay attention, take notes, read the textbook and you will do well. As he stated on day one he doesn't give grades. We earn them."
45,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,3.0,I had Peterson for both ECON302 &amp; 304. The homework isn't graded. Your entire grade consists of exams and they are not easy. He tests to make sure you truly grasp the material. You are allowed 1 page of handwritten notes. It requires some work but an A is possible. Class is only 8 weeks long rather than 16. Nice guy. Starts class with a joke.
46,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.0,3.0,"Yes the lectures for this class are long and last he full time, however, if you show up to class each time, take notes and do the necessary reading, you are bound to pass. Professor Peterson is very helpful and is more than willing to answer any questions you have, even on the exam. There is no graded hw or quizzes, just the exams and extra credit."
47,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.5,4.0,"Mr. Petersen is a great professor and wants all his students to succeed. Yes lecture is long, but it's an 8 week class, what do you expect? The grades are solely based off 4 exams, first 3 exams he allows 1 page of notes and for the final it's open book, but you still need to study to do well. He does offer extra credit too. Definitely recommend."
48,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,3.0,Mr. Petersen likes to start the class off with a joke and wants you to succeed. Your grade is determined solely by exams. There is homework but it's not turned in or graded. The exams are difficult and test that you know how to apply the concepts. If you study and take the time to understand the material it's completely possible to pass the class.
49,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.5,1.0,"Petersen is an amazing prof, truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He is honestly the kindest prof i have had. The lectures are very boring yes, but get through it and take notes and you will do well. You can get an A in this class without problem, just put in the work."
50,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,3.5,4.0,I took him for both 301 and 302. Both 8 week classes. I dont know if it was just me but the material is hard. All he does is read from book for lectures. Doesnt really explain things to clearly.
51,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,2.0,5.0,"He is really qualified went to Stanford ect Im just really disheartened that as a student who gets As in every class I got a B in 302 &amp;C in 304 and this was I class I was genuinely interested in No idea where i went wrong, handful of students did well some didnt I guess some get the concepts some dont Idk if  UCLA will take me, take at ur own risk!"
52,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,1.0,5.0,"This class isnt as easy as I thought it would be. He just reads from the book and this isnt a class were yrs of memorization will save u , u really need to understand whats going on. Im an A student and im struggling. Warning for impatient people,moves very slow,discusses fast and easily distracted"
53,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.5,2.0,"Professor Peterson is a great professor. He is always willing to help you. In his exams, he includes questions from study guide. He gives you credit for showing up in the class. He doesn't let you get bore."
54,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,4.0,"Professor Peterson is a dedicated, caring, and committed as a teacher. I can tell he takes pride in being effective as teaching. I especially appreciate the fact that he is so interesting and knows how to motivate student to learn, to think for ourselves, and to thrive. Most students  express our gratitude and respectful of him.  Thank you. "
55,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON 302,3.5,3.0,"Professor Petersen gives his students all of the tools needed to succeed.  If you don't, its on you.  Show up, take notes, do the homework and study for the tests.  Do not think tests will be easy because of the page of notes allowed.  The tests are tough!  He takes role at the end of every class.  That should change, takes way too long."
56,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Petersen is a great teacher. I love his sense of humor and his life experience lessons.  He stands for students, not against them and helps a lot. You will have an option to have an extra credit,  he  choose interesting, bestselling books about economics and you will have multiple choice test on it, and it can drop up your grades very easy."
57,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,1.0,Very good teacher. helpful and knowledgeable. Just read and study and will pass easily
58,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.0,1.0,"Everything professor Peterson does is for the success of the students. He goes over every test in detail the class before the exams and offers a lot of extra credit at the end of the class. Even if his lectures are a little vague, you are very likely to do well in his class."
59,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,2.0,He is seriously an amazing teacher I'm now taking my second semester with him and I couldn't be happier he's clear and thorough on the information that is necessary and needed to study and use for the course.
60,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,302304,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Very easy-going. Put in some effort and you can get an A without problems.
61,468693,David,Petersen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,3.0,"Prof Peterson gives you every opportunity to succeed in the class.  He stays late, answer any question, and although his credentials are very impressive, is not full of himself. He teaches at the students level.  I enjoyed Macro and Micro and would take classes taught by him again.  Thanks Professor for a great semester. Extra credit for attendance"
63,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON302,2.0,4.0,His lectures are really unhelpful and vague and will not help you. Expect to learn the material by yourself. Does offer extra credit after every test that will usually bump you a letter grade on the test
64,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,1.0,4.0,requires you to buy pearson for +$100 but makes it difficult to even do so in the first place. instructed to clear cache and cookies but pearson still kept erroring and there was no easy course code to just enter and I had to submit a support ticket as well as email a different person as instructed. i personally hate classes that require pearson...
65,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,4.0,2.0,"LOL this professor is so funny. The professor was extremely honest and sometimes made me laugh. Although it was online and everything, the class was easy. He was also extremely contact-friendly outside of class which was really cool. Also gave a lot of EC, which made up the scores on my EXAMS LOL. Anyways, take him! Hes coolio. XD RAWR :3 uwu"
66,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,3.0,3.0,"Took his Summer online Microecon class. 3 exams and a bunch of hw and quizzes through PearsonMyLab. The content can be hard and he does not really lecture. I benefited from reading the book and doing the problems that way. He posted lecture videos, which I did not find that helpful. He does give bonus point opportunities for exams though."
67,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,1.0,4.0,Brian Rosario is a professor I would never recommend. He's very vague in his lecturing and makes it seem that he doesn't want to be there lecturing. I dropped the class after trying him out for three weeks.
68,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,4.0,"Professor Rosario is funny and knowledgeable. His lectures consist of real life examples and for some people that works and for others it doesnt. His class made me enjoy Econ. His grading is clear. You have weekly HW and quiz on pearson, lots of extra credit opportunities if you dont take advantage of those then your loss, and 3 exams in total."
69,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,3.0,Professor Rosario is very relatable and has a sense of humor. He will answer your questions but some students do not appreciate his honesty. If you are sensative to comments or constructive criticism on your work then he might not be right for you. Professor Rosario will use real world examples that help to understand concepts.
70,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,4.0,3.0,"All HW &amp; quizzes are online, open book/notes. Gives plenty of time before due dates. Lectures are important. He'll tell you what material to expect on Exams. ALWAYS COME TO LECTURE AFTER AN EXAM. He offers a chance to get more points towards your score, ONLY if you're there &amp; sign in. Very straight forward &amp; gives many real life examples."
71,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON302,1.0,2.0,"Professor Rosario's class is a weird one. He is very unhelpful, and fails to explain things thoroughly. Whenever someone asks a question he seems like it's such a burden for him to respond. He assigns 1 homework and 1 quiz per week, along with 3 exams. His lectures are long and boring. He tries to joke, but it always flops. I recommend staying away"
72,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON204,5.0,2.0,"Straightforward; weekly online homework and quiz, 3 tests and plenty of extra credit. Assignments and tests are not hard. Take him."
73,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECN302,1.0,5.0,"Usually I never write things on here because most professors arent that bad, Rosario on the other hand is possibly the WORST professor ever. He is honestly a bad person as he does not care about your personal problems. His free responses on tests are extremely confusing but multiple choice okay, PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
74,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECN302,2.0,4.0,"Usually i would wait till the end to rate a professor, but this teacher is extremely disrespectful from the get go. (i understand the things teachers go through and the stress of managing many students/classes.) Currently taking a night class with him and when people ask him questions he seems like he tries to make them feel dumb. zero respect."
75,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECN302,5.0,4.0,"Amazing Professor. I really enjoyed the class. I got a lot of interesting and helpful information. His lectures are really interesting. There are a lot of extra credits. If you do all stuff what Professor gives you, it is easy to get A. I would definitely recommend to to have this Professor."
76,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECN302,2.0,3.0,"Classes are mostly boring and lecture heavy. Brian try to make alot of jokes, some better than the other's. Exams are confusing but he compensate with extra credit. Make you buy a $100 textbook just for the homework. Don't ask questions since he's clearly not interested in them by giving you a hard time. I love economics but not with him."
77,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,3.0,3.0,The entire class is only lecture. Sometimes it's really boring but he often throws in a joke to keep it interesting. He gives LOTS of extra credit. I never go an A on a test but got an A in the class because the class it points based with no extra weight on tests. The extra credit is enough to bump you up a letter grade. So do it!
78,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,3.0,3.0,A lot of students timid to ask questions he will give you a smart answer and look at you funny if he feels your question is stupid its pretty funny at times. DO THE HOMEWORK especially if not a good test taker he does gives you real life examples in class and he may definitely teach you some thing you didn't know about the business world.
79,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,1.0,Do every single assignment and extra credit offered. A high B or A will be yours. The hybrid version of his class is best. His work is all online. He is easy to talk to and makes class interesting. Ive taken him twice now. Micro and macro. A in both and I knew nothing about econ.
80,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.0,3.0,"Thoroughly explains concepts and tells you what to focus on, what will be on the test, and what to skip on. Hws are due every week or so on MyEconLab, and tests are on the current CHs. Final is NOT accumulative. No attendance, but it helps to come to his class to know when extra credits are due. He does not update announcements online. Take him!"
81,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,2.0,"He explains things well. Show up to lectures, do the homework and youll do fine. He also gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit 3 or 4 points here and there adds up."
82,933825,Brian,Rosario,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,3.0,"Gives you relatable examples so you can understand the material. Grading structure is clear as day and if you do well during the semester, the final is optional. Offers extra credit randomly so make sure you attend class. He drops a few assignments and quizzes off total score as well."
84,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,CALC400,5.0,2.0,Best part about this class is that the professor makes it makes it easier for us. Everything on the test is every you learned. Plus he gives plenty of time to practice the material before moving on.
85,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH400,5.0,1.0,Professor Deleon is amazing and funny. His class is not boring at all. He assigns hw from book which wasn't too hard to do. His tests are easy. It was mostly from lecture and hw. He's also helpful. He's a wonderful math teacher.
86,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,1.0,Professor Deleon is the most caring instructor I've ever had. He wants EVERYONE to pass his course. He is always in a positive mood and a super down to earth human being. Wishing him best of luck and success in his life. It's nearly impossible to fail his class and I suck at math. Take him and you will know exactly what I mean(; 100% recommend.
87,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,CALC400,1.0,4.0,"Took 400 with him because of previous ratings. Man what a big mistake. Although a funny and entertaining man, no structure to his classes whatsoever, relies on his own memory rather than the material leaving you unprepared for his tests and for 401. Don't take him for anything 400 or above or you'll screw yourself over. First non-A I've received :/"
88,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,4.0,Professor Deleon is by far the best math professor ever. Hes hilarious and makes tough math problems easy for you. He doesnt want you to take stress and explains everything thoroughly. You can ask questions as much you like and he would not mind explaining. He truly wants you to understand material and succeed. Very caring who respects students.
89,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,CALC400,2.0,2.0,"Professor DeLeon is genuinely a nice guy. His personality and quirks keep the class interesting, however his lessons have very little organization. It feels as if each class is improvised and can be a tad difficult to follow. While he means well enough, the disorganized structure of his classes can be detrimental."
90,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,5.0,2.0,Really nice and wants everyone to pass.
91,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH120,1.0,2.0,"This professor was the worst math teacher I've ever taken. I really wanted to learn and understand what I was doing but it was impossible because he'd go off on tangents and tell stories, which were amusing, granted, but didn't have anything to do with math. If you need to learn this for higher math class, take someone else. If you need an easy a.."
92,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,3.0,"Mr Deleon was so funny, he wants to make sure everyone understand his point. Don't be afraid to ask questions. He gives extra credit for all chapters homework by the end of the semester. Optional answers test. Not important if you show up but what it matters is how you do in the tests. Participation matters in class. I recommend him."
93,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,5.0,3.0,"If you ever get to take Prof Deleon then I would 10/10 recommend him. He is funny and has a different style of teaching, however I have ADHD so the time I usually start to drift is when he starts to be silly. Class is not mandatory he understands you have a life and treats you like an adult.. Never any HW."
94,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,1.0,1.0,"Prof. Deleon is a funny and caring guy. He is definitely a family man and would do anything in his power to help someone. Although, he does have his bad qualities. Teaching Math 100 is one of them. If you have a tough time with math and need motivation this teacher is not for you. He sings laughs and tells stories. He teaches math, but not so good."
95,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH400,4.0,1.0,"If you are looking for a all jokes and laughs, lay back, chill math professor, Id suggest this class because he sings and tells stories constantly so I couldnt really get what was going on in class. His way of teaching is kind of difficult to understand so its best to have the textbook even though it was not required. But such a sweet guy."
96,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,5.0,1.0,It took some time for me to adjust to his teaching style because he tends to tell lots of stories or sing songs during the lessons. He doesn't require you to purchase the textbook as he goes over the sections from the book in class. He doesn't assign homework or takes attendance. He is very understanding and doesn't want to stress his students out.
97,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,5.0,1.0,"Ive taken two math classes before this &amp; was severely stressed out. But Professor Deleons motto is its not worth it. He wants math to be fun, for us to learn and not be full of tears. Most of his classes contain dad jokes, stories and a little math. He never puts his students on the spot And he understands people have life outside of class."
98,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,4.0,2.0,"DeLeon is a cool guy, just a real scatterbrain though. He cancelled a few of quizzes and never assigned hw. As a student I need motivation, so I stopped showing up. Hilarious, but most of the class is spent telling stories that have nothing to do with anything. Forgetful, so don't take the class if you really struggle with math, he's not much help."
99,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,1.0,"Awesome guy, def take him if you have the chance, no matter what class!"
100,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,5.0,1.0,This Guy is AWSOME. It is hard to find his classes open to enroll. If open GET it. You wont regret. 1000% will get it again and recommend.
101,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH100,5.0,2.0,"I love this man. He is too funny. I hate math with a passion, but going to his class starts my day off great. He doesnt care what people think about him and i love it! He doesnt make me feel dumb when i ask him so many questions. There is no professor like him, hes awesome. There NEEDS to be more like him pleaseeeee!!!  Wish he was my dad."
102,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH400,5.0,1.0,IF you are having a hard time with Calculus.... that sucks lol. If you take this professor i can assure you will get an A+ without blinking! He's so funny! cracks jokes every 2 seconds. Easy A but you still learn :) Amazing@! cant stress this enough!--- TAKE HIM! The practice worksheets are so similar to an exam. Get as many notes as you want!
103,248024,Leonel,Deleon,American River College,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,2.0,"Easy teacher, easy A! I would take him again. Wish he taught stats."
105,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC300,4.0,2.0,"nice professor, easy class. each week, read a chapter, take 2 quizzes, and a discussion post once in a while. 4 tests, plus the final, and 1 writing assignment. 2 extra credit quizzes, and you can retake one of the tests at the end of the semester. she makes helpful study guides for each chapter, and all you have to do is fill them out."
106,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC300,5.0,4.0,Really clear grading rubric. I took the class online and she offered a grade improvement exam at the end of the semester to improve your worst exam grade. Lots of textbook usage and good lecture notes. Use her provided study guides and you'll pass.
107,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC300,2.0,5.0,"Very few assignments, but lots of reading and note taking. 2 quizzes every week; 3 exams every 3 weeks. Quizzes and tests will MAKE your grade. There is hardly enough time to complete all the reading and do all the recommended notes each week, which makes passing the tests and quizzes difficult. Very strict on what is due, and there is a lot."
108,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PHYSC300,2.0,4.0,"when she was present in class, she was lecture HEAVY. but something happened and she was completely gone, we had different subs everytime. i wasn't sure what to study for the exams she still gave even though she wasn't teaching. she did give extra credit. take her ONLY if you already know psych and just need a refresher, otherwise don't."
109,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSCH300,2.0,4.0,"Her tests are difficult, and a lot of the material on them includes stuff that we've never seen in her lectures. She was also gone for a month and still gave us an exam that was important to our grades when we didn't even have class. Avoid this teacher"
110,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC310,5.0,3.0,"Professor McCormick is the best professor I have ever taken. I took her general psychology, biological psychology, and biological psychology lab class. She is super organized and gets your grades back super quick. She is so helpful and loves what she does. If you follow the syllabus, it should be a super easy A."
111,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC300,5.0,3.0,"Literally not hard at all, she offers so much extra credit, you have to pass with an A. Everything was super easy. I mean her essay project was a little challenging, because she did have higher expectations. But still passed with an A with no effort so I cannot complain."
112,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSCH300,4.0,3.0,"The online class wasn't my first, and her set up could be easier and more user friendly but it still wasn't hard to navigate. 4 exams and a final along with a few discussion boards. She gives you online study guides which make studying much easier. I look forward to taking her next semester."
113,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSCH300,5.0,5.0,"The subject requires you to remember a lot of information. Being Online you must participate or you'll get dropped; but you get plenty of time to read, study and participate in group discussions; no reason to slack off. She gives opportunities for extra credit and a grade improvement; hard subject if Psychology is not your thing. Get ready to read!"
114,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSY356,5.0,2.0,Marcia is the best. I took her for psych of women and it was such a great class. I didn't buy the textbook and just used her Powerpoints and my notes to study and got an A on every test. Didn't have to take the final. Her lectures were very interesting to me. Very minimal homework. She is super sweet and I highly recommend her for any psych class.
115,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSY356,5.0,2.0,Very solid teacher that teaches with enthusiasm and likes what she does. Very practical course and taught in a stream lined way. Take notes and review book before testes and it will be a breeze.
116,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PHYSC300,4.0,3.0,Strictly online psychology course. Crisp clear criteria and is responsive to questions. She used both her own questions on tests and also Pearson online quizzes.
117,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC300,5.0,4.0,"She is an amazing professor! Her lectures are very well paced and easy to follow. As long as you pay attention and take notes, you will do good. She makes the topics interesting and fun. Only one essay. I honestly have never studied and I have a B. I would highly recommend her and plan on taking another one of her classes if possible."
118,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSY356,5.0,2.0,"She is so nice I loved taking her class. It was easy to follow her lectures and her tests were super strait forward! Wonderful kind and funny women, will admit when she doesn't know something and look it up so that she can give you the right answer. If you can take her class do it I don't think there a better human sexuality teacher on campus!"
119,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC300,5.0,3.0,"She's the best. All you need to do is show up, listen to the lecture, which by the way are very well explained, refresh your memory by reading the textbook and you'll ace this class. If you do that you'll get an A."
120,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSY356,5.0,3.0,She was an excellent teacher! She knows how to explain the material and is very good t connecting with you as a class. She is a nice and bubbly person and makes you feel comfortable. Attendance is considered mandatory but if you miss a few classes it's fine. She puts all lectures and study guides online.
121,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYCH300,5.0,4.0,"After taking both psyc300 and psyc356 (human sexuality) with Prof. Mccormick, i found a new love for psychology.  Her lectures are very straight forward and her grading is simple. She loves participation from the class, and the more her students interact,  the more interesting you'll find the material. She easily relates the class to real life."
122,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSYC300,5.0,2.0,"If you're looking for an interesting and easy-to-understand Psych class, TAKE McCORMICK! (I took Psych300 with her and I am planning to take more classes with her next semester) She is sensitive to the fact that the students in her Psych300 class are mostly freshman, so don't worry about feeling overwhelmed."
123,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSCH300,5.0,4.0,Great teacher very outgoing. She's one of the funniest teachers I've had. She goes over the material very well and puts out a lot of resources to study for exams. If you do not enjoy/want to study don't take the class. Her tests are very hard with a lot of material covered in them and her four exams make up 70% of your grade.
124,487734,Marcia,McCormick,American River College,Psychology,PSCH300,3.0,4.0,I took her online psych300 class.  It was a good class although online classes are difficult and you really need to apply yourself and set time aside to learn the material.  The tests and quizzes were very difficult.
126,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,1.0,3.0,"There's lots of pointless homework. The professor was rude to me when I asked about accessibility to the articles we have to read every week. When I suggested a better quality copied article, I was told I had a learning disability (I don't) The article was literally just hard to read on a screen. don't waste your time and take a different class"
127,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,1.0,5.0,"If you want to waste your weekends doing a ridiculous amount of homework then pick this class. The professor assigns too much work for one class with poor resources to find answers. Lastly the professor makes accusations of cheating without proof. This college has many great professors that are better than this one, dont waste your time."
128,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,4.0,"Such an amazing professor. Really opened my eyes to the world of sociology. Lectures were clear and concise and the exams made you really think like a sociologist. I recommend this class and this professor to anyone who is even a little bit interested in, or is just curious about sociology."
129,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hijazi is fantastic. Very kind, funny and lectures are entertaining and educational. Three exams (gives out really helpful study guides), and weekly-biweekly quizzes on readings. Very engaging in class, enjoys participation and does a great job explaining material in depth."
130,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,4.0,"He made sociology very interesting. His teaching style worked well for the course content, making subjects relatable and retainable. I would suggest him to anyone taking sociology. He gave extra credit opportunities and as someone previously stated, if you take good notes, you should do fine in the class."
131,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC350,1.0,5.0,"Poor teacher, course content was disorganized , boring lectures, lackluster effort by the teacher who does not seem to care about students. The best advise for others is to choose another professor."
132,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,1.0,5.0,"Horrible instructor , poor knowledge of the subject (sociology) itself and all other subject matters, which associate with the course . Homework is confusing and exam questions do not make any sense. In the end, best to find a more intellectual professor then this one ."
133,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC350,5.0,3.0,He is really an amazing sociology teacher. He knows his stuff and is very educated. Although his quizzes may be tough he gives extra credit and if you ever need anything he really is one of those teachers who listen and will do their best to help you. Great prof
134,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,4.0,"Taking this as an online course and I can say he's one of the best online professors I've ever had. He's really caring!! But, his weekly assignments consist of heavy reading from the textbook, quizzes, and heavy writing assignments. He's strict about detail, but thats only because he's passionate about the subject and wants you to actually learn."
135,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,1.0,4.0,"Just talked the whole class, no notes, no lectures, just expected us to sit and listen to him talking. Very boring and impossible to listen to. I dropped because I figured I shouldnt waste my time by not learning a single thing."
136,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Would recommend
137,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,4.0,3.0,"For Hijazi's hybrid class, reading the textbook is important to get all the info. Also discussions every week and homework online. The exams were in bluebooks so you had to know what you were writing about. Lectures are a bit scattered and not all the material is touched on in the class period."
138,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,3.0,3.0,"Their was 3 articles a week varying in length, some could be 10 pages while others could be 4, and a chapter in the textbook to read. Typically their was a quiz every week on the articles and the chapter, sometimes an article assignment with very unclear criteria. A Discussion was also due on the material from the week. It was an okay online class."
139,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hijazi is an amazing professor hands down!! Lectures are amazingly interesting and the way he teaches will always keep you hooked during lecture. I would rate higher if possible! One of the best classes I habe ever taken, thanks to professor Hijazi!!"
140,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,4.0,"Online class, take that into account, you have to make up for time not spent in a classroom. Lots of reading; esp. of relevant articles. A lot of media to watch. Discussion board posts every week. I like him &amp; you can really learn a lot from this professor. No big tests, just quizzes every week &amp; 6 short papers. Communication is key, &amp; be polite."
141,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,4.0,"If you are looking for an easy class/ teacher this is not your best option, However, if you want to learn some very cool things about yourself and the people around you this is the class to take. Professor Hijal is awesome, he's not an easy grader some of the work is a bit challenging but if you make an effort you can get the grade you work for."
142,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,4.0,2.0,"He is super clear in what he wants every week! 1 discussion bored post(due by Saturday), 1 test based on the chapter reading, and either a test or a writing assignment from the 3 articles( both due Sunday) This is every week. While it can be a lot of reading, the readings are SUPER interesting. It might make you rethink how you view things."
143,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC318,5.0,4.0,Professor Hijazi was awesome. I enjoyed his class more than my other classes. There is no textbook. He just uploads articles that we read and take quizzes on. Everything we discuss is really thought provoking. It's never boring and he is really funny. His exams are not the easiest BUT his gives us everything we need and notecards to use.  Show up!
144,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,2.0,3.0,i took his online class and really was not that impressed with the class format nor his knit picky responses to my work. I just did what needed to be done to earn an A. I feel he could improve his tentativeness and his reply skills. slow grader. kind of snarky to students who don't buy into everything the material asserts. i give him a 6/10
145,242348,Nidal,Hijazi,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,2.0,5.0,He expects far to much out of a online class. I honestly believe he cares about his subject but he requires far to much time to be put into this general ed course.
147,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,4.0,"I mentioned lots of homework. Not actual assigned, graded homework (about 1 /week) but the work you have to do on your own to prepare for the tests. Most of the lecture is spent working independently. Basically there for questions. Dont bother emailing for help, she wont respond. Dont get too attached to your grades, they change days later."
148,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,4.0,She does not respond to email or care. I asked for help &amp;was told to drop. After ignoring emails about my health issues &amp;help she reached out to an admissions counselor instead &amp; discussed personal matters while taking role. Lectures are poor at best &amp;tests are not consistent w/ them. She grades &amp; changes it days later. Worst professor Ive taken.
149,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,5.0,3.0,"Any chemistry class will be hard, that's the cost of taking chem. Dr. Roy makes classes like chemistry a real pleasure to take. She knows the material extensively and knows how to teach it. She's fair when grading and extremely caring. A real inspiration for any student pursuing an education in STEM."
150,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,5.0,4.0,"Professor Roy has office hours and always responds to emails. Chem 309 is a hard class because it is 2 semesters of chemistry in 1, there is a quiz almost every week and a homework assignment every week. There is no busywork but if you want to pass the class you need to study because the tests and quizzes include a lot of information."
151,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,She bring the questions of tests and quizzes out off the book so you cant pass this class as much as you try. I made drop. Wouldnt take her again.
152,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,2.0,5.0,"What you will do in HW, Lecture, Quiz is not what you will find on the test. She puts information on test's she hasn't even tought, or will teach in future."
153,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,"Her lectures isn't clear not grading well not helpful, disappointed, doesn't encourage you, doesn't care, give the lectures for her self no matter if you understand or not. No extra credit. Wouldn't take her again :("
154,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,Wasn't helping Prof and grade everything as she want not as you answer correctly this class was waste for time. Wouldn't take her again.
155,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,So bad .
156,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,very bad prof no extra credit and she didn't grade all the assignments and tests correctly. She changed the test question after I was with an A grade tfrom multiple choice to blank and even with blank I answer the question comletly right as the book but she want it as she thought to be that's not fair!! wouldn't take her class again.
157,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,"So awful very bad. If we have in the dictionary more than the word (BAD) I will say it for her. Very rude to all students. All students do not appear their faces to zoom, just audio, and she focusing on one person to take him down. Racism. Don't take her. Make a drop. I will graduate next semester but with her, she makes me disappointed. BAAAD!"
158,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,"So bad class I had take at all ever cause she's acting good at first. She changing her minds regarding the grades many time so if you were with an A your grade will skip down to C-. She is jealous and doesn't want any student to be with an A grade. She grade the assignment and tests in wrong way and not correct, not the same as the book."
159,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,I will conclude what I need to say shes let you feel stupid and disappointed Very hard not as a class but from her side yes isnt that easy Dont take her! She wasted my time I should dropped this class But I give her many chances I think Im wrong but as you see many students feel the same. Tough grader Need her answers in her own way no your way
160,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM423,1.0,5.0,"When most students in a course fail, it says more about the teacher than students. She micromanages students in areas that aren't necessary to the course. I wouldn't call her a professor; it felt like I was back in high school. She isn't even fluent in English! She struggled to explain basic concepts. Find a prof. that treats others with respect."
161,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM423,2.0,5.0,"This was the most challenging class I have ever taken and the professor was not any better. She is good with demonstrating, however the homework and quizzes only reflect less than 10% of the test. She does not provide study guides for the test. Be prepared to learn a lot but chances are high that you will fail terribly."
162,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,4.0,"Im usually really good in chem/bio, but this class was on a different level. Had to teach myself the entire semester. She was never clear on test questions (all written) and labs and marked everything wrong if not answered in her words. She makes you feel stupid if you ask a question and expects you to learn everything as soon as she goes over it."
163,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,2.0,Very difficult class
164,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,"The most difficult professor I've ever had. Disrespectful to students and very unwilling to go back and reexplain. Hypercritical on grading; will take points off in labs and exams if answers are given in ways other than what she taught. Does not explicitly explain what is asked for in test questions, then mark down for not giving what she wanted."
165,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,5.0,5.0,"I did not do too well in this class but that is due to my own personal matters. Professor Roy was helpful when you needed it, she gave everyone equal chances to be successful. She offers a study session which I couldn't go too but it seemed to really help everyone who could go. I really liked having her as a professor."
166,165706,Deboleena,Roy,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM309,1.0,5.0,"Very strict, demanding, expect you to understand everything after lecture and at times, rude to students (at the beginning and middle of the semester). It is a shame she doesn't allow recorders in class and I understand why..."
168,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP440,1.0,5.0,Very abstract instruction. Uses simple examples for lecture and does not combine concepts adequately to prepare students for his exams. Not many homework but does go over homework after due date. Does not use a textbook and his notes are not very good either.
169,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,5.0,4.0,"Professor's Youtube - Someprofs. Assembly isn't an easy concept. My uni is forcing me to retake; Tak's method is far superiors at illustrating how everything comes together. He taught me more about Computer Science than any of my professor. Be for warned though, it's difficult to get an A but even harder to NOT get a C."
170,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,4.0,Not a good teacher. Tak's explanations of material are super abstract and hard to understand. If you are not familiar with logic notation good luck. When asked questions Tak will ignore them or tell you to go back and reread the super abstract modules. If I am just going to have to teach myself then what is the point of having a Teacher????
171,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,5.0,"Do not take Tak under any circumstances. The exams make up the majority of the grade, and the material covered in lecture and in the homework does not prepare you for it at all. They're incredibly lengthy as well. Not once did I even start on the last problem of any exam. I have gotten As in every other CISP class and had to drop or get an F here."
172,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,5.0,"Avoid like the covid, expects you to spend absurd amounts of programming each day. Tests grades are random and tests are a few levels of abstraction from what he teaches in class. No text book but a few html links from what he wrote himself. it's usually unhelpful. Expects you to remember entire programs and to be able to handwright without testing"
173,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Tak is an incredible professor, he is also one of the most difficult but you have all the tools to pass his class. Not only will he work with you but he makes you work for that grade. Keep on top of his lectures and really chew on them. If you work hard in his class it will prepare you for classes ahead and make them seem easy."
174,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,5.0,"Avoid Tak at all cost. Honestly take classes with other professors or at a different Los Rios College. Due to corona this class was fully online. He wasn't helpful WHATSOEVER. If we asked him questions he would say ""We went over it, go back to canvas notes"". He explains most obvious things but never explains actually challenging material."
175,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,3.0,5.0,Very tough class. Tak makes the class easy to pass with a C being 37.5%. The first half of the class (non-programming portion) is fairly easy however it gets ridiculously hard after that. He has made his own assembly language so there will be NO online resources for you to utilize. Exams are open note however most of the time they won't help.
176,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,5.0,5.0,"Admittedly this class was stressful throughout. Tak will constantly push you and force you to think critically. Yes, at times you will be confused, but never lost. Tak provides all the material you need. Study hard and you'll gain a lot from this class. If we wish to succeed as computer scientists, we cannot afford be lazy thinkers."
177,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP440,5.0,4.0,"Tak is not a good lecturer. He takes too long to grade, and his lecture notes are subpar. BUT, one thing I did appreciate A LOT about Tak's classes is their rigor. I'll be transferring to Berkeley this fall, and out of all CS courses I took in ARC, Tak's classes were the only ones that got me on my feet. THIS outweighs all the disadvantages, IMO."
178,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,5.0,"I have always excelled in school, but I was hoping to simply pass this class, and doubting that I would the entire time. There were a select few students who were vocal and seemed to live and breathe this stuff, and he definitely catered to them at the expense of the class at large. I was so lost that I wouldnt know where to begin to ask questions"
179,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,5.0,"This class started out hard, and became impossible. He clearly has an extremely gifted mind, but he is not a good teacher. He is not outright rude, but he does make those who ask questions feel inferior, and tells them to re-watch past lectures (they are all recorded), instead of finding a new way to explain something that was not clear."
180,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,5.0,"The first half of the class he has notes that you go over in class, but when we got into the programming portion, there was no material, nothing to study, and he made up his own language, so you couldnt use google to try to find explanations either. He also did not grade any homework or the second exam before we took the final."
181,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP440,4.0,4.0,"Professor Tak is a great professor, although the lectures are a little overwhelming /heavy but if you put in the work and ask good questions you should be able to pass. He really does take forever to grade assignment but want his students to succeed. So be prepared to STUDY, I recommend with a group &amp;&amp; have your notes organized for exams."
182,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,5.0,4.0,"I took 440 and 310 with him and trust me Professor Tak is one of the best professors at ARC. I'm currently on my second semester at Berkeley studying EECS and I realize now that Professor Tak prepared me most for classes like cs70 and cs61c here. If you like CS, you will find his classes very interesting (especially 310 is amazing)"
183,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,4.0,5.0,"Check out his lectures on YouTube, someprofs . Assembly is tough. His course is hard. The only thing harder is failing his class (seriously). You needed an overall grade of something like 35% for a C. IMO, he was the most rewarding and engaging Professor I encountered at Los Rios. He opened my eyes to how much more proactive I need to be in CISP."
184,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,4.0,5.0,"I have officially transferred out and in my 2nd semester at CSUS &amp; came back to write this review. Taks class is difficult. It is a MUST that you study outside of class, however if you're taking CS seriously, I recommend taking him if you can and toughing it out. Put in the effort and I promise you will thank Tak and yourself later down the road."
185,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,4.0,4.0,"Class is difficult, especially if you struggled in 360. Reviews on here that attack character are vindictive. Professor Tak cares about his students, just go to his office hours. Compsci is a hard major, even more so after you transfer, I believe this class does a good job of preparing you."
186,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,3.0,4.0,"Can be condescending and confusing most of the time. 3 tests total 80% of your grade, 20% lab assignments. His practice tests are practically the same as the actual tests so can't complain there. Records his lectures, make sure to re-watch them or you'll get lost. No textbook for this class, a lot of self teaching. B is definitely doable, A is not"
187,137189,Tak,Auyeung,American River College,Computer Science,CISP310,1.0,5.0,No textbook only the teachers notes. These notes will not help you on a test. If you have taken CISP 430 and 440 which are not requirements of the class you will understand the notes. There is very little that you can look online except the teachers lecture on youtube(some profs). I'm never taking this professor again and do not recommend. RATING 0
189,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING and Funny! Interested in your success. Attend All classes to maximize learning experience. Makes life so much easier and fun to learn. Understanding. Tests are from Material covered in Lectures as well as book, so make sure come to class and take notes."
190,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,1.0,I took Prof Kloss over the summer and it was one of the easiest A's I've gotten. He is very caring and wants everyone to succeed. His lectures are super interesting and I would deff take him again. You won't regret taking his class!!!
191,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,1.0,Never had a professor like him before. He is hella chill and laidback. Wants everyone to succeed and get an A. A class where everyone wants to listen to what the professor says. He makes the class really light and interesting. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED.
192,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,4.0,1.0,"Professor Kloss is super cool and helpful, he makes sure everyone passes. Theres a few projects and tests but the study guides help a lot and there are clear guidelines about what he wants. He makes the class fun with cracking jokes but just be on time and do the study guides and you'll pass!"
193,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,5.0,2.0,"This class was based on a Group paper and presentation on a social problem of your choice. The professor was amazing, very helpful, gave good feedback, helped when needed and was always so understanding of anything. Very Funny and Great personality. Learning about many different social problems was very intriguing! This teacher is the best!"
194,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,2.0,His teaching abilities encouraged me to never stop learning. Hes straight to the point. If you get a bad grade its 100% your fault!
195,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,2.0,"Easy, simple, and fun class. Hilarious and caring professor, if you need Soc 300 take his class! Minimal work, easy grading, and he is very helpful. Probably the most easy going, lay back, chill professor or person in general."
196,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,2.0,"He is hilarious!!!! It was easy class. I took his summer class , it consists three exams and one major project and one class presentation. Definitely recommend!!!!!!!"
197,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,5.0,2.0,Let me just first off by saying He is a GREAT Professor. One of the qualities I enjoy much about him he is very diverse and knowledgeable. He is an understanding professor. I learned so much in this class. I gain much insight on many social problems on a Macro scale. Very community style room . Take him you wont regret it.
198,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,5.0,1.0,"One of the best professors! He is amazing and funny. One group project, make sure you pick good group members. The professor was always very helpful and always answered questions. I always looked forward to going to class."
199,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOCIOLOGY300,5.0,2.0,"Actually wanted to hear what he said not just for a grade , best class of the day"
200,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,1.0,Prof. Kloss was super easy and super fun! Lots of great group class discussions! He provides lots of opportunities for extra credit. If you are looking to have fun and succeed Kloss is your teacher!
201,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Kloss has been one of my favorite teachers so far! I always looked forward to attending his class. It was heavily focused around group projects, but I learned so much and had a great experience. Highly recommend taking him."
202,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,5.0,3.0,"Kloss is great! Would definetely take his class again. He is kind of all over the place but lenient and if you pay attention to instructions, easy pass. Group projects was a good experience"
203,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,5.0,2.0,This class seems a little bit unorganized at first because there is basically no lecture from the professor and it is actually taught by you and your classmates. But trust me you will learn a lot at the end and really get an insight of different sociological topics. You will hear stories from different people coming from different countries. Great.
204,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,5.0,1.0,"Professor Kloss is a great guy and using his artistic skills to draw you into the class. His handouts are informative, but always have his personal touch of art to grab your interest. Overall a funny guy, who is very genuine and cares about his students."
205,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,1.0,The best teacher ARC can offer. Anyone with negative comments really needs to re think about their lives. If you aren't into a teacher who rather have you learn the subject and enjoy it and you rather sit their and stress don't bother. He is more of making you enjoy the class rather then stress.
206,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,1.0,Honestly one of the best teachers I've had. Class is super easy as long as you show up! He makes sure everyone gets an A.
207,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC301,3.0,3.0,"While I enjoy this professors personality, I did not enjoy this class. Social 301 was unorganized, we were given a little Direction, there were no lectures and very little al information given aside from a few handouts. This class is essentially taught by the students. If you're looking for an easy a this might be the class for you."
208,412632,John,Kloss,American River College,Sociology,SOC300,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, take him if you can. He is fun and very nice. 3 exams and 1 fun project."
210,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI300,5.0,2.0,The class is very easy and straight to the point. Anyone can pass the class with an A if you just do the material.
211,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUITR300,5.0,2.0,"OK, I dont know how you complain about this professor. She was very nice! We had a diet project to turn in, 3 exams, and 5 quizzes. It's a 3 unit class, super easy. Download her online lecture sheets and you basically have the exam answers. I can't believe people actually complained about her work load, literally less work than my other classes."
212,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI300,3.0,3.0,Class is easy but she assigns to much work &amp; TAKES FOREVER TO GRADE..
213,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUT300,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor, she really knows her stuff! Be ready to learn a lot. Our first test was in class, the rest were taken online. She gives tons of opportunities for extra credit. She's very nice &amp; her lectures are easy to comprehend. But beware of taking A LOT of notes during class."
214,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI300,5.0,1.0,I took professor gonsalves for nutrition 300 and she was really great she is very helpful and she gives good feed back. We had a diet project and she wanted everyone to pass so if you did not pass the first try she would tell you what was wrong with it and then she would let you submit it again without penalizing you. Highly suggest you take her.
215,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUITR300,5.0,2.0,This teacher is fantastic I cannot tell you how much effort she will put in on her end for the students success. I had this teacher during the COVID19 pandemic and she made the switch to online not painful. This teacher was both excellent in the classroom and on the online lecture I am just happy to have taken the class with her!
216,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI300,2.0,3.0,"This class is fine. The teacher has a bit of an attitude. Since there are few assignments, dont miss even one because that could be a grade letter difference in the final grade in the end of semester. The online class is ok. The chapters each week are long so dont take all the notes in 1 day."
217,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUT300,5.0,3.0,"No homework, quiz on every chapter need to read your notes before taking it, first exam in class, 1 online and final online too. Everything you need to do is to take notes, she always tells what will be on the exam so make sure to write that down. Easy class just take notes!"
218,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI300,5.0,2.0,"Taking NUTRI 300 online was a nice class online because when doing it for the 8 weeks I learned a lot about Nutrition. Every week there was discussion boards and quizzes, and getting out of those assignments made it very helpful for me to learn. The class was helpful."
219,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUT300,5.0,2.0,"I took NUTR300 in Spring 19 and it was my first time taking a college course that was fully online. I enjoyed learning so much about nutrition. With weekly discussions and quizzes, I thought it would be hard but it was very manageable to get done and the work is straight forward. GREAT instructor, very responsive and helpful."
220,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUT300,3.0,2.0,"I took Prof Gonsalves Online during Spring of 2017. The structure of the online class materials were cleared and precise. Weekly quizzes, discussion boards, 1 project broken into two parts."
221,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI300,3.0,3.0,Took online class so I did not get to know her but she was somewhat responsive to emails. The class structure was really organized so not a lot of reason to email through the semester. She was understanding when I got a concussion and she cares about the success/understanding of the students. Not mind-blowingly amazing but would take again!(:
222,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI310,5.0,2.0,"NO: QUIZZES, TESTS, OR FINALS. However, there was 6 very long articles we had to read with questions we had to answer and turn in and have a class discussion about. An additional 6 assignments that was spreaded out every three weeks. One project, one country, 10-12min presentation, bringing food is optional, this will take up last 3 months of class"
223,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUT300,5.0,3.0,"Two tests, one final. One Diet Project, split into two parts. I took this course Spring 2017, one test in class, one test and final online. Her lectures will help you with the chapter study guides she has for you online. Whatever you can't find will be in the textbook. You have to read textbook unless you have good knowledge with Nutrition."
224,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUT300,5.0,1.0,She's incredible professor. I had taken her Nutrition 300 class. It was really easy class. the mostly quizzes were online and open book. Even 2 exams were open book too. I passed her class with A grade. I wanna say if you are good with your homework and assignments in her class then she's easy A grader.
225,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUITR300,2.0,4.0,"This rate is for her online course. I dont think Ive had a prof that was this strict. Technology tends to fail, or mess up and when it does, she does not care. She will still give a 0. Sadly, her clarification on stuff isnt a precise as it needs to be for an online course."
226,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTRI481,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor; learned a lot in this class that I didn't know before in an interactive way. Since it was an honors class, most of the semester was spent in seminar-style discussions so beware if you're shy. Grades were based on participation in seminars, discussion board responses, a few mini-short essay responses, and a paper/presentation."
227,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUITR300,5.0,1.0,Dr. Gonsalves is such a sweet professor. There are weekly discussion posts as well as quizzes that are due. There 2 big diet projects that are due but they are easy peazy. I would definitely take her again. I have learned a lot from this class.
228,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTR300,5.0,4.0,"As a Nursing Major, this class was a great introduction for science classes. She provides everything you need online. You must attend class to get full lecture notes. Lots of quizzes based on both the text book and lectures, but mostly lectures. She wants everyone to pass and learn something. Definitely passionate. Offers extra credit. RECOMMENDED!"
229,665985,Jana,Gonsalves,American River College,Nutrition,NUTR300,5.0,2.0,Great professor!
231,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POL301,4.0,3.0,I took his class online because of COVID and his weekly assignments weren't too much. The tests are manageable if you do the study guide. Four current event papers but they're pretty fun. Overall nice class.
232,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLI301,5.0,3.0,"Very kind professor who makes it extremely clear as to what he expects with the work. The lectures, slides, and study guide will be everything you need when it comes to exams! Attendance is mandatory but his class didn't feel as long as it actually was. I added political science as my second major because of him and his class!!"
233,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,5.0,3.0,I had a summer class so the classes were long but did not put me to sleep and he gave breaks during the class. His tests are VERY similar to his lectures and the study guide so take notes! His feedback is very clear and he sets his expectations very well-- you will know exactly what to do in order to do well in his class. He's a very nice guy too!!
234,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POL101,5.0,2.0,"Best professor Ive had at Sierra college. This class was definitely my most enjoyable gen ed and Prof Sukkary is an AWESOME lecturer and teacher all around the board. You have to read Revel in order to be successful in this class, no way around it. Gives fantastic study guides and several extra credit assignments. 100% recommend."
235,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,3.0,3.0,"Even if you get good grades on your exams, quizzes, and current event papers, he still gets upset that he couldn't babysit you for 1 hour and 20 minutes."
236,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,PLSCI301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sukkary was an AMAZING professor. I did have to take his Pols 301 class twice but both times he helped me anytime I needed it, he was easy to contact, and he gives great feedback. TO PASS THE CLASS all you need to do is STUDY, TAKE NOTES/ FOCUS DURING LECTURES, DO THE HOMEWORK, &amp; TRY TO DO ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS AHEAD OF TIME! :) Good Luck!"
237,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sukkary is very dedicated to helping his students and even actively seeks them out after class for feedback on assignments or to just check up on them. His lectures are always interesting and interactive. He has a very strict grading policy, so if you even slightly deviate from instructions, prepare to get your score docked."
238,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,4.0,3.0,"He is very picky. All small details, really matter. If you are interested in politics take this class. His lectures are interesting. However, you have to put a lot of effort to get a good grade. He is well organized and gives opportunity for at least 30 extra credit points."
239,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,4.0,4.0,Professor Sukkary is a great teacher. Class mostly contained lectures and maybe 3 group in class assignments. There are a few current event papers but he has the specific format instructions which make it easy to get 100% on those. Many revel assignments due so be prepared to have 1-3 of those due in a week.
240,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS300,5.0,3.0,He's great.
241,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,2.0,5.0,"He was kind BUT he goes over EVERYTHING that will happen in your semester on day 1, and touches on it very briefly, then excepts you to just figure it out online. The thing that left me screaming at my computer is the fact that his Reveal online tests will take anywhere from 3-4 hours to complete and they are once per week, He is also VERY picky."
242,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,5.0,3.0,"Sukkary is amazing! He expects you to act and work like a college student should, but he is a very funny and caring professor. He is a great professor if you're looking for an informative class where you will learn a lot. 4 exams, 4 essays, stay on top of the homework and you should be chill. A bit picky on essay formatting, but not too bad."
243,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,PLSCI301,3.0,4.0,Kinda strict but overall nice and easy going. I mean after all it is college and some stuff is tough
244,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,5.0,1.0,"Sukkary is an AMAZING teacher! I took this class to learn more about politics &amp; I couldn't have picked a better mentor to do it! Participation &amp; showing up on time matters. He is very thoughtful &amp; meticulous &amp; organized, he's there if you need his help &amp; he is gracefully patient. Study &amp; read &amp; you will get an A. He is the best!"
245,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sukkary is a great teacher, and his instructions are clear as is his grading criteria. He gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Do the work and participate during class and you will pass."
246,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POL301,4.0,3.0,"Professor Sukkary is a great teacher of Political Science. very knowledgeable, great at explaining the History/Politics. Made learning the History/Politics interesting and is very interactive with the class BUT there is a lot of work to do especially as a summer class (reading, online quizzes, chapter quizzes and in class exams) BUT offers E.C."
247,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLS301,3.0,4.0,Personally I was not a fan of this prof because he was somewhat condescending and didn't really make the class interesting but hey whatever. He does provide detailed study guides and is very clear on grading criteria tho I do think he is a harsh grader but that just mightve been me idk. The papers are really easy if you follow the format. Twas ok
248,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POLI301,5.0,4.0,good
249,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POL301,4.0,2.0,"Professor Sukkary is an outstanding teacher, and he makes Political Science fun! His classes are very interactive  and he requires participation to earn daily points.  He definitely covers all test material in class, but you need to take good notes.  3 Papers, 3 Tests, On-Line Book. Strict on timing, no late work, but very fair.  Expectations clear"
250,318914,Tamir,Sukkary,American River College,Political Science,POL301,4.0,3.0,"this class will challenge you, but the  professor will guide to the best of his abilities. you just have to put in the work, he drops your lowest quiz score etc... overall cool teacher he's the man you want to study under if your future leads down the political   path"
252,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISA318,1.0,5.0,"Professor is not much involved as everything is pre-set and class is online even the grades will automatically upgraded. The only thing he has to do is to reply to emails. The homework and quizzes are due on Fridays 5:00PM, could be 11:59 so it provideds another 7-8 hours, but professor wont do it. this class is not for those who work full time!"
253,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISA308,1.0,3.0,His hw is due at 5pm in Fridays so if you work figure it out. completed orientation and went to complete hw since Im balancing full time work &amp;other classes to graduate thought this online class was great-wrong. Poor way to teach someone that doesnt know. Spent money on books and wasted my money. I have 3 majors and dont understand due hisdates
254,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,4.0,4.0,The professor is excellent and gives many motivational speeches. Most of the code for assignments is written by him during class. You simply have to show your ability to apply the written code in a finished product. Because of this teaching style a lot of students get lazy and try to finish assignments last minute. Those are the students who fail.
255,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,5.0,3.0,If u dont like coding-to-learn and you dont understand CS logic dont take this class. Else if u dont mind teaching yourself a few new tricks and being tested on very clear criteria. This is a great class. You dont need the book. But I do recommend one for C++. (My 360 one was enough). You must attend class and should code in class. Finals cake
256,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CIS308,5.0,3.0,"Pretty easy class. Just download his powerpoints and notes, as you can have them available to you for your quizzes and exams, which are weekly (5-week course). The only issue I had is that once you answer a question, make sure thats your final answer as you can't go back to change the answer. Two projects and a 100 question final exam."
257,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CIS308,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this class, everything is online and kinda figure it out and go fudge yourself. But to be honest youre going to brain dump everything that you have learned. Quizes are difficult and hardly can be found online even you read the book. I'd rather watch tutorials on youtube. #worstonlineclassever."
258,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,1.0,4.0,"I would not take his classes unless you already know the material, because he will not help you. He must expect everyone to already know the subject he teaches because he always acts surprised when the class cannot answer a question and will proceed to mock us for it, although he will help you 1 on 1 he makes it feel like pulling teeth."
259,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISA308,2.0,1.0,"Took 5week CISA308 &amp; 318 online classes and it was VERY EASY. Just do 5 assignments, quizzes, and exams! Quizzes were challenging only because he provides you with an irrelevant ppt. Read the book and download all five presentations to answer each quiz. Save money buying the program by itself online, use a computer with Microsoft already in it."
260,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,4.0,3.0,"Here's the one thing you need to know about Fox. If you don't ask questions you wont get answers. He gives you plenty of time to do the assignments but since students tend to put things off, they start it late and have a hard time. Don't do this. Start your homework early, ask him questions about it and he'll be happy to answer."
261,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,1.0,5.0,"Simply, he is the worst instructor in ARC. He cannot even teach you a single code. He thinks that all students are experts and they should know everything that he knows. Talks about cringy stories about the 90 percent of class and in the other 10 percent just write some code and doesn't explain any of that. Just Ignore him."
262,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP300,5.0,1.0,He is really easy for CISP 300 take it with him you are going to get an easy A.
263,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CIS308,4.0,2.0,"I took CISC 308 &amp; CISA 308, I learned from the book mostly but he is a fair grader on the projects he assigned. Just do the work on time. Dont miss anything he doesnt accept any late work. All quizzes are only one attempt but you have plenty of time. One thing I noticed is the answers are not always right in his presentations. I RECOMMEND."
264,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP300,4.0,2.0,I dont understand why some people are so negative. Fox isnt really a tough grader nor a bad professor. He assigns easy projects that you should know how to do if you go to class and tests arent hard either. He also loves to help people inside and outside of class. The only downside are his terrible jokes. TLDR: GO TO CLASS AND PAY ATTENTION 4 A
265,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,5.0,3.0,"Fox is one interesting old dude, but he definitely knows his code. Sometimes he messes up in his code, but he has really funny subtle jokes. His projects were easy but took some self studying to do, because his lectures aren't that good, but if you talk to him directly, he can help you! I would definitely take him again."
266,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,4.0,4.0,"Professor Fox is a good professor, just not for me. I felt his teaching style didn't mesh well with my learning style. I could've put in more effort but his lectures weren't interesting to me and I didn't enjoy programming as usual. Homework felt a little overwhelming. Accessible outside of class and very knowledgeable in computer programming."
267,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISA308,3.0,4.0,"He's not a bad professor but if you could take someone else, I suggest you do. Some of the questions on his exams are not in his lecture notes or in the book which was really annoying. His hw assignments and some projects are pretty easy though."
268,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,5.0,4.0,"Lots of ppl wait til the last sec to do the work, don't do that here. The book had a lot of good info but it is tough at first. You will learn as much as you care to learn. Do extra reading on your own. Grading is pretty detail heavy. He is a bit unhelpful with questions. He can be grumpy at times too but he's a nice guy. Don't skip class."
269,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CISP400,2.0,4.0,"His teaching style is minimalist at best. Class consisted of 50 minutes of random banter and 20-30 minutes of coding. Graded on 7 projects, midterm and final so if you miss one, you can pretty much drop a letter grade overall. Project and exams consist of him writing out some code and you copying it. Deducts tons of points for mistakes."
270,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CIS318,1.0,5.0,"Lacks the mental capacity on how to use add codes and manage his class body. Students add his class, the class starts, and he will not add more than the default number of students (so don't bother Waitlist), then drops a lot of students once you're a week in, so he ends up teaching maybe 15 students and gets paid in full. Quite interesting."
271,150275,David,Fox,American River College,Computer Science,CIS308,1.0,5.0,These three cisa 308 cisa 318 and cisc 308 classes were harder than 5 of my 3 unit GE classes combined. Quizzes are only 1 attempt and the questions dont match up to the lecture notes. Lots of stupid hypothetical questions such as: microsoft word was the first word proccessor true or false? its almost impossible to find out if microsoft was first!!
273,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENG302,1.0,5.0,The most specific and picky teacher I have ever taken he gives so many specific mandatory requirements for papers it's impossible to get perfect. He's a very nice person to talk to but he made me cry daily his class is so incredibly stressful. Worst teacher I've had in my entire life. Do not take him unless it's a last resort.
274,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR300,5.0,3.0,"Valle is a great professor, you have literally everything to write available for you. the rest is up to you, do bad, its on you not him. You also have plenty of time for each essay. It takes more effort to fail that it does to pass if you simply follow directions."
275,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENG301,1.0,5.0,"Time consuming! More work than my 3 other classes combined. Very hard teacher, I am an excelled writer and this class was STRESSFUL and frustrating! His strict outlines give no room for personal thinking or creativity, very difficult to find flow in writing. Books are interesting reads though. Would say more but I'm limited: be prepared to WORK!"
276,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR302,5.0,4.0,"Professor Valle is a once in a lifetime professor. He assigns a lot of work with specific expectations but if you just follow the directions you will be fine. Communicate with him and he will help. The skills I learned in his course will absolutely help me in the future; well worth the work. Plus, he is truly cares about each student!"
277,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Valle keeps you updated on grading, reading assignments and on any changes to the course. In the 6 weeks we had of this online course, he was very specific as to what he looks for in a paper and a discussion post. Excellent feedback and a great instructor to have."
278,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENG302,2.0,4.0,"This 6-week class felt like a full time job. I was doing homework almost all day every day. The types of formats he had us use for papers were ridiculous. I have never taken an English class with so many weird rules for papers. I recommend not taking as a summer class. A regular length class should be ok. He looks for completion, not perfection."
279,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR302,5.0,4.0,"Prof Valle shoots from the hip. He won't hold your hand, yet when you email him for specifics, he is very open to make sure you understand what is being asked without giving up the bank. I learned allot, I mean allot, more than I expected!"
280,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR302,1.0,5.0,This professor is purposely making this class hard as heck. He mixes his instructions from one to the other. I'm having to email tons of times just to get clearance of his instructions. I know I'm going to fail this class. I'm hanging in there. Stay away!
281,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGRW302,3.0,4.0,"4 books, 2 documentaries, 3 papers, weekly online discussion minimums, Facebook group activity heavy and a 24 hour final paper. Tough class. Good readings. Professor Valle is not great at giving feedback or providing clear instructions. Ask questions frequently and take advantage of his open door/email policy."
282,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR302,3.0,4.0,"The key to this class is to put your critical thinking skills into overdrive. Valle does NOT hold your hand and will make you work for it. He provides everything you need to know in the writing core, so follow directions carefully. He is highly responsive to questions, but you have to ask the right questions. He requires you to master the methods."
283,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,EMGWR300,5.0,4.0,"Will change your mind and perspective about the world. Tough class but no said college was going to be easy. Couple classmates did like him because of the amount of work assigned; however, I used what I learned in class in other class and in my everyday life. WORTH THE WORK"
284,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENG301,1.0,5.0,He has unreasonable expectations. he says if he asks for 5 sources on an essay and you give 4 then you get a 0 on the assignment. if he asks for 1833 words and you give 1800 then 0. oh and if you get any zeros on any assignments then you fail the course. not to mention he requires wayyyyyy too many discussion posts and video posts. smdh
285,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENG301SUMMER,1.0,5.0,"Gave a lot hw: discussion (4-250 wrd post per set of readings and 4-250 word replies) 4-3000 wrd essays of which there are strict formats per body &amp; sentence used it must be labeled (body P1  narration, opening statement, etc...) Don't follow these rules, you get away with it the first time, after that  0% Not effective teaching methods, avoid!"
286,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR302,3.0,3.0,"He is actually not that bad. I hated him at the beginning of the semester because he seemed very mean. He is very blunt and boring. His topics for essays are all liberal and political. I didn't even read the books, though, and I got an A. I went to his office hour, and he is actually pretty nice and cool. He is very willing to help you. Just ask."
287,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,EMGWR300,4.0,4.0,"I really recommend this teacher, it might be hard but is worth it."
288,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGRW302,4.0,5.0,"Prof states in syllabus that 15-20 hrs/wk during summer is required for this course; I spent about 25 hrs on avg. Heavy reading, very specific writing assignments. Follow his instructions carefully and you'll do fine. While it was one of the hardest writing courses I've taken, the skills &amp; knowledge I've come away with are second to none."
289,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR301,2.0,4.0,"Summer class. He made us rely on d2l and FB what's going on with assignments. Proff. unclear with HOW to label sentences in essays... (Oh you have to label almost each stentence you write in an essay) because if you don't the first time he'll let it slide (with a low grade), the second time he'll automatically give you a 0 (zero). lazy prof."
290,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENG302,3.0,3.0,"Very fast paced class for a 6 week summer course. Professor only grades essays based on his format- he doesn't care about logic or analysis as much. As long as you write essays based on his format to a T- you'll get good grades. But, his explanations are frustrating and doesn't give enough information on assignments. Often responds with Y/N answer."
291,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,ENGWR301,1.0,5.0,"Super dry personality, acts like students are stupid for asking questions. I took the online portion and he won't respond to questions and if he does its non explanatory like just a yes or no."
292,170960,Jesus,Valle,American River College,English,EMGWR300,4.5,4.0,"Professor Valle is a very intelligent man. He is very well knowledged on various subjects and projects this onto his students. He is a tough grader but very helpful. He really cares for the success and progress of his students, but it is your responsibility to approach him. I learned A LOT and loved writing by taking his class."
294,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,2.0,4.0,"This class is DIFFICULT. It will make you second guess your major and your future. His exams are extremely difficult with not enough time imo to complete them. Advise not to take this class with any others if you have to pass. I mean pass with a C. Doesnt curve grades, doesnt drop lowest exam score. The grade you get is the grade you earn. BEWARE."
295,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,3.0,5.0,Exams are DIFFICULT with a short amount of time to take. I studied 35 hours a week for this class and it still isnt enough. Does not curve grades. Lab reports are LENGTHY. You can learn A LOT in this class but if you expect to get an A or even a B YOU HAVE TO WORK. If youre not a chem major get a chem tutor if you have to have an A in this class.
296,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,1.0,3.0,"Took his class for CHEM 400 online and it was the worst decision. He would constantly accuse all the students of cheating and would rant about this for half of the lecture. Super heavy on homework and lab work, this class plus all the other ones I was taking, it was very hard to keep up."
297,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM310,1.0,5.0,"The worst chem professor ever. He threatens students in all aspects especially with grades, and is very disrespectful. Overlooks questions when theyre asked and is just completely rude. Seems like he doesnt want anyone to be successful and lets ppl figure it out for themselves. Take him if you want to be disrespected and threatened."
298,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,1.0,5.0,"He gives A LOT of questions on the exam and doesn't provide enough time to get them done. He also complains about students cheating, but students wouldn't have to cheat if he provided sufficient explanations for how to solve chem problems. Overall, don't be fooled by the positive ratings. I can assure you, chem 400 is not an easy class."
299,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,5.0,3.0,"Mike Payne is one of the best teachers I've had sure I dropped his class mainly due to me not studying enough because his class was tough. Overall he gives lots of practice which will make you learn your stuff, I did not take advantage of this and surely will next time."
300,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM310,2.0,4.0,Don't take his summer course! Prof. Payne isn't a bad lecturer but lectures are very long. 2 big problems: Prof. Payne is not very tech savvy class is fully online this causes the student a lot of stress. He did not grade one paper until after the second test. How can you fix your mistakes if you don't know you're making them? Had to drop :(
301,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,2.0,4.0,Gave useful lectures but he's a harsh grader. He also changed his syllabus right before finals so a lot of people failed the class. There was a lot of homework but there were extra credit opportunities. He printed the notes for students so that was helpful. There was a lot of homework and the lab reports took hours.
302,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM310,2.0,5.0,Professor Payne is extremely disorganized and terrible at explaining Chemistry. This class is supposed to be a basic introduction to Chem. He goes into it already thinking that some of the more complex chemistry is common sense. Avoid at all costs! Take Chem in the spring semester or over summer instead. Because he will threatens you about Dean.
303,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM310,5.0,4.0,"Three tests, one final, a few labs, homework/assignments for every chapter, and extra credit. Everything you learn in the class is on YouTube, but Payne also explains the material well and clears up any uncertainty. Nomenclature and dimensional analysis are a must-know. Not an easy A, but neither is chemistry; it's yours if you study. Good luck!"
304,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM310,5.0,2.0,He is an outstanding teacher. He is very detailed with his lecture and makes sure everyone understands the material. Though he is very strict with his rules and attendance he wants to make sure all his students succeed. Highly recommend this professor if you are willing to put a good amount of work.
305,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,5.0,3.0,Mike is a great professor. I would definitely take him again. I took him for Chem 310 over the summer before I took Chem 400. He really cares and wants you to learn. He'll blame himself if overall class did bad on exams. He wants to you participate in class .He is very stern in what he does and assigns. Lots of HW. Office hours are best.
306,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,5.0,5.0,"Just because u hear good reviews on him doesn't mean this class will be easy. He makes u work for an A even a B. If you're taking this class this Fall '20 during COVID-19, participate, ask questions, he's glad to answerquestions! You guys have an advantage, rewatch lec/lab recordings, that helped me pass. Make this class your 1st priority, no joke."
307,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,5.0,3.0,"Best professor ever. There are 4 exams, 1 final, with lots of homework and lab reports. Also gives EC. DO IT! That's what helped me get the A in the end. Study the practice tests he gives and homework to do well on exams. Exam 1, 2, 4 aren't bad, but exam 3 was harder. We went online halfway thru semester. REWATCH THE LECTURES, it will help 100%."
308,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher, hard class. You have GOT to be in every class to pass. STUDY NOMENCLATURE.... I can't stress that enough, but overall, great class, he does his best to make lectures fun and we transitioned to online due to COVID-19 but he made it a lot less stressful than i thought."
309,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,2.0,3.0,Didn't round my 79.6% to B. Says a lot.
310,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,5.0,4.0,Lab reports are time consuming but a really cool guy and it shows during lectures.
311,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,5.0,3.0,Chemistry is a hard class if you come in to it thinking you wont have to work you wont do well. I had Mike for my 2nd Chemistry class at American River and he changed my whole perspective on Chem around. I 100% recommend him. He helped me so much and I'm doing great in my 401 class because of his preparation. Thank you Mike for your love of chem!
312,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM310,5.0,3.0,Mike is an amazing professor. You will be lucky to have him as a chemistry teacher. The class is difficult because it's chemistry but if you fully commit and put in the work you can pass. Be ready to study because the test are hard.. again because it's chemistry.
313,1310797,Mike,Payne,American River College,Chemistry,CHEM400,5.0,4.0,"Payne is a great professor who wants his students to succeed and makes sure to provide any needed help. But this class requires so much time to study all the chem material, so get ready to spend most of your time studying and doing homework."
315,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,5.0,Absolutely the worst history teacher to take. Stay away and save your gpa by taking someone else. Shes great at making simple content such as history more difficult than what it actually his. Youll learn nothing about the interesting facts and events and have to memorize more on politics and city states (boring)
316,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,3.0,"She likes just to lecture not answering any question. All you would receive in her class is anxiety, despising, discourages."
317,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,1.0,"This class is lecture heavy and if you skip more than 2. Lasses, she will drop you. Tardiness is not accepted either, she will still drop you. Her class is much easier if you stay on top of the reading, but its easy to fall behind due to the density of her content."
318,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,5.0,She may be a good person but definitely not a good teacher. She likes to show presentations and lecture. The unfortunate part of taking her class is that she does not like answering questions rather she assumes that everyone knows what she knows. To pass her class you will have to study on your own.
319,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300WESTCIV,1.0,5.0,"Garasanin is a very knowledgable person and very passionate; however, the downside is she does not know how to teach. So what does she know how to do? She knows how to belittle the students and criticize us when we do not know the answer to her question. Would I recommend her? NO! unless you want to experience anxiety after every class you attend."
320,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,3.0,"She is an exemption in California education system I believe. All you get from her is discouraging, disrespect, humiliation and show off"
321,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300WESTCIV,4.0,5.0,Unfortunately because of the subject of this course this Professor makes the best effort with the heavy lectures. NO easy task for sooo much information that we must learn. The class will seem long and boring at times. She does provide powerpoint slides to print out. The book is definitely required. Tests are heavy with information from the slides.
322,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,5.0,"She seems like an entitled professor, knowing that i'm at a COMMUNITY college, not Harvard treats us adults like Kindergarten grade, will roast you if you ask common questions or answer the wrong questions, and really just stright up boring. Don't take her and waste your money, I fought and still lost (i dropped out)"
323,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIS307,1.0,5.0,Dont take her class unless its the only class youre taking this semester. She thinks shes teaching a masters degree class and she gets super insecure and upset with the class when they cant answer questions in class.
324,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIS307,1.0,5.0,"I took her in Spring 2016 and this was the hardest class I ever took! She turns off the lights and does power point the entire time in a monotone voice, so it gets boring fast. God forbid if you yawn, sneeze/cough to much, look at the clock or even have your phone go off because she will go off on you and send you out and mark you absent. Dont take"
325,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,5.0,4.0,"Great at making history come alive. She is always on time and prepared. Don't fall asleep, it's disrespectful and also you will be sent out early and marked absent. Is a fare and intelligent woman. Worth the time and money"
326,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,5.0,"She talks for an hour, and if you don'y understand you are in trouble. She won't cover part of the information that will be on the test, whole sections she says you need to read in the book, and read online, where she posted."
327,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,4.0,5.0,She is a an extremely tough Professor. She is very thorough with her lectures. There is a lot of information that you need to know. She posts the do-at-home exams that are really hard. Can't be late whatsoever. No eating food in class. Sleeping or Texting? Suspended. Leave in the middle of class? Absent. Two absences or two late times? Dropped.
328,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIS307,1.5,5.0,She grades tough and when a student asks questions she talks down at them if you cough or yawn she snaps at you and treats you like you've done something heinous  or god forbid you phone accidentally goes off she'll immediately kick you out of the class attendance matters and she only lectures on boring power points the whole time
329,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.5,5.0,Assigns no homework and the test do not reflect subject matter that was discussed in class.
330,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST305,3.5,4.0,"I took this Professor for Hist. 305 and it was nothing more than interesting. She is tough, but fair on how she treats her students. If you tend to miss a lot of class then this is not the professor for you. She holds everyone accountable for learning the syllabus, so there is no excuses. Overall I learned a lot and don't regret the class."
331,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST305,1.0,5.0,"I have never done a rate my professor  for as long as I have been at ARC.  I felt compelled to do one on this professor because I feel that people need to be forewarned before you settle for a incomplete.   When I take classes I do it to learn, this class was horrible, hard to understand and I felt completely disrespected when asking a question. "
332,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,4.0,5.0,"Taking this class in the summer is not recommanded. Too much to cover in 6 weeks. Subject very interesting, teacher very helpful if you go ask her for explanations, but yes it is hard class."
333,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.5,5.0,"This is the HARDEST class I've ever taken even though this is a summer class. If your not willing to spend hours studying the material over and over again , the tests and the extra-credit quizzes will be nearly IMPOSSIBLE to pass or even get points on. She also will have you do a 5 page minimum essay during the middle of the semester. GOOD LUCK"
334,163237,Olivera,Garasinin,American River College,History,HIST300,1.0,5.0,Class was way too hard. Sat up front and was falling asleep because of how bad it was. Wish I checked here first before I picked the class. Just horrible. Seriously horrible. HARDEST class I have ever taken
336,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,2.0,1.0,"Honestly, I am genuinely surprised that the Los Rios community college system continues to allow Professor Brozovich to continue teaching. Let's just start from the top: yeah, everything you've read or heard on campus about how easy his class is is true. However, he spouts conspiracy nonsense and during the pandemic actually just stopped teaching"
337,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,5.0,1.0,VERY EASY! all you do is show up and the test are extremely easy. All he does is gives lecture that are all about the meaning of the art and he tells you what is on the test. Take him instead of any other art history professor.
338,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,5.0,1.0,"Ok, here we go. He is a super cool person, real and raw, cracks some jokes. His class was an easy A. It was a breath of fresh air from my other classes. If you are an Art major yeah I wouldn't take his class but for GE purposes best professor. Midterm is optional, final in class. I would take him again, no assignments, no quizzes. Easy A for GE"
339,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ART300,1.0,1.0,"if you're an art major -- do NOT take. you won't learn about art. just his personal political preferences no matter how interesting they are, they don't pertain to the class one bit. upside to non art majors is that there was just the final. he gave us a take home midterm but strongly advised against doing it; so none of us did."
340,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ART300,1.0,1.0,"I learned NOTHING about art. Talked old politics from previous american presidents; sometimes art but it was always the same 5-8 artists. He yelled at the class once for leaving ""early"" bc he forgot what time the class was out. 1 test at the last class, only needed to show up to that to pass. I would be very unprepared to take the next artH class."
341,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTHI300,5.0,2.0,"All I have to say is, this is the best as it gets. Pretty easy to get a good grade, hes an interesting and fun professor. If you dont like his class, theres seriously something wrong with you. Just saying."
342,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,4.0,3.0,"His class will make you think for yourself and not what the media or society will have you thinking. His class is about looking at art and seeing the meaning behind it. Its very inspirational. Downside, hes not very approachable and he doesnt like being called Professor"
343,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ART300,5.0,1.0,dude this class is a gem. hes a good teacher. if you do all your work you get an A but you gotta do all of the work.
344,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ART300,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor, really helps you think about things from a very unusual standpoint. He makes sure that he implements the understanding of critical thinking. Usually connects Art to political and life issues. Amazing class, easy A. Just come to class, pay a little attention and you will remember everything on the final. Just come and enjoy!"
345,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,5.0,1.0,"He's a really interesting and liberal professor. I loved his lectures because they were so eye-opening. I learned so much about the government. He still lectures about art, but he intertwines many themes and analyzes the several layers of artwork. His goal is that you become a critical thinker not a memorizer. Little work required for this class."
346,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,5.0,1.0,"you have to take this class. listen to his perspective. he goes over different types of art. just know the general theme of the class. optional midterm and mandatory open book final. you need to remember painting but he will give you the answers to the final so just come listen to him, be open-minded and get A"
347,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ART300,1.0,2.0,"This class is about conspiracy theories concerning the government killing various people and other nefarious actions: The Kennedys, Martin Luther King Jr., Vietnam war, middle east military activities, killing a million children in Iran, etc. The class is mostly about posters and antiwar photos. Not much about art."
348,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ART300,5.0,1.0,SO EASY!!! MUST TAKEE!!! so freaken easy. Show up sign your name and listen to his eye opening lectures. I would so take him again. You have a final and a small little assignment. So easy! and his class is very eye opening. I can honestly say he's a conspiracy theorist professor.
349,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,5.0,2.0,"His lectures are very eye opening and interesting! He doesn't take tests seriously and the final is based off of your understand of the subject as a whole, and also your opinions on specific pieces. He is really a great down to earth professor. If I was an art major I would take him for the rest of my academic career!"
350,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,3.0,1.0,"He's very passionate about conspiracy theories... and art kind of.  He lectures in a dark classroom, just sit back and relax and enjoy your A."
351,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,3.0,1.0,Very easy class. All you have to do is show up. He passes around attendance at the end of class. All he does is lecture the whole class in a dark classroom. He cancelled the midterm and the final was pretty easy. We had to write 2 paragraphs about album cover art of our choice due the day of the final. Talks about tons of conspiracy theories.
352,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,5.0,1.0,This was the easiest A! We didn't have a midterm just one homework assignment and the final. I reccomend not taking this as a three hour class and breaking it up two days a week instead because he lectures in the dark the whole time so it seems extra long. Overall a good class and entertaining. I'd take another one of his classes I liked it.
353,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,2.0,2.0,"1/5 of the lectures were about 9/11 and American wars. No joke, the last few lectures of the semester were all about conspiracy theories.  He's a bit rude and doesn't give very clear instructions. The only upside was that he was forgetful and forgot to give us our midterm.  The final was really easy. Just come to class and take half-decent notes."
354,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,1.0,1.0,"Awful teacher. All he does is talk about his controversial ideas. If you have strict beliefs and like to debate then DO NOT TAKE. He kept ranting about how terrible the American government is. Sure he's easy, but he just talked about conspiracy theories. Nothing with points until the final exam. Not worth it, wanted to skip each class."
355,357894,Thomas,Brozovich,American River College,Fine Arts,ARTH300,1.5,1.0,"Show up to class and you'll know what's on the midterm and final. The grading curve is amazing! I think an A on the midterm was 75%. Only had one 2 paragraph assignment to turn in. Some days I thought his lecture was ridiculous, while other days I found them informative. If you want the easy A, take his class!"
357,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.0,3.0,"Took it online. She gives you a week to read every chapter. The book is very easy to read and pretty self- explanatory. No lectures. Exam every 3 chapters. Homework is due before the exam day. Discussion posts are easy, 1 per 3 chapters. 3 quizzes total, 5 exams, with the lowest being dropped for both. Homework becomes optional for exam#4 &amp; 5."
358,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302304,5.0,3.0,Professor Chen is by far one of the best professors I have taken at ARC. She is respectful and kind to all her students. She emails back in less than 24 hours and helps you out. I didn't think I liked economics until I took her class. Her assignments are straight forward and quizzes and exams are based on the book and her powerpoints and notes.
359,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,3.0,"Shes really understanding as a professor to her students. I really like her teaching style. She has been a professor since years, so shes super knowledgeable. Shes kind of old fashion because she does everything on the board. Study for quizzes. However, exams and homework and online ($$)!"
360,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.0,5.0,"Professor Chen uses an online source where you can access all of the homework assignments and thats where you will take the exams. The homework is easy and straight forward, but the tests were extremely difficult, but luckily you can take them online at home so you have the power of google. Other than those assignments she gives group projects."
361,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,3.0,"She makes it very easy to understand, and the homework is through connect and is very simple and easy to understand. She does have a small accent but she repeats things so you wont miss anything. She does have a textbook but as long as you just go over it you should be fine. Highly Recommend!"
362,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,3.0,"Her lectures are wonderful, she makes sure she repeats herself twice before asking if anyone has questions. Everything is mainly online and as long as you pay attention in class/do the exercises, and do the reading you should do well on the tests. The material can be hard but if you communicate with her she'll help you if you get confused."
363,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.0,3.0,"Professor Chen is so sweet. She is understanding and even though her accent is heavy, she is very understanding and knowledgeable about economics. Her tests are online and I had a B in the class for most of the class until the end where it dropped to a C, but she bumped it up to a B... She's so sweet, highly recommend !"
364,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302304,5.0,3.0,"She is a very good professor, she uses McGraw-Hill for homework and exams. Quizzes and group works are done in person. Her lectures and quizzes are easy to understand, but for exams, prepare yourself from reading the text multiple times. They are really hard concept questions, and also try to relate it to the real-world in order to memorize."
365,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,3.0,"I took her class in summer, it's not an easy class but u could learn a lot. She is a very patient person, she can use many examples to solve my confusion. If u want to learn something, you can choose her. Every exam has 50 problems, but u do have many chances on extra credits and group working."
366,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302304,5.0,3.0,"Professor Chen is awesome! You have to put in the effort to get a good grade but she's super clear in her expectations. Her lectures and real world examples help you understand the content. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed. I would take classes with her again in the future, for sure."
367,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,1.0,4.0,"Taken over summer, first mistake, there isn't enough room to describe the frustration of her teaching methods. So ill use one example, the homework questions are phrased differently than explained in class and when looking at the book for clarification it'll be a different formula than was given, you cannot see what you answered wrong after ur done"
368,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302304,4.0,3.0,Easy class if you show up and pay attention. She is a prof that will drop your lowest grade so that's a plus. She does have an accent but nothing major. There are group assignments but overall easy class
369,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,2.0,2.0,"Easy class. Uninspired professor. She's been teaching this same course for 20 years and it shows in how much she cares about what she's doing. I haven't read a word of the textbook all semester and I have an A. I'm interested in business and econ, but the way she teaches makes me feel dejected about it. She just repeats definitions over and over."
370,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON300,5.0,3.0,Professor Chen is awesome. Tests and homework are all online. Make sure to read your textbook before the test because the tests are mainly from the reading. Professor Chen helps a lot when you ask and is very thorough even though she has a Chinese accent. I would totally take her class again!
371,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON1A,3.0,3.0,"Difficult to understand her at times but if you have questions, just ask her. She knows everything. The textbook was only mandatory because of the online code used was included with the book, all homework/tests were online"
372,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302,1.0,5.0,Worst professor. She has an accent and does not speaks up enough. You have to read a book before each class. You must care your textbook in class because during the group work I would need it. All tests online. She does not give real examples. Do not waste your time. Take somebody else.
373,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,4.0,3.0,"There's a curve at the end, definitely. But you really need to stay on top of your grade to be sure that you'll get the grade you're aiming for. She's very kind, and makes the material easy to understand if you pay attention during class. This class wasn't necessarily an easy A but you don't have to reach TOO far to get it. Would take again."
374,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON304,3.0,3.0,"Her class is honestly kind of boring and drawn out. She's a good professor if you put effort towards actually learning. I'm not a business major but I needed micro for my major, so naturally I did not care to really push for that A but I still got a B through minimal effort. Just don't skip class and you're good."
375,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON302304,5.0,2.0,"Professor Chen is a great professor, I took her for Econ 302 and 304. The tests are difficult, but if you do well on the quizzes and homework  then you will pass. We only used the textbook in class twice. If you can study well with an ebook, don't buy the loose leaf. You will receive the ebook included with the connect code."
376,173215,Chiuping,Chen,American River College,Economics,ECON300,3.0,3.0,She is a really nice older asian woman who is very difficult to understand because of her thick accent. Her class is basically online. All the homework and tests are done online. What makes this class difficult is that majority of the stuff on tests is not learned in class you have to read it on your own. She drops worst test and quiz.
378,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,4.0,3.0,"As long as you do your HW and do well on your exams you will pass. Online assignments were very easy, worksheets took a little more time but were not that difficult. Proctored Exams count for 50% of your grade so definitely study."
379,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302,3.0,4.0,"This guy is not motivated to teach in my opinion. There is a good amount of online homework, the tests are pretty difficult.. even for prepared students. There is a study guide (helpful) ... but there is a lot of information to be covered. If you're late to class, he'll ask you to leave. Not horrible, but better options that care more."
380,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,2.0,"This African dude definitely has charisma! He loves to talk about his travelings and different countries all the time. He knows his stuff very good. He does not go by the book, and uses real life examples. Honestly, he is super straight forward about everything. You won't see any ""surprises"" on the exam. If you has interest in Economics take him!"
381,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,1.0,5.0,"Most frustrating teacher ever! Never take her! I am an A student that wont pass this class. Does not do anything to help students. Have to buy the book and do all assignments online without any direction. The formulas are not in the book, only vocabulary. If taken online she requires that you be reordered during your assignments."
382,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,5.0,2.0,Really wonderful and helpful professor I have ever seen in my college career.
383,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,3.0,"Homework consists of occasional uploaded worksheets/papers, watching videos and answering questions pertaining to the video, then completing an online assignments. 6 quizzes, spaced out about every 2-3 weeks. Midterm and Final exam are proctored and open book! :) Thoroughly enjoyed his class!"
384,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,3.0,Funny stories and overall great teacher! I learned a ton
385,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302,3.0,4.0,"he's a good teacher, good at lectures, but I wish he was more organized. really makes you work for the grade. If you're not an econ or business major it'll be hard to understand the concepts and he doesn't make it any easier. He always asks if you have any questions, but I never asked because I never knew what I didn't know, I was always confused."
386,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,1.0,3.0,"Of all the professors I have had, Professor Kinuthia is the most unorganized - the grading criteria is always changing, the textbook doesnt grade properly, the PowerPoint notes hardly make sense, and the professor doesnt respond to emails. Please beware even if you do all of the homework, the last final is a guessing game."
387,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,5.0,3.0,"I loved this professor so much, I'm actually taking him again for more economics courses. His online class relatively easy to navigate, and you will do just fine if you only use the online textbook. The final exams (multiple choice and 2 attempts!), consists using your webcam so as long as you don't cheat (don't), you'll do just fine."
388,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,4.0,3.0,"Good Prof. I think he's still getting used to teaching online, sometimes isn't very clear, but its obvious he knows his stuff. Weekly assignments are reasonable, didn't use the text much. He's kindof a slow grader, but fair. My only complaint is that his exams are worth 50% of the final grade, and you're on webcam,if you get nervous, you won't pass"
389,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302AND304,4.0,3.0,"I have take 2 online classes with Professor K. Very fair grader. He does take a little bit of time to respond to emails, but when he does hes definitely on it. The course is pretty straight forward, and he contacts you immediately if anything changes. He offers extra credit, which is great, and I would definitely take another class with him."
390,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON304,3.0,2.0,The course was pretty straightforward. There were some complicated concepts but for being an online class I received email responses quickly. There's a decent amount of homework to do each week but it isn't too difficult and the grading is fair.
391,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302,5.0,2.0,"Here's the thing, this is an easy class if you are willing to put the work in - meaning, you do all of the connect assignments and the weekly worksheets. There are 6 quizzes in this course that are 20 multiple choice questions long, a mid-term and final exam that are 50 multiple choice questions long. I did not use the textbook, just the connect."
392,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON304,2.0,4.0,"Kinuthia tries to be a jokster, but actually just discusses his personal life so often that your lecture is only 20 mins out of the 120 mins class period. He is EXTREMELY LOUD - yells everything, claps his hands and an earthquake occurs. He rushes through the material then gets pissed when the class doesn't receive all A's. Don't take him."
393,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON304,5.0,3.0,"Took him over the summer, not too bad. Quizzes are worksheets on the previous lessons. Quizzes help prepare for the exams which are multiple choice/written. Good professor, tells funny stories, clear on what will be tested."
394,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,5.0,3.0,"Really great professor. He keeps lectures interesting by using various visuals and teaching techniques, including real world examples. If you pay attention, the subject isn't too hard, though if you miss a day you will feel very behind."
395,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECN304,1.0,4.0,"Took the online Econ 304 course, If you need feedback or anything for that matter this would not be the Professor for you!  This Professor won't EVER get back to you.  Consider this Professor the ""Absentee Professor"" because you'll never hear from him nor will you ever get any a feedback."
396,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302,4.0,4.0,Really great professor. Lectures are connected to actual economic events occuring the world. Quizzes are  straight from the lecture so just memorize. 3 exams for them study the books and lectures. Group work in cooperated in lecture. Book is helpful in class but all must purchase and access for which you receive the hw and book. You have to work!!
397,180252,Kamau,Kinuthia,American River College,Economics,ECON302AND304,5.0,1.0,Very cool professor. Test are straightforward if your pay attention to the lecture and read the textbook. Take him.
399,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,1.0,2.0,"RUDE!! Does not care about his students and does not help in any way shape or form- like actually, not over exaggerating and this is coming from a student that actually cares about doing their work and school. Avoid taking him if you could."
400,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,2.0,3.0,"Gave off a rude Demeanor, his notes in canvas and every assignment was not organized it was all just placed in grades which made things difficult , and his notes were horrible . Nothing matched up to quizes and he didnt provide any helpful Information in sed notes ."
401,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART300,2.0,5.0,"COVID 19 UPDATE: DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS, not an EASY A! His quizzes and exams are easy to pass and fail. 1 question is like 25pts(T or F/multiple choice). Since there's no canvass you have to message him and ask your current standings. HE won't TELL YOU IF YOU'RE PASSING or FAILING. Tbh, I didn't learn anything from him."
402,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,1.0,4.0,"Rudest professor Ive ever had to encounter. When asked to clarify wether he received my email &amp; to get clarification on my grade, he said he isnt obligated to respond to anyones emails nor provide grade checks. But hes a professor? Rude, doesnt communicate well either. Not my prof of choice, but he took over our class after another prof. 0/5."
403,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART320,1.0,3.0,DO NOT TAKE. Projects are extremely time consuming (7) Projects are collage making from magazines that are old You cant have a cellphone in sight (NO EXCEPTIONS) or get kicked from 2 class periods. Lectures are extremely boring!(20 min notes and look at art pictures for 2 hours on the projector while he talks). He isn't interesting or funny either.
404,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART300,1.0,5.0,"worst professor at ARC ever, I am a straight-A student, and I can't keep up with his sh*t. even though we are under stress with the whole pandemic, he just doesn't make anything better. do not take him, you will regret this."
405,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART300,1.0,5.0,"Frustrating in person. COVID-19 adds insult to injury. I check my messages regularly and one email had missing instructions at the start of a gap for the next assignment. Even so, he says I'M mistaken even though it's the truth. Even if you email him the pictures requested, he may say they're missing or wrong, and you have to send them again."
406,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,1.0,5.0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! he is not a good professor.
407,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,1.0,5.0,"with this stress we are having because of the Coronavirus, he makes everything more stressful. each email he sends us we have to send him images, and not that only, if the images are wrong you have to email them again with new images, this should be done in 24 hours. we have a quiz each week, the midterm is 5 questions 20 points each. he is awful!"
408,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART327,1.0,4.0,"Get ready to figure out oil painting all by yourself, because he doesn't teach a single thing about it. Tons of sketchbook homework, and expects a ton of time and effort out of it, and MUST draw from 3 categories, all of which are expected to be in realism. With each subsequent painting I hated what I was making more and more."
409,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART320,1.0,5.0,"He is horrible. Hard to understand what he wants , doesnt explain well. He has a lot of stupid rules. Would not take again"
410,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART300,1.0,5.0,"Highly strict grader and exhaustive sketch requirements. We spend hours on them outside of class; he always says something is lacking. No constructive tip or at least a compliment. It doesn't seem like he understands that we learn differently. His directions are unclear or change unannounced. It is said to be a ""beginning"" class. In reality, NO!!!!"
411,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,1.0,3.0,Hes not a good professor at all. All he does is lecture for a third of the class and then talk about art the other two thirds. Be prepared to be put asleep by him. All he grades by is quizzes and tests and if you dont remember and memorize youll fail the class. He doesnt use canvas either so be prepared to be in the dark about your grade.
412,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART300,4.0,4.0,This class was such a letdown. This guy is so disconnected I can't believe he thought he could offer any insight as a teacher. He sits and reads about art instead positively interacting with students who are there to learn. Too bad.
413,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART300,2.0,4.0,"Big disappointment. Difficult assignments - portrait paintings, landscapes etc and never teaches on how to paint. Sits in his chair reading art books. At end of semester a hard quiz. Miss more than 2 questions, he takes 30 points off your final project. Does give good feedback. CRAZY sketch book expectation. The class spirit is somber. Do not take."
414,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART327,1.0,4.0,"Grades on skill. Extremely high standards. Very arrogant. Tells really annoying jokes all the time. Very nit-picky &amp; always says how ""bad"" students' art is. Crazy sketchbook requirements. No room for imagination, very specific criteria. Thinks phones are the devil, doesn't even allow listening to music while painting. Takes the fun out of painting."
415,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,INTROTOART30,3.0,3.0,"He was an okay teacher. I personally didn't have a problem with him, but it did seem as if he gave better grades to the students who didn't even try."
416,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,2.0,3.0,"Not a great teacher. He can be crabby and the way he teaches isn't enjoyable. Class is pretty dry and boring. Attendance is very strict and he hates cell phones, will kick you out of class for two periods if he sees one. Also doesn't post grades online. If you do have to take him, don't take him in the morning or you will fall alseep"
417,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ARTH300,3.0,3.0,"He's a good teacher, however it can be hard to score well on quizzes and tests because the art pieces are really subjective, so instead of a right or wrong answer, it's usually the MOST right answer, which and be tricky, especially for those students who take his class and aren't actually art majors."
418,226674,Craig,Smith,American River College,Art,ART329,1.0,5.0,"I took professor Smith's class and found it to be a huge letdown. I've taken several other painting and drawing classes in the past. But unfortunately I can't recommend. Mr. Smith. He seems to lack the ability to communicate clearly in regard to instruction. Conceptually he must have some grasp on the material, he simply fails at communicating."
420,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1402,5.0,4.0,"I am taking Dr James for the second time. I love when he helps for office hours and clarifies what is going on in the problem on homework and tests. He has a very good teaching style and I like his class to be synchronous because then I can get interaction with the instructor and ask questions. You have MasteringPhysics, Take home problems for hw."
421,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,4.0,Dr James is the best physics professor I ever had. I hated physics when I was in high school. He gave me a good liking for physics. If yall hate physics he will fix that completely. He does all things to help you get an A. He is very helpful with homework and even on exams. He has a great study hack (do hw without notes). He has good lectures.
422,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2426,5.0,4.0,"E&amp;M is a hard course. Your ability to apply calculus and modeling techniques to solve physics problems will be tested immensely. This class takes a lot of work to pass, let alone get an A. But Friedrichsen will give you all the information you need to do so. He will prepare you for the next step and challenge you to dig deep. He's a great teacher."
423,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,4.0,4.0,"I liked Dr. James' teaching style. He records his lectures and posts them online afterwards, so if you miss a class, you can easily catch up. My only issue with the class is that he would frequently arrive 10-15 minutes late, so we fell behind schedule and ended up not covering all of the material listed in the syllabus."
424,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,4.0,AMAZING! He is such a great teacher and he truly cares about his student's success. He is willing to get back to basics to help those in need and is very smart and just all around a great person! I have zero complaints. His class was the hardest class I had taken then but he is such a great professor that I have fond memories and had a great time!
425,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2426,3.0,5.0,I took PHYS2425 and 2426 with him. I have never really liked physics and it is really hard for me to grasp. His lectures are all projected on the board so if you sit in the back of the class you won't be able to see it. There is a lot of homework and I found the tests to be super hard. PHYS2426 is hard and takes a lot of time to pass.
426,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,4.0,The best physics professor in the state of Texas! take him whenever you can. Does a lot of examples in class and doesn't skip important details while lecturing!
427,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,3.0,you have to take him to understand why he is the best. The way he explain the material make it so easy to understand and in addition he upload the lecture videos so you can review the material. I will take him again next semester.
428,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,5.0,"He is an amazing professor overall. The labs are quite intense and require some work. However, the homework is a whole other beast. The homework is tedious and will take at times 6-8 hours. (Coming from a STEM major, that makes A's on math and science courses.) However, it is an amazing practice for the exam. Also gives out exam reviews."
429,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1402,5.0,2.0,"If you understand the material for physics 1, this will be a breeze. He is an amazing professor and throughly explains the material. Just take him."
430,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,3.0,"It's not that his class is hard but the material is hard itself and he's really good at explaining it so just take him. You need a box of colorful pens, don't ask why just have them ready for class, it helps a lot. He does require pearson but DO NOT BUY IT until you show up to class. He gives you a code for a discount and it's SO MUCH CHEAPER."
431,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PH1401,5.0,1.0,Take him for physics he is amazing at teaching and makes the subject really interesting to learn. He gives a review a week in prior before the exam and has it in order from each chapter which makes it really easy. But overall super amazing professor. This is also coming from someone who has never taken physics even in highschool.
432,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PH1401,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor. During the exams he gives you a lot of extra credit even if you didn't get the answer. His lectures are tied in with the lab which makes it super easy to grasp the material. He has online homework and you have unlimited tries to get a 100. The labs are really easy and he will help when ever you need it.
433,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1402,5.0,5.0,I love Dr. James! I took him for physics 1 &amp; 2 and made an A in both! He is very helpful if you have questions. His lectures are enjoyable. He posts video &amp; audio of all of his lectures online so you can watch them if you missed/are confused. STAY AHEAD so you don't fall behind. He gives a week to complete hw. DO IT EARLY. He is so smart and nice!
434,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PH1401,5.0,4.0,"I took Physics 1401 in the fall and i was super worried about doing well in this class. My only math experience was College Algebra, but Dr. J let me continue on in the class anyways. I had to teach myself trig ( Which honestly wasn't terrible) and i really put in a ton of time into this class. I ended up getting an A in the class! Take Dr. J!!!"
435,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1402,5.0,2.0,"HW. Easy 90+. Problems and online hw mimic  problems done during class.  Lab reports. Less than 5 formal reports. Easy 90+. Other lab reports  can be  turn them in with a group. Easy 90+ Exams inc. essay, short answer problems, and numerical problems.  Study chapters and use hw problems to practice. Easy 80+ on exams.  Professor is super helpful."
436,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2426,5.0,3.0,"Overall, the class is challenging and you must be motivated to learn. That being said Dr. J is a great professor that cares about his students. The homework can be tedious but do them and pay attention during lectures and you will know how to do every test question. Bonuses on every test to help boost your grade. Great professor!"
437,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2426,4.0,4.0,By far the best physics teacher at ACC. He is a very intelligent person who explains the material clear. He also has his lectures online in case you missed anything.
438,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2426,5.0,3.0,"He is an outstanding professor who knows how to teach and how to explain. If you have to take PHYS 2426, this is your best professor at ACC."
439,997455,James,Friedrichsen,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYSICS1402,5.0,2.0,Dr. J. is straigt up amazing. I don't have one bad thing to say about him or his class. You will learn so much. Pro Tip: Register early if you want a spot in his class for physics!
441,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,3.0,4.0,"Not online! I read the textbook cover to cover, looked up practice question answers, and went in-depth with every topic and googled them till I knew practically everything about it. All but one test I got a score I did not like so I would remember a few questions I got wrong on the test and try to find the answer in the book. Weren't there."
442,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,i emailed him multiple times asking questions throughout the semester and he got back to me very late and didnt give detailed responses in the emails so then i had to email again to clarify what he meant by the previous one sentence responses.
443,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,I took this guy for HIST1301 and HIST1302. He's a really talented lecturer and storyteller. What he does is he goes over the need-to-know for the test and then he'll tell some really cool obscure story you've never heard about that has to do with whatever time period/person he's talking about. He makes the class really interesting and Id recommend.
444,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,4.0,1.0,"I did minimal work in his online HIST 1302 class, and I still got an A. You have to take around five tests, and he gives you a study guide for each of them. Just Google the answers to the study guide questions, and you can pass the tests. Don't bother reading the textbook. To get an A, you also have to write a research paper, but it wasn't hard."
445,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,I took his 8 week course online. An 8week course is already a lot to cram. No communication what so ever. He made it clear that if you want an A you need to email him for feedback on test. I never got a response. I definitely would not recommend this professor. Im not sure if hes better in person. But do not take online.
446,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,"This class consisted reading, reading, and READING. It wasnt too bad. Just make sure you read, he has study guides on BB, I would advise to use them. Youll also have to contact him twice, also you will need the textbook"
447,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,His syllabus was confusing to understand and the study guide he put on blackboard would not work for a week or two. He doesn't answer emails quickly unless it's the two mandatory emails to get a C in the course. Highest grade is a C unless you write a book report for a B or for an A you have to make a 80 on each test and write a research paper.
448,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Not sure why there are bad reviews for this prof. Took him for both HIST 1&amp;2, super straightforward online class. Honestly barely used the book, mostly studied for tests from Quizlet and made an 87 average over the 5 tests. Writing the research paper for an A is hefty-- start early and you'll thank yourself. Don't take if you can't manage your time"
449,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,3.0,1.0,He is super nice and the class is very straight forward. Four tests and two exams but the tests are exactly word for word from the lectures. His classes are pretty boring but he makes sure to go over what you need to do well.
450,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,Dr. Purcell although clear on grading criteria does not give timely feedback to help you achieve a good grade. You will have to email and call him a few times before getting the information/clarification that you need. I would not recommend this class.
451,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301012,1.0,5.0,Worst Instructor you will ever deal with. He did not participate on blackboard and the test are crazy. He won't give you more than 70 in the second attempt.
452,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,I would not recommend this class to anyone. I am an all A student and ended with a B in this course. The level of effort and study time does not reflect the grades in this class. There are only 4 tests and your entire grade comes from that. Not interesting at all and extremely hard. No extra credit. Do not take.
453,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,1.0,3.0,After reading several good reviews online I decided to take Professor Purcells class. I chose to withdraw not even 3 weeks in due to the nature of his incredibly biased lectures. He seems to be telling the story of america from an extremely biased and slightly racist perspective. i dont pay to hear about someones opinion of history...0/5 stars
454,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"This was the easiest and best history class I have ever taken. Prof is nice, clear cut and doesn't try to trick you. Each lecture slide corresponds to a question on the review which corresponds to a question on the test. As long as you know the slides (they aren't hard or long) you will pass just fine. Go to class, he doesn't post the slides"
455,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,Good teacher :)
456,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"He gives you the option of using an online textbook or buying an older version that you can find in paperback (which is the choice I recommend if you like having something physical in front of you). You have to keep up with the reading, but if you take notes according to the study guide and then study them the tests are pretty straightforward."
457,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,3.0,1.0,"5 Test's worth 30 points each. To get an A you have to get an average of 24/30 on the tests and write the A level paper. So you can get a B on the tests, write the A level paper and get an A. Tests are super easy just do the reading, and the questions that go with it. This was the online class."
458,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,4.0,2.0,"I took the online 6-weeks summer class and overall I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is a looking to complete their U.S History credit. During the course you will have a test each week that will cover 4 chapters. The professor does provide an optional, but highly recommended reading guide that you can use to study."
459,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"Took the summer 6-week online class. Its difficult trying to make time EVERY DAY to set aside 2 hours to read through the book and answer the study guide, but thats what you have to do. Fast-paced, so keep up by setting goals: complete 10 questions/day, then study that. Tests are not clear-cut, but the research paper isnt bad if you start early."
460,209557,Allan,Purcell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,I took the online history 1301 in the spring. Try to get a 100 on the maps test because it will help you if you dont do well on the future tests. I would say avoid wasting time on the questions in blackboard and just do the practice tests and take notes and study off of those.
462,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,BCIS1305,5.0,3.0,Knows his computer applications. Good lessons and lecture pacing. Get group 3.
463,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,"Professor Cheatheam is a real gem, he will help you when you need it and genuinely wants people to understand the lessons in class."
464,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,BCIS1305,5.0,3.0,"Lectures over text book material, than a lab in class over Microsoft Office. Hardest thing is the online Pearson MyLabIT garbage that is unfair and unforgiving. 4 group projects that require a presentation to the class over a specific scenario, so don't be shy and lazy. 3 tests, multiple choice, then Pearson online garbage. Awesome professor!"
465,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,Overall a great teacher. Will help anyone who needs help and will make sure that everyone understands what is going on.
466,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,CMPTR1301,5.0,2.0,Super easy and fun class. Learned a lot of little secrets about Microsoft's programs that I didn't know before. Great professor and would defently take his class again
467,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COM1301,5.0,1.0,He is a great teacher. I was able to finish all my assignment in class. He gives review question and open book test.
468,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,CMPTR1301,4.0,4.0,"Great Teacher , learned alot.."
469,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,BCIS1305,5.0,2.0,The class was easy thanks to the professor very kind and hillarious if you take this professor the lectures he makes are very entertaining
470,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC1301,4.0,4.0,There is a lot of work.  It's not hard but it fallows the program in book and online.  Stay on top of work and your golden.  Professor has been in the field for a long time so he has a lot of relatable material for the class.
471,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC13607,5.0,2.0,He's great!
472,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,Cheatheam was a outstand prof! always has something cool to talk about and has been wonderful to attend his classes
473,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COMP1301,5.0,1.0,Mr. Cheatheam is a good teacher. Grading is flexible but the software used for the class could be better. Easy A if you show up and try but if you just show up you are likely to still make a B. Do all the assignments and you will pass.
474,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,"Very good Instructor and very helpful. Show up, listen and learn and you will pass. Laid back style of teaching, but pay attention."
475,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC1301,3.0,1.0,"Mr. Cheatheam is a very nice teacher. However, lectures can be long and grading can be confusing at times. Coursework is simple. Open-book tests."
476,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,CMPTR1301,5.0,1.0,The teacher was very helpful and understanding of any issues.  He made a point to show examples and apply knowledge we learned.
477,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,CMPTR1301,4.5,1.0,Easy A if you pay attention in class and do your homework
478,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,CMPTR1301,5.0,1.0,Very good instructor very help clear and does everything to make he's students succed in the future very great guy would love to take him again in the future...
479,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,INTROCOMP,4.5,2.0,"Easy A if you're willing to listen. Always ready to help, even after class. The material follows the syllabus to a T."
480,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,"Show up to class, do the assignments, get an A.  I am in the computer industry and worried this would waste my time.  However, I picked up several tips using Microsoft Office that will help in my professional work."
481,718124,L.D.,Cheatheam,Austin Community College,Computer Science,COS126,5.0,1.0,very helpful. A every discussion in class is meant to educate- and is very good.
483,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,"Professor Decker is a great teacher! Clear grading criteria, lots of opportunities to improve, and a caring teacher. Loved this class! :)"
484,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,1.0,"Professor Decker made the short, 5-week class during a pandemic, seamless. Super easy class, especially if you already have basic knowledge about good 'ole Texas government."
485,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed taking her class. The lectures are entertaining and very easy to follow along with. The beginning of class would always start off with a funny youtube song related to the lecture of the day so it would make the class easier to understand. J Decker is very cool and even when the class turned online, she was just as accessible!"
486,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,3.0,"I'm a dual credit student, and Professor Decker has been my favorite teacher so far! I took her Texas Government class online, I thought that online would be difficult at first but her teaching style and activities made it really easy to learn. One piece of advice I would give is to really study for the tests to make sure you know the material."
487,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,3.0,"Prof Decker is AMAZING! The Homework is straight from the Lecture slides, Activity Responses are short clips (just write a response to what you watched) and 4 Exams. I wrote Essays instead of doing exams because memorizing info from lectures was hard for me. Super helpful, replies same day to questions, wants you to pass!!"
488,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Julz is amazing! His class is simple: take notes, read slides, do the homework/ activity responses, and show up! Attendance isnt mandatory, but he will give points at the end. It might seem like a lot, but it isnt. class is open to explaining more in depth so ask questions! Would high recommend."
489,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,2305GOV,5.0,3.0,"Shes genuinely enthusiastic about her subject. Theres 5 tests, 4 easy homework assignments. In her tests she asks questions about videos and songs she plays in class and attendance is part of the grade so you have to show up. Her lectures are comprehensive and fun. Show up and pay attention and youve got an A."
490,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,I loved this class. The tests are pretty similar to the test review. Free online textbook. Daily extra credit opportunities. Gives a lot of visuals.
491,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,"Decker is an amazing professor. I have never had an interest in Government, but she made it fun and interesting to learn. I enjoy coming to class and getting to learn what she has to say for the day. She gives you a review in blackboard for every test, and will tell you what will specifically be on the exam. One homework assignment for each test"
492,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,Im so happy I was able to take Professor Decker. She is so nice and gives you easy homework as well as extra credit. This motivated me to continue learning more from her. She provides excellent feedback and available for help when needed.
493,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,"Professor Decker is an amazing professor, the best I've had so far. The homework and short answer activities are there solely to help you study. She really makes the material easy to understand and interesting to someone who previously hated politics and wanted nothing to do with it. There's always extra credit options available too."
494,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,2305GOV,5.0,2.0,"Professor Decker is amazing! So so helpful!! The homework is easy, the activity responses have no right or wrong answers BUT she is looking for effort and proof in your response that you at least reviewed information. Exams were a little tough for me on memorization. She does offer alternative essays to replace exam. Very helpful!! Easy A"
495,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,2.0,"Professor Decker goes beyond the average Texas government class curriculum and adds engaging current event articles, podcasts, and documentaries that encourage participation in the political process. It is clear which way she sways on the political scale but she never condemned others view points and appreciates an impassioned response to xtra cred"
496,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,This was my second class with professor Decker. I took her online class but wish I took her in class b/c her lectures were so helpful. She gives great test reviews but if you do the big pictures and the terms you will be alright. Only 4 hw's and there's always a chance to get extra credit.
497,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,4.0,2.0,Professor Decker is cool. Responds really fast to emails and grades fair. Complete the assignments and youll pass. Reviews are very similar to the tests as well.
498,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT1301,5.0,1.0,Took the online class and would take again. Study the big picture and terms lists she gives and you'll make an A. She gives 5pts Extra Credit for each test. You have 3 1 paragraph response activities per section. You also have 1 homework per section. She offers an optional 5th test and optional HW. Do the work and study a little and you get an A.
499,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,"I wish she did more online classes. The lectures were straight forward. As long as you go through everything, you'll get an A on the exams. Make sure you read through links she provides, some Q's on the exams are based on those!!! She provides videos and articles concerning each topic, so it was easy to connect and understand. I've learned so much."
500,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,Best professor I have ever had. Amazing and interesting lectures. I actually changed my major to government because I enjoyed the class so much.
501,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,Decker is AMAZING!!!! She will work with you if you work with her. The tests are not that hard if if you study the review provided by her. Textbook is not needed and lots of extra credit opportunities. It's good to attend the class because it helps so much. I had her for Local Gov't and US Gov't and I loved it. I would recommend her.
502,1188084,Julia,Decker,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"GOVT2305/Decker Insightful curriculum, engaging lectures. Provides pertinent info (doesn't focus on dates/bland memorization, but on events/significance). So many great outside resources were recommended and interesting issues were talked about during this course. Attendance is ""required"" in the sense of lectures being useful/interesting."
504,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this professor. He wants you to read two novels for an A in an 8 week course. Not only that but the papers have to be 7 pages long each, with 6 quotes from the novels in each paragraph. Also you have to compare the novels to scripture found in the textbook. Grading rubric is absurd. A in this class  difficult"
505,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"Because I took this class, I have an advantage in all other courses which require writing, critical thinking and analyzing difficult texts. This is the best professor i've ever had. he goes above and beyond . You will not regret taking his course."
506,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,3.0,3.0,I didn't have any problems with professor Lauderback. Just email him and explain your situation with him and he's pretty understanding.
507,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,2.0,3.0,"I took his honors history class ""terrorism in America and around the world"". he was a great guy, really nice but his lectures were absolutely awful. he tries to be funny and goes on tangents which relates nothing to the material. Sometimes we went a whole day without discussing the readings. I respect him and he's nice but not a great professor."
508,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,I took Dr. Lauderback's 8 week course. There is alot of reading and many back to back deadlines. The first exam is a map exam. The following exams are harder and require much more preparation! I found it hard to study for the exams beacuse there was just SO much info! But Dr. Lauderback cares about his students success. Will most likely take again
509,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,I took Professor Lauderback's online course and he was awesome. Very detailed and thorough when giving feedback about an exam or project. Very passionate and concerned with your outcome in the class. Gives lots of opportunities to make an A and is very clear on expectations to do so.
510,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"There is constant encouragement and help from this professor. If he sees you are working hard, you will get good grade. He is not about his teaching, but about us learning. He is very fair and if you read all material, you will easily pass the class. There is average amount of work. Very caring and understanding. Taking again in future."
511,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,"Unrealistic expectations for a 100 level class. I had to take a history class before I could start my masters program. In order to obtain an A in this class you have to complete 2, 7 page book reviews, on top of 4 quizzes weekly, and an exam. If you do not score over an 80% on all graded material, you will receive a C in the class."
512,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,"Don't take his class if you're not a history buff or have other classes. There are a lot of chapters to read so you'll easily fall behind. Also, two book reviews are required for an A. I took the online 8-week course and regret it because I had to end up dropping the class because it was just a ridiculous amount of work. Save yourself the stress."
513,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,For an A and B grade you are required to write an analysis on a history topic. I skipped this part because I was already taking the 8 week course and it felt. I feel like I had a good understanding of the material but barely passed. Some of the questions seemed tricky. His documents are on his website. Too much info should have been easier to find.
514,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,5.0,"If you would like to enroll with Professor Lauderback in HIST 1301 as an online course, be prepared to automatically have 10+ assignments lined up due within the week. Due to having other classes and work, I dropped the class, because the course was too overwhelming, and I could not pace myself with the course. I recommend taking it alone."
515,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"Structured and engaging. Not always in a good way. I completed Dr. Lauderback's eight week course, and it was challenging. He offers many study materials, which actually made it more difficult to understand his expectations and grading criteria. If you're struggling, you must communicate with him. Passing his class was rewarding and enriching."
516,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"Extremely test(5)/quiz(15) heavy &amp; count twice. Highly recommend using the study guides for quizzes/tests. TIP I reviewed my quizzes and wrote the info on my study guides for my tests. 2 book reviews required for an A, kind of ridiculous, but I got A's on both so it's possible. Took 2 DAYS TO RESPOND TO EMAILS so don't expect a quick response."
517,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"DML is incredible! take his honors section, which has a focus on terrorism in america and around the world. be warned: it's a lot of work, but so worth it. in addition to history, DML will teach you how to become a more rounded writer and person. yes, his expectations/rubric can be daunting but his feedback is detailed and he wants student success!"
518,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,We had to do 2 ridiculous book reviews. This guy grades like an a pig. He grades in a terrible way. Very complicated
519,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"Save yourself time, and never ever think of taking this guy for online courses. Terrible! The weirdest grading rubric ever. terrible do not take him."
520,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"I never rate my professors but this one really needed another good rating. You have to put in work to study and participate in class but he is very organized, sarcastically funny, and really cares for his students and their work. One of his mottos is ""come see me, come talk to me"" so he makes himself available if you are struggling!"
521,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,This class requires a lot studying if you plan to pass! Professor Lauderback is very understanding of work and family life and is very willing to help you figure out a way to at least earn a C in the class if you are willing to work for it.
522,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,3.0,"The class is fine if you're just aiming to get a C to transfer the credit. However, if you care about getting a A or your GPA, I don't recommend the class. To get an A, you have to do 2 book reviews and get at least a 90 on EVERY test and quiz. Prof also seemed lazy and disorganized because everything on Blackboard redirected you to his website."
523,677799,David,Lauderback,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,"The tests and quizzes aren't bad, most of the answers are online. However, the grading requirements are ridiculous. The final grade isn't based on your average but what you complete in the class. Also no +/- scale. The grading criteria for the essays are confusing and overly demanding and he's not a coherent communicator over email. Don't recommend"
525,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,"PLEASE I am BEGGING you, do not take this class. This was one of my first college classes coming straight from high school. Online he is not available whatsoever and then judges you when you do need help. I took this class during COVID and we had no guidance at all. Tests and quizzes were NOTHING like the real tests!!"
526,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,5.0,1.0,Awesome Professor! If I had to take him again I wouldnt have any doubts Im my mind not to. I signed a C Contract and endured up with a B. Hands down best professor Ive ever had. Online class super easy.
527,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,4.0,3.0,"This class is simple if you do a few things. Attend Class for lecture notes, Read the book chapters and do the chapter objectives outside of class. Professor Bell gives extra credit in group assignments such as cross words and multiple choice questions. To get an A all you have to do is attend class, read and study. Simple as that. No excuses."
528,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,5.0,"Although the tests are multiple choice, you better make sure you know every detail of the question, or else you'll be having to play your hand. The most annoying questions were ones that asks ""what is NOT a detail of ____"" or ask for minor details of events or of characteristics of a person. Responds at any time. Be careful to read the syllabus."
529,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,3.0,"I'm taking his online class. He puts absolutely no effort into the class. He only reminds you of due dates when you are half way into the semester. He asks you to read the chapters, comment, then test- not too complicated but I almost forgot that I had the class because he is so uninvolved. Would highly NOT recommend his online class."
530,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,1.0,4.0,I dont know how to further explain.
531,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,1.0,4.0,"He's not very hands on and even though I read every chapter and gave in depth answers on my reviews the tests are filled with ridiculous ""gotcha"" answers. Every couple of questions will have 2 or 3 answers that basically worded the same but slightly different so it really impedes your chances to succeed and forces you into unnecessary extra work."
532,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,1.0,5.0,The online course is very difficult due to the test
533,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,5.0,3.0,"Prof Bell is amazing. Prepare to have your worldview blown out of your skull. Work hard, participate in class and DO THE HOMEWORK. All tests are directly from reading/ homework w/ extra credit from lectures. If you follow his instructions he hands you an A, practically guaranteed. Hard but worth the effort. Made history REAL."
534,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,3.0,4.0,"Mr. Bell is a really good teacher, when I say that I mean he knows his stuff &amp; you learn a lot in his class. This class is not a cake walk and get ready to be challenged. He is very direct. What he says in the beginning of the class (first day) is absolutely true. Study the slides, book, do the review, read every chapter, and study, you will pass."
535,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,1.0,I will not take a course from a Professor who does not give a chance for students to pass. Harris withdrawal me from his course when I made at least a grade C out of his three test that was due in a few weeks and after I had 6 comments on the discussing board. So why pay a professor when you can learn history on your own?
536,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,1.0,4.0,"The class is easy enough, in theory. Mr. Bell, unfortunately, does not do anything to teach the class and then is incredibly condescending and rude when asked any questions. I was registered for his 1302 class but have since dropped it due to his poor attitude. I do not recommend this professor."
537,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,1.0,4.0,"Looking to study African American history? You're better off reading the text book. The test questions are oddly specific, despite having broad review concepts. The teacher leaves hardly any input into the class and it isn't made clear how exactly the extra credit would add in if the class is based on a contract. Just read the text book."
538,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,ENGL1301,5.0,4.0,"Very entertaining class. All the grades are tests and one very, very easy project. Theres three things that help you on the tests: Slides, book, and review. I dont recommend reading the book, just do the review, and show up to class. He gives a lot of opportunities for extra credit If you want to ace the class you have to do it. Easy points."
539,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,2.0,4.0,"Weirdest class I've taken, by far. You have to pick a ""grading contract"" which makes absolutely no sense. Read the contracts extremely carefully and don't automatically pick the A contract, unless you have a lot of time on your hands. Isn't responsive and tests are pretty difficult. Would not take him again, for sure."
540,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,5.0,4.0,"Awesome Professor with a great sense of humor. He is extremely caring and want his students to achieve their goal. Prepare yourself for a lot of reading the chapters are extremely long his teaching style is straight forward. This was a tough class, but I enjoyed the journey of History I hope to take more of Professor Bell classes.  Would definitely"
541,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,2.0,4.0,"If you take this class online though there are only 5 test you are really crunched for time on them. He makes you pick what grade you would like at the beginning of the course, if you pick the A contract must complete all of the requirement of the other contracts as well as write a lengthy paper. My advice is read all of the contracts verycarefully"
542,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Bell will not babysit you, you are in college now. He is very clear on what you need to do to pass, just do it, and you will be fine. Read the syallbus. Learn how to read and retain information from a textbook. Review your notes, attend class, do the assignments, and you will pass with a good grade."
543,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,5.0,4.0,"This was one of my favorite classes this semester. History can be slow and boring, but professor Bell makes it fun and active. He always makes students laugh too!"
544,57860,Harris,Bell,Austin Community College,History,HIS1301,5.0,3.0,"The work you put in is what'll determine your grade. Interesting lectures, test questions are very specific so make sure you study notes &amp; read text book a lot. Has a sense of humor. Don't try to be on your phone &amp; think he won't see you. He was defiantly worth taking!"
546,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,"Was a wonderful professor. I messed up and got a C on my first essay and reached out for help. The professor gave me great feedback on how to improve my paper and tips on composition. After that first C, the rest of my essays were scored as As due to his advice. Grading criteria is also very clear."
547,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Moore has been great. I took him for 1301 and am taking him for 1302. He is a fair grader and gives clear criteria. You can submit drafts to him ahead of time and he will give you feedback that will get you an A if applied. He moves due dates back and has make ups available. Great class but you have to love reading, digesting &amp; writing."
548,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,COMP1,5.0,2.0,"Super sweet guy, very understanding and genuine. Great professor overall."
549,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,I enjoyed taking his class and was intrigued by the short stories he picked to discuss in class. Gives great feedback on your essays and even provides additional help (purdue owl links) for a better understanding of any mistakes you make in your writing.
550,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"I really liked Professor Moore, he gave great feedback and genuinely wanted you to do well and improve. I didn't find him to be a tough grader, I thought he was fair and consistent. He doesn't waste his student's time. He gives big windows to complete the essays and doesn't ask for too much. Great professor!"
551,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,COMP1,4.0,4.0,"Professor Moore is a pretty tough grader. He just wants you to try your best and to be better than when you started. He is very accessible outside of class. He goes over the material and tries his best to makes sure everyone understands the criteria. He allows you to make up low grades, gives good feedback and helpful notes."
552,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,4.0,2.0,Professor Moore was great. Easy grader and very accessible. The only aspect of his class that I would have preferred was a bit more constructive feedback.
553,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,COMP1,1.0,5.0,"If you want to learn how to be a better writer better drop now. He provides two syllabuses which he decides,in his mind, he would like to use that day. I go to the learning lab and the two other professors said if they did what he did they would be jobless, thanks acc for allowing the old dudes to do whatever they want. Dropping class now!"
554,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"I wouldn't retake him, plain and simple. Super tough grader"
555,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,4.0,3.0,"I took him for this class in Fall 2017. I loved his sense of humor, although sometimes his lectures could drag on a bit. Make sure to do the readings as he does have pop quizzes. Overall, he is a pretty good professor and I recommend taking Comp 2 with him."
556,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,3.0,3.0,"He wasn't an easy grader at first but if you follow the guidelines and listen to what he doesn't like, you'll get an A. He is just very picky and subjective. Very lecture heavy with a lot of rambling. Most of the times he let us leave early because there was nothing to do... sometimes going to class was a waste of time. He gave helpful feedback."
557,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,1.0,4.0,"Lecture heavy? You might call it that, if you want to learn anything about English dont take him! He should be teaching a politics class. You learn nothing to improve your technique in writing he just wants you to already know everything. He has a way of making everyone feel like they are less of a person, so beware of talking in lecture."
558,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,3.0,4.0,"This class was boring but professor Moore kept it interesting. I withdrew because I couldn't wake up for this class and actually stay awake. He kept the lectures bearable by relating them to current events. If English bores you, don't take this class before 10am. He's the toughest grader I've had by far. This is book and lecture heavy so BEWARE."
559,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,3.0,3.0,"Professor Moore is a kind man who has two sides, a good one and a bad one. If you do what is being asked of you and do it diligently, while PARTICIPATING IN CLASS DISCUSSIONS, he will take note of it. He assigns a lot of readings which is routine for a Literature class and tests that ask you to summarize it. Essays leave room for creativity."
560,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,3.0,2.0,"Only took his online class; in emails and handouts, he does sometimes come off as rude. He is very quick to respond to emails, and what you have to do in the class is very straightforward- 4 essays and an exam. But important information sent out is occasionally here, there, and everywhere. But overall, none of this would deter me from taking again."
561,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,2.0,1.0,"Stay away from this Professor as he is the head of the English department, does not clearly define what he requires of students, goes on random tangents about his southern family, is inconsistent in grading (corroborated through other students), and is angered when students corroborating their work with UT English faculty. The material is standard"
562,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,3.0,4.0,"Lots of reading with shorts stories and will give pop Quizzes, so always read the stories. Hard grader on papers so I suggest going to the campus learning lab that your class is at, very nit picky. Participation is encouraged or he will call you out anyway and ask plenty of questions. Something what he goes over in class doesn't match the essays."
563,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,4.0,2.0,"I took my comp 1 class online and did a total of 4 papers and a final at campus. he gives you a second chance to redo 2 papers in order to get a better grade. i have always been good at writing papers and since that is all this class consisted of, it was an easy A."
564,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,4.0,4.0,Professor Moore really doesnt teach you that much new material. Theres five papers you have to to write over the course. These determine your grade so you have to work hard on them. Hes a very picky grader so proof reading will be your best friend. Hes super helpful so if you have questions he is more than willing to help. Also dont be tardy!!
565,83416,Lee,Moore,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,4.0,1.0,Prof. Moore explains what is expected and sticks to his guns. My first four papers were the easiest papers I have written in years. I can't stand writing papers. I made an A on all of them and then didn't write another paper the rest of the semester and received a C. I'll take it!
567,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,2.0,3.0,"During many of the lectures you will take it will become apparent that slightly off-topic rants, typically about war, are very common. Do not expect specific grading criteria or feedback on papers, such as my last paper for a ""reflective essay"" which had one and only line ""Please withdraw if you don't want to receive an F."" with no further support."
568,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,3.0,"Professor Hoppe was an great teacher! he is very passionate about his classes, and expects participation from EVERYONE! dont let that scare you he creates a wonderful open discussion for every story. quizzes are daily but very easy, a good way to get grade up so SHOW UP! I loved his class so much! very understanding, interesting sense of humor!"
569,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hoppe is absolutely phenomenal. I personally don't care for English as a subject and have always viewed it as an obstacle, but his approach to teaching &amp; his lectures made comp 2 enjoyable &amp; I looked forward to his lectures. Participation is extremely important and expect to write lots of papers, but he is accessible and very helpful."
570,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,Words can't describe how terrible of a prof he is. 3-4 students remained out of 28 bc it is easy to fail if you don't write what HE wants. He is extremely rude and set on his opinions but hides it under a persona of a cool/funny guy. He's not. You will learn by the end of the semester he is only there to fulfill a deep inferiority complex he has.
571,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,I have never had a worse professor. All the bad reviews explain him perfectly. My GPA suffered because he simply disagreed with my opinion. Don't think you can succeed in his class because you hold yourself in high regard. I always excelled in English and he basically failed me for me doing my final essay over a subject he disagreed with. Awful.
572,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,Hoppe does not care about you or your progress. He's more interested in showing off his knowledge. Only 4-5 students of 28 remain by semester's end; this seems to be his M.O. Being a gatekeeper of quality is noble until it becomes elitist. He has forgotten that teaching is also a paid service. Don't waste your money. Find someone who will teach.
573,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,"Prof Hoppe definitely prepared me to be a stronger analytical writer. I came to class expecting to glide through another English class with ease, but after getting my first paper back I realized I actually had to try. If you want to become a better writer I highly recommend this class. Discussion time was 10/10 and he always kept us entertained."
574,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"If you skated through high school and expect the same in college, beware. You actually have to pay attention, do the reading, and follow instructions in this class. If you are able to do those things, you'll be fine and you'll actually learn! MAGICAL! Joe Hoppe is hardworking and caring. He'll help you be a better writer, and be more successful."
575,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Hoppe has enjoyable classes until you go home and realize he just talked about background for the majority of the class and gave only 5 minutes of instruction on the actual assignments. His grading system is very strange, and it ends up with your entire grade resting on one paper- that is if you are one of the few who hasn't dropped out yet!"
576,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG2328,1.0,5.0,"This teacher doesn't give feedback on papers during the process of writing them, and appears to grade worse if your opinion differs from his. We even skipped an assignment in this class... syllabus not followed, and got WAY behind schedule. If you say the class is out of six papers, make it out of six and not five."
577,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,"Dont listen to the good reviews &amp; dont take him. All the bad reviews describe him perfectly. He lacks empathy in student work life. Even if you somehow keep up his strict essay grading and due dates, he rambles on for dear life. I cant remember a class where he didnt waste time on tangents. Not worth the stress, tears, or money."
578,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this teacher. Even if he is the only option available, don't take him. He is an unfair grader, he will only accept one paper at a time and it will make you get behind! I started with 28 people in my class and by Spring Break only had 9. He gives the ultimatum: ""withdrawal or fail my class"". IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!"
579,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,Hoppe is the best prof Ive had - including at UT. He knows his subject and then some! Hes passionate about writing and he does a lot to help his students learn and improve. Im a much better writer because of him.
580,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,"Im not a fan of writing essays but Im good at them, I have a 3.6 GPA. I took Hoppe and he requires 7 essays &amp; 1 department exam, he wont accept essay #2 if essay #1 isint accepted, he only accepts 1 essay per class. If he doesnt accept your essay 2x already, you're going to get behind and he has deadlines, &amp; you can either drop the class or get anF"
581,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,4.0,4.0,"If you really want to learn take this course. Professor Hoppe will help you get ready for your future. He is strict but you just need to follow his instructions and youll be fine. I struggled taking this course, but I really worked hard and did what I needed to do to get an A. Dont worry if your first papers dont get accepted, go get help."
582,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,4.0,"Hoppe really cares about your success! It wasn't easy for sure, but his lectures are your savior! He helps you with the outline of your paper, and ideas about what to include in you paper, so you're not going into your paper completely alone. If it wasn't for him helping us getting started on the format of out paper, I would have not done so well"
583,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2332,1.0,3.0,"This is by far the worst prof I have ever had. The workload was not that bad but he insults and criticizes your opinions and thoughts about the books, if they don't coincide with his. He claims he wants to hear you speak but he will attack your intelligence and competence. Rudest prof, save yourself and don't take his class."
584,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,1.0,3.0,"Do not take this class. No matter how well you think you've done, expect that Joe Hoppe will make you rewrite your essays. His grading methods make it impossible to pass if you dont turn in all weekly essays by end of the course. He only lets you turn in one essay per class, so if you get more than 2 rewrites on a paper you might as well withdraw."
585,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"I took this guy and he had a rule to where if one essay didn't make it through the stages of revised, edited, etc. then you weren't allowed to complete the next essay. He kept criticizing my first paper to where I had to drop or fail the class because I was too far behind. I transferred from this community college to a UNIVERSITY and aced it lol!"
586,672771,Joe,Hoppe,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this professor. He sets students up for failure by ""teaching"" how to write analytical essays all semester long, and then throws a comprehensive research essay as the final and determining factor for the final grade. He didn't teach anything about research essays all semester. Rude, unapproachable, unhelpful, and hostile. WORST EVER."
588,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2404,3.0,4.0,"She is a little difficult, but she does push you to think outside of the typical lecture questions. Just do the material ahead of time and follow the calendar she provides. Yeah she will email you at midnight for things that we will need the next day, but its also in the calendar! Studying is a must and yeah you have to know your stuff!"
589,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2401,2.0,5.0,"Took this as an 8 week course and would not recommend it if any of these are true: you work full time, you have children you need to parent, or you're taking other classes. This will be your full time job. I studied 5 + hours daily plus her class 3 hours in the evenings. Very difficult; I taught myself most things. Prof cares/is available to help."
590,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,3.0,2.0,"I have mixed feelings about this professor. She asked us questions during class and would go after us if we could not answer her questions. However, she offered opportunities for extra credit. To do well on this course, make sure to study days before the exam because there is alot of information to memorize."
591,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,4.0,"Take her as a last resort. Rude, unprofessional, unorganized, slow grader. If you read the text for 5 hrs/day you'll get an A. Her lectures are confusing and she takes personal offense if you don't already know A&amp;P like the back of your hand. Yells at students who answer her Qs wrong. Then got angry at us for not answering her Qs. Cant win. AVOID."
592,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,4.0,Took this during COVID. Chandler was very unorganized. She'd send emails at 12AM about what to review for the next class when our class was next morning at 8. She never had anything graded on time. Didn't find out what I made on exam 3 til class was over. Always talked to my classmates like were children/ idiots. Save yourself a headache and AVOID.
593,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,5.0,"AVOID. Wants you to learn and she knows her stuff but the insane amount of material presented is not possible in summer class. No test or class curves/exceptions/tiny bit of extra credit. Very confusing, unorganized online set up. Def take someone else if possible."
594,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,4.0,"Quite possibly the worst professor I've ever had. She is unclear about instructions/expectations for the class, is incredibly rude to students for either not knowing the answer or answering something wrong, and is wildly unorganized (lectures are all over the place, and it takes 3+ weeks for her to grade exams). Avoid her at all costs!"
595,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2304,2.0,5.0,"Dont do it. She cares whether you learn the material, but she doesnt actually teach it. If you have questions in class, she yells at you and judges you for not knowing everything immediately. Youre expected to know it from the insane (literally unachievable) amount of homework, notes, modules, review quizzes, and tests (graded 3+ weeks later)"
596,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,4.0,"She knows her stuff and can answer any question, if you haven't asked it before. Class was online bc COVID. She is behind on technology, but tried to keep up. Test online are MUCH easier than her test in class. She is very rude and will not repeat what she has gone over."
597,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2402,4.0,5.0,"I really enjoy taking her class, its completely straight forward. However if you are really sensitive beware! She will call you out and hold you responsible for being wrong in front of the whole class. I call that pure motivation while others may get their feelings hurt. If you thoroughly complete all assignments you will learn a lot! :) !"
598,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,3.0,"Finished with a 101% and I will never take a class with her again. Childish, rude, hypocritical, impatient, tardy. Treats students poorly, fills class-time with fruitless activities/handouts, is unintelligible in lecture. Exam questions are vague, some require an artist to complete. Set aside 10-12 hrs./week for a study group and you will succeed."
599,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,4.0,"I took both A&amp;P I and II with Dr Chandler and have the greatest respect for her as a professor. You'll need to put in long hours to complete all assignments/case studies/virtual labs and study for quizzes/exams, but she offers extra credit and is very helpful in her open lab. I earned better than 100% in both classes, and learned a LOT. Love her!"
600,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2401,2.0,3.0,She yelled at us in every class. She would yell at us for not answering her questions but it was because we were all too scared to answer her questions or else she would yell at us. This class isn't TOO bad except for being yelled at. It's a flipped classroom so there is TONS of outside work. (27 page guided notes 2x/week)
601,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,"Took over 8 wks. For me, it was at least 4-6 hrs a day of prep for lecture/lab (homework, guided notes, etc). Dr. Chandler's knowledge of this material is impressive, but she expects you to be prepared. Required work seemed overwhelming, but it allowed me to tell a story about the A&amp;P (especially physiology) rather than memorizing it."
602,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Chandler's Anatomy &amp; Physiology I course during the 8-week summer session. Be prepared; it involves a LOT of work outside the classroom. That said, Dr. Chandler is very fair and recognizes hard work; with all of the extra credit points, my final grade was over 100. I enjoyed her class and I'm taking her again for A&amp;P II in the fall."
603,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,AANDP2404,5.0,4.0,I took Dr. Chandler for A&amp;P 1 in the spring and A&amp;P 2 during her 8 week summer course. I strongly recommend taking her for both parts of the course like I did. I learned a lot and I made grades Im happy with. I respect/admire this woman for so many reasons. Im really going to miss her. Thank you Dr. Chandler &lt;3
604,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,4.0,Take her A&amp;P II in this summer for 8 weeks. She's not good at explaining the concept but she's caring about her students. She provides all the materials for you to get a good grade but you have to work for it. Her tests are fair to those who take time to study. She offers a bunch of extra credit so you definitely can make more than the total one.
605,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2404,3.0,5.0,"Dr. C is not always great at explaining concepts. Often handouts given for lab didn't match up with the supplies actually available. Study guides take forever to complete and she doesn't like if you complete them with a word processor rather than pen/pencil. Many ""critical thinking"" assignments where the answers aren't just ""in-book"" knowledge."
606,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,4.0,5.0,"She's not that bad! This is a flipped class so you have to do the notes before coming to class. This class is all about self-study. No test review but I feel her tests are not hard when compared to the concept. Extra credits a lot, I actually made more than the total points! Must have textbook to easily understand. 4* because of boring lecture."
607,993789,Aglaia,Chandler,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,Dr. Chandler is by far the best professor I have ever had. I thoroughly enjoyed her lectures and labs. There are no reviews for tests but this forces you to learn all of the material. I am taking her for A&amp;P II this summer because I know she is the best. I did very well in her class but more importantly I retained the material. Great experience!!
609,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENG2328,3.0,2.0,"This class wasn't too bad, but Dr. Thomas always seemed a bit frustrated. She twice incorrectly accused me of not watching lectures. On some discussion boards, I got points taken off for following her lecture. On some, I got points taken off for deviating from her lecture. Very difficult to please, unclear/changing guidelines."
610,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"Professor Thomas wants you to do well, and will go above and beyond to help you understand what you need to learn if you simply reach out to her. She is very responsive via email."
611,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,"""Gives Good Feedback"", ""Respected"", ""Hilarious"", are all also tags I would pick. Dr. Thomas is the rare combo of being a published, serious academic in her field + a fantastic teacher. She picks her material so well, teaches what the course requires, then takes it Next Level. She could be the star prof at an elite Liberal Arts college: lucky ACC!"
612,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2333,5.0,4.0,"To quote an English Comp II professor that I spoke to regarding Dr. Thomas: ""I think she's probably the best teacher at this school."" ACC is privileged to have someone of her caliber. When COVID-19 moved classes online halfway through the semester, she did a far better job preparing a curriculum than my other teachers had. Very grateful for her."
613,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Thomas was the best professor I've had at ACC! She's easy to talk to and very welcoming. Insightful, interesting, entertaining lectures. Her guidelines and expectations for assignments are clear which makes things a lot easier. Not only will you get an A, you will actually learn something from the assignments and the class in general. 100/100"
614,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENG2328,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely love Dr. Thomas! Her method of teaching is engaging and interesting. You will work, but you WILL learn! She is kind, but tough. If I wasn't already a Psych major I would be an English major after taking her class. I wish all professors were as wonderful as her. She is brilliant, funny, and a truly amazing human being."
615,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,Dr. Thomas is a GREAT professor. She gives great feedback on essays and allows revisions. She is super accessible outside of class and you can tell she really cares about her students. She is super funny and our assignments were very applicable to our lives. I would recommend everyone to take her!
616,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,1.0,3.0,"I signed up for her online summer class knowing it would be hard. But she was not fun at all, and she is an extremely difficult grader. I did not like her class nor her. She was way too harsh. I typically take my english classes in the summer but she was on a different level of harsh. DO NOT TAKE HER. THERE ARE BETTER PROFESSORS OUT THERE! z"
617,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,LIT2327,5.0,3.0,"I am so happy I took her class. I read some of the reviews before I signed up and I was nervous it would be difficult but she couldn't be more fun or nice. She's hilarious and she engages you in the discussion &amp; makes it fun. If you do the assignments and show up to class, it couldn't be easier."
618,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENG2328,5.0,3.0,"I am absolutely and irretrievably in love with Dr. Thomas. She has been sent down to earth to share her knowledge upon us weaklings and give us the best courses offered at ACC. If you don't like her, there's something wrong with you, not her. Take her class, work hard and go talk to her. You will have done yourself a favor."
619,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328HONORS,5.0,3.0,"The absolute BEST professor I've EVER taken. She is truly passionate about her subject and about her students. Gives wonderful discussion based lectures, 1 group project, 3 papers &amp; 1 research paper. Don't listen to her bullies, she will make you a better student &amp; you won't regret taking her classes. I miss her classes already!"
620,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,5.0,2.0,"This was the 2nd literature course I took from Prof. Thomas, I only took the class because she taught it and she did not let me down. The lectures are intriguing &amp; engaging, we discussed relevant topics that relate to the readings. NO EXAMS, just 3 papers that were not difficult as long as you read. Easy A if you read &amp; fun class overall!"
621,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,2.0,4.0,"Both her syllabus and assignment sheets are unnecessarily long and vague, and the ""feedback"" she leaves on papers is at best unhelpful and at worst demoralizing. Rather than teach new concepts herself, Dr. Thomas assigns group projects and expects students to introduce them, providing no followup whatsoever."
622,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Thomas was easily my favorite teacher at ACC my first year. She's very dedicated to your writing and will help your writing exponentially. I came in as a very mediocre writer and quite frankly didn't enjoy writing, but as I went on with the class I found myself getting better which ultimately made writing more enjoyable. Would recommend!"
623,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Thomas provided an inspiring discussion, tying in moral questions on present issues, while perfectly tailoring it to examine the assigned reading. She provided clear instructions including a handful of prompt ideas for each paper, and was always available to provide guidance. I enjoyed every minute and recommend everyone take a class with her."
624,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,1.0,5.0,"Instructions for the papers are vague and provide little on pattern or process. If you have trouble understanding the story, it's your fault your not a genus. Forget about tutoring, she barely reads your paper or provides instruction, then marks most of it off when graded. This happened for all 3 papers. She marked off what she approved earlier?"
625,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Thomas is an excellent professor; she engages the class and makes the short stories interesting. She is a tough grader, but she always allows revisions. After taking her class, I became much more confident in my writing skills and learned to enjoy the writing process instead of dreading it. Dr. Thomas is by far my favorite professor at ACC."
626,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"I think I'm going to make an A in this class, but man, did I work for it! The feedback on essays really helped me to improve (my Comp 1 class was lame), and I feel prepared for the exam. I'm not sure what the person below is talking about--she uses pretty straightforward weekly modules. And if I ever had a question, she answered emails quickly."
627,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,2.0,3.0,Her website is organized in a way that is very hard to understand. She makes several different word documents per assignment which make it difficult to look at all the necessary material without getting confused or sidetracked.
628,701822,Anne-Marie,Thomas,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,5.0,Pure passion for what she does and genuinely cares about her students success
630,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"Kramer made History interesting. Study for the tests because they're very lecture heavy. He talks pretty fast so get used to the writing. Get to class early because he writes outlines on the board for you. I dropped the class, but he made it really interesting and I still remember a lot from his lectures, 3 years later."
631,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"I took Kramer for History 1301 &amp; 1302 during the online summer sessions. Very lecture heavy with minimal textbook use. Focus on the lectures, get the hang of the questions and youll pass with an A. He tells you what he expects as a professor and offers tutoring time to help with any questions."
632,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"Kramer loves his job and loves history. He is quite the character, but it's because he loves what he does. I would definitely take his class again. It is not an easy class and it's not because of him; it's because the class isn't too easy. If you can, MAKE A STUDY GROUP. If you get a bunch of people to split up the work it is very manageable."
633,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"If you're taking the class just for credit, do not. If you're trying to learn and be challenged, go for it. Professor Kramer is one of the most enthusiastic and charismatic teachers I've ever came across. Lectures are great and the tests are hard but take good notes and study them and you will have no problem making a good grade."
634,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,This is a VERY lecture heavy course from a history lover! Make sure to take detailed notes for every lecture. Prof Kramer basically gives you the questions that will be on the test ahead of time (aka write/study your answers beforehand). Theres really no way to fail unless you dont do the work.
635,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,Trash
636,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,2.0,5.0,"Kramer classes are hard, but I have never learned more in one class than this one, he is extremely knowledgeable. His tests are hard but fair. I thoroughly enjoyed this class!!"
637,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"The lectures are amazing. To get an A in his class you have to write exactly what he said during the lecture and if you miss one small piece you will lose a lot of points. For an A you have to get an overall grade of 90 and an accepted 5-6 pages paper. I noticed, in the tests he ALWAYS chooses 5 questions from the FIRST HALF of the short answers."
638,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"If you want your money's worth take professor Kramer. Yes, you will have to put in effort but it's worth it you will learn a lot about the U.S and it's fragile beginning's.  3 exams w/essay one final essay for an A. * when you get the syllabus go over it before and after each lecture!"
639,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,Lecture intensive class. You will need the textbook in order to pass tests. Professor Kramer is very passionate about History and makes the subject fun to learn. Does not post grades to blackboard.
640,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"Ive taken Kramer for Hist1301 &amp; 1302, hes one of the best professors Ive ever had! His lectures are great and he really makes it interesting. You can tell hes passionate about what he does. Strictly a lecture based class, be prepared to take lots of notes."
641,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,4.0,4.0,"I took Prof. Kramer for Hist 1/2. At first I thought I wouldn't pass &amp; ended up with a B/A. Both courses are the same format. Make a friend you can study/compare notes with. He seems daunting but loves History and his lectures are fantastic. This class requires extensive note taking, I made 3 sep guides per test. You'll only fail from laziness."
642,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,If you really want to learn about history this is the professor you want. I really enjoyed his class because I learned so much and his lectures are super interesting that it makes it easy for you to remember events that happened. He does make you write essays for the exams but if you study and ask questions youll do great.
643,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,"He is truly a great history professor, but he made it difficult for his students to pass the class. There are only 3 exams and your entire grade is based upon them. After the first exam there are no retests. If you actually like history then take this class, otherwise, save your time and money because this class will take up your entire week."
644,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,Very difficult tests. Feels impossible to pass.
645,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"ACC should fire this individual, he expects you to write whatever he says in class. The worst day of my life was when I took his class. No extra credit, do not let you record his lecture, and the book I don't even remember using it."
646,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"He is ALL lecture based, meaning if you miss just a tiny detail you might struggle. hes also really intense"
647,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"This is a lecture based class. Meaning, only what HE says will be covered on tests. Textbook is a waste of money we dont even use it. This profressor is not very good. He expects you to write every single detail he discussed in class on the tests! Which by the way is ALL free response. DO NOT take this class if you value your GPA!"
648,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,3.0,"Although he made lectures interesting, if you missed a word or two you are done for. He does not allow many questions, just gets through the lecture. He doesn't seem to care about you not succeeding. Lots of notes. 3 tests and only one make up. I had to drop the class. Would not recommend if you are bad at history."
649,154112,David,Kramer,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,5.0,"He only gives you 4 tests and your entire grade is based on them. He grades the tests very harshly, and offers no opportunity to bring your grade up. If you are a history major, you might like him because his lectures are great and he is entertaining to listen to. But anyone who struggles with history stay away."
651,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,2.0,3.0,"Dr. Lyn's asynchronous lectures are recorded lectures from a synchronous class, a lot of awkward silence, jokes that don't land, ??'s that aren't relevant to your class. Tons of videos to watch, many redundant. Lots of wasted time and inefficiency. Assigns mandatory group participation on weekends. Wants to seem kind but still somewhat inflexible."
652,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1301,5.0,2.0,This Professor is great! She is so funny and all the tests are open notes online. There is no way anyone should fail this class.
653,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,1.0,3.0,"I would not take Professor Lyn Colangelo again. Professor Colangelo makes rude and inappropriate jokes/comments that make the classroom setting weird and uncomfortable. I felt Professor Colangelo's personality was never genuine, also be aware that Professor Colangelo is extremely strict when it comes to assignments."
654,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,INTROCOMM1311,1.0,3.0,"Honestly the worst professor Ive ever had. She is far from caring and doesnt give clear instructions on assignments, yet she takes off points if you dont complete it the way she wants it. I strongly suggest going with another professor if you could."
655,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,4.0,3.0,Dr Colangelo was very helpful and always gave good feedback on our journals. Course was easy if you really read the readings and watched the videos for each module. It was an easy course and she was very helpful and responds to emails quickly.
656,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1315,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst professor I have had, she has no sense of caring. I had a relative of mine pass away, instead of asking why I couldn't do my speech. She went ahead and dropped me from the class. Worst and most careless professor of all time."
657,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,2.0,"Don't listen to the slackers, this class is insanely easy. Come to class, do your work, and treat her like the professional she is and you'll have an easy A. She gives you the questions before every test which are directly out of the book. She's very accommodating and understanding if you communicate with her. I always looked forward to this class!"
658,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,3.0,3.0,"I wasn't expecting this class to be easy. I also wasn't expecting so many assignments, they aren't all difficult, but sometimes unnecessary &amp; annoying. Unnecessary is a good word for the class actually. There are plenty of tests, a couple of group projects, and the professor is nice but sometimes confusing with instructions and can be misleading."
659,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1315,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Lyn was really great to have as an instructor. She was really responsive and was always helpful when I needed it. As long as you just follow her instructions, you will get an A."
660,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,1.0,5.0,"Professor Colangelo is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. As everyone else has said, DO NOT take her. I am a pre-medical major and this class took by far the most time out of my semester, she thinks that the world revolves around her class and is not understanding at all when it comes to absences, even if it is a medical emergency."
661,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,1.0,4.0,"Prof Colangelo takes a course which should be easy &amp; fun, and makes it miserable. Only course that I dreaded going to this semester, and it wasnt because of the public speaking. It was because you never knew who you were getting that day, fun and chipper, or angry and aggressive. I would NOT recommend this course."
662,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,1.0,5.0,"The materials used in her class was not good. The videos shown are not as funny, even though she thinks it is. When it came to grading, she is very harsh and not specific on what she wants especially on the individual speech we had to do. She also gave a poor example of the individual speech. I would not recommend this teacher to anyone."
663,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,1.0,3.0,"Professor Lyn is scatterbrained. She was all over the place, and very, very vague when giving instructions for our big projects. Would get mad when we did it incorrectly, but we had no guidance. Late almost every class, would be rude to students who were late on days she was early. Very rough on grading. No early turn ins. Very rude with students."
664,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,INTROCOMM1311,5.0,3.0,"She was an amazing teacher who was kind, understanding and patient. She is big on participation, and she grades easily if you try, but if you think she wont notice if you are BSing through the class , she will and she will call you on it. VERY GREAT TEACHER."
665,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,2.0,"Tells it like it is. Show up, so ur hw, and quizzes, and all will be well. Communicates well via email. Will definitely take again"
666,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,3.0,3.0,Professor Lyn was a good instructor. Her class is pretty easy to pass as long as you do the work. There are no in-class tests just quizzes on blackboard due every weekend (you can find all the answers in the textbook). As long as you show up to class and put in an effort you'll be fine. Just don't get on her bad side :)
667,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"Read a lot of bad reviews about Dr. Lyn. She has stated many times she was tired of being the mean strict teacher. I can't even imagine her being like that! She is so amazing, her class work is EASY. She is hilarious and knows a lot about what she is teaching. I would take her again and again if I could. Don't listen to these negative comments."
668,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,INTROCOMM1311,4.0,2.0,She is very clear on what she wants her students to hit when doing a speech. Class was straight forward but she never penalized anyone for asking questions if they needed help. Lots of group activities but met some cool people along the way. As long as you do whats expected you should be good. Grades fairly but also took a summer course.
669,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,3.0,2.0,"Dr. Lynn is certainly an energetic person, and her lectures can sometimes go all over the place. Her grading criteria is pretty straight forward, but make sure to understand what she wants you to do exactly for assignments so you don't miss points for minor things. She really is trying to be more compassionate and patient with students."
670,440513,Lyn,Colangelo,Austin Community College,Communication,SPCH1311,1.0,1.0,"Haven't taken that teacher for classes but communicated once via email and received a very rude reply, I will make sure to never take that teacher's class. Unnecessary rude"
672,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,3.0,4.0,"Tough cookie! Awesome lectures, knows her stuff. Most demanding class, dont know if Im passing. Enjoy watching lectures, but must take notes. Exams are written mostly, so need to study. Group studying helped me due to sharing notes, 1st test. Shes awesome and passionate and doesnt hand out grades. Dont be lazy take good notes and good luck!"
673,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,4.0,4.0,"First time online, tough. Professor Rivera is unique, very interesting lectures, smart. Her tests are no joke and her lectures are intense. two required papers, only 4 pages, not too bad. I enjoy the animation she brings to her lectures, which keeps me interested. Take good notes, need to, I scored a 73 on first exam. Never liked govt until now.."
674,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,1.0,5.0,FOR ALL NVC STUDENTS! she teaches both at ACC and NVC! I recommend you to NOT take this class. She doesn't care about failing you. She has been my absolute worst professor EVER. I wish someone would have told me earlier.
675,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,5.0,4.0,"Passionate! Her lectures are awesome and very interesting. teaches info in a relatable fasion. Two research papers, had 8 weeks 4 each. Is responsive if you reach out to her. Dont be lazy and blame her for your lack of note taking, like a student did in class. No review but take notes and you good. Minute papers cool. I feel ready for university"
676,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,1.0,5.0,HORRIBLE professor. She is VERY opinionated and does not accommodate students requests. Class is very fast paste and the exams are NOTHING like the info we go over in class. Shes very tough on grading and NEVER responds to emails. Told a student that they were getting defensive and in her feels bc they asked her to explain the content better.
677,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,1.0,5.0,"She is an awesome person but an awful professor. She is now teaching at Northwest Vista College and I regret with every fiber of my being taking her class. She is just awful at being a teacher, knowledgeable yes but good at explaining NO. Save yourself and your GPA, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS."
678,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,1.0,3.0,"5 week, online summer class. She had poor communication skills, as it took the first week for her to respond to students. No grades where put in until the day grades where do, so we had no way of knowing if we where doing assignments right. Tests tested specific details in the book. Not a good asynchronous prof. Maybe she's better in person"
679,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,2.0,4.0,"My class was taken amid COVID-19 so that may have affected her teaching, but this was my experience. Through 10 weeks, we maybe had access to lectures and any homework, 2-3 days before due. If you sent her an email with a question, expect a week delay, if you ask for feedback on a paper or hw assignment, accept the fact she will NOT answer ever."
680,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,2.0,5.0,"Professor Rivera would teach good in person instead of online. The organization of the classroom was very unorganized and certain assignments werent visible. Takes a long time to submit grades so you wont know what your grade is prior to the withdrawal date. It WILL take a while to receive feedback on something, so beware of that. Good luck."
681,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVE2350,5.0,3.0,"I really loved this class! It's coming from a Student that got a D final grade. Not so memorable, however, completely worth it. Her class was so interesting, I never got bored, and she continually proved she knew what she was talking about. Respect for her, and her brain!"
682,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,1.0,4.0,Does not submit grades till after withdraw date passed. Hardly any grades submitted even a few days before end of class.
683,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,1.0,4.0,"Had to take online, forcing your students to use a system like Voice Thread is ridiculous. If you arent comfortable with a webcam, sucks to be you. Research Papers are too difficult when there is no relatable substance from class material and lectures. This teacher tends to push her own political views in these papers."
684,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,3.0,3.0,This professor did get straight to the point. She was a good professor to have fun with but during the start of the semester she was kinda mean to the class. There were two major essays that are 40% of the grade and three exams but only two count towards your grade. Don't take this class if you have alot on your plate it will only make it worse
685,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,5.0,4.0,"This has been my favorite professor so far. Extra credit available. People who failed this class stayed through the semester just to attend lecture, seriously. Love her or hate her. She's fair and she makes you work for it. The lectures are exciting and engaging. Extremely good at delivering her points and making the material animated."
686,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,4.0,4.0,"She's amazing. I love going to her class. She requires a book but you'll almost never use it the tests are 100% from lectures. She talks really fast and you can't use a laptop in her class. In other words, be ready for your hand to fall off. You actually get to learn things from her."
687,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVTTEX,1.0,5.0,"Didnt like her or her teaching style, good luck if you take her"
688,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOV1302,2.0,4.0,Don't take her if you're just in it for a gov credit. This class took up much more of my time than I anticipated because the exams are lengthy and require memorizing everything in detail. The effort to get even a B was not worth it for a class I don't care about.
689,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,4.0,She's can be a real serious and seem a bit scary at first because she's a no joke professor. Her classes consist of 3 tests (she drops the lowest one at the end of the semester) and 2 research papers plus participation. I would only take her class if your willing to work for your grade. But she will answer any questions you have and help you.
690,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,3.0,4.0,Professor Rivera knows a lot and asks if we have questions every class and answers them the next day. We had to write every day in class and attendance every day matters to her. The biggest disappointment was her not passing back any grades ever. It is now the end of the semester and no one in the class knows their grades.
691,1120741,Anaka,Rivera,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,2.0,5.0,"Professor Rivera is VERY knowledgeable. However, her style of teaching isn't concrete... sometimes it is a lecture aided by powerpoint (preferable), while MOST others are ""off-the-cuff"" and take wild tangents. Her delivery is very fast and the inaccessibility to review a powerpoint after classes to supplement the notes you missed makes it tough"
693,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYCH2301,4.0,3.0,"This class was fairly straight forward, it was a distance learning course so Dr. Hattoh didn't have lectures. listen to the powerpoints and read confusing topics. Tests are pretty easy and when you do the study guide look at PowerPoint notes and textbook. study guides are topics that are covered on the test and you apply scenarios to the situations"
694,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PHYSC1301,5.0,3.0,"Dr Hattoh is such a nice and kind lady, took her class in summer is basically read at your own pace, study her power points and email her if you have questions. We just had four exams and an extra credit no quizzes because is a 5 week session. I will definetly take her again!"
695,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"During COVID-19 it was difficult to stay motivated but her work that she gave was easy, if you read the textbook that she provides it will be super easy to pass this class, she also provides opportunities for extra credit :). I will definitely take this class again to do better even tough it was easy to get an A."
696,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"There was 4 tests and 4 quizzes for this class. The tests weren't that hard, she'll give you a list of what you need to study for each chapter. The quizzes are extra credit. She will give you a code to access to online textbook so you don't need to buy textbook."
697,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PHSYC1301,4.0,2.0,Professor Hattoh is so knowledgable and gifted. Her lectures in class are mandatory but are easy to understand and follow along with. She has all of her lectures posted on Blackboard ahead of time and explains them throughout the class with all sorts of stories and analogies. I was hesitant about the class at first but happy I took the class!
698,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,Professor Hattoh gave clear instructions at the beginning of what she expected of you during the semester. Her test were easy and exactly like the study guides. Passed with an A extra credit for doing weekly quizzes online plus if you havent missed a day.
699,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Hattoh is a straight forward teacher. She has a very thick accent so her teaching style is slower to make sure everyone understands. Her in-class PowerPoints include more info, so I recommend going to class. Tests are based off of examples so you should really study and understand your notes. She has plenty of opportunities for extra credit."
700,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,Highly recommend
701,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC1301,5.0,2.0,She is great. Try in her class and you will get an A
702,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC1301,4.0,3.0,"WARNING: She is from Ghana, so her accent is heavy. Try not to over complicate your questions as she sometimes has trouble understanding, but for the most part, she gets it. She's a good teacher with a good sense of humor and she really likes psychology. She cares about her students and their grades. Her class is worth taking."
703,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,3.0,"Be prepared to take notes. However, 85% of the information provided by her you will see on the test and her quizzes. There was usually a quiz once a week. Her grading criteria was very clear. Must attend class."
704,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hattoh is very kind, if you study for the tests and quizzes youll get an A"
705,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"Really great professor, her class is very organized and you know what you're getting into at the beginning of the semester. Pay attention and go over terms for test and quizzes."
706,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PHSYC1301,5.0,2.0,"Really such a lovely, kind woman. Her lectures are interesting, informative and organized. She gives a study guide for each test and each quiz. If you learn the material on the guides, you will do really well! Just make sure to pay attention during her lectures and make it to class! I really enjoyed having Ms. Hattoh as my professor."
707,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,2.0,All notes are online and she gives extra credit for perfect attendance and online quizzes (which you get 3 attempts on each to get a 100). Reviews directly reflect what's going to be on the test!
708,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,3.0,Easy A. Multiple choice exams. I made flash cards with the reviews she gave out &amp; aced every exam. Didnt buy the textbook either.
709,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,Dr. Hattoh is a gem. She's very passionate about psychology and definitely shows through her lectures. The only thing is she does randomly call on students often which I know is pretty anxiety inducing for a lot of people. But she loves answering (on topic!) questions. Do the reading quizzes and reviews!
710,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"She is sweet, however she does need you to do the work, she lays out clear instructions on what she expects, do the work -you will pass. Attach meaning to your readings and you will pass. Show up to class and you will pass. The work is on you .. and you will pass."
711,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PHSYC1301,3.0,4.0,"Not an easy A, but requires studying and paying attention in class"
712,992509,Rose,Hattoh,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,4.0,2.0,Her exams are all multiple questions from review sheets. Nice caring professor.
714,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,3.0,"I LOVE when a professor is clear and organized, and Dr. Hawk definitely delivers! Her lectures are organized and interesting, and her slides are available on BB. She has mandatory weekly Discussion Board posts about the chapters for the following week (so she forces you to read for the week ahead, something you should already be doing)."
715,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,3.0,"I highly recommend Dr. Hawk, she goes out of her way to make sure you are taken care of in the class. Due to COVID, I took an online summer class. I loved this class, I learned so much. She is so organized online, everything is laid out nicely. She is so caring and really wants her students to succeed. This was by far my favorite class ever taken."
716,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,1.0,"did the 5 week summer class, she opened it up 2 weeks early! when you buy launchpad you get the e text. We had about 25 assignments due every week but it was a mix of learning curves, chapter quizzes, video activitys and one discussion set every week. She had 3 times for office hours every week but hardly anyone got on, shes so sweet to talk too!!!"
717,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2314,5.0,5.0,"THE best online class i have ever taken. I took the 5 week summer class and she opened it up 2 weeks early! I dont suggest buying the physical textbook because when you buy launchpad you get the e text. We had about 25 assignments due every week but it was a mix of learning curves, chapter quizzes, video activitys and one discussion set every week"
718,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,4.0,2.0,"I loved Dr. Hawk! She gives you a clear idea of what you need to do, and if you complete the work you will get an A. She even lets you turn in late assignments for partial credit. She was great!!"
719,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,1.0,"Very wonderful professor. I ran into tech support problems half way through the course and she said don't worry about it, I'll still get a grade for what I've done. Each week you're given 2 chapters to read and most of the time a discussion board post. Quizlet is your friend, and no ""tests"" but a quiz with each chapter. I highly recommend!"
720,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hawk is very nice and humble. She is always in a good mood and bright which brushes off on anyone who's having a bad day. Very clear grading criteria, would've got an A, but missed a few homeworks and exams were a bit challenging so do study unlike me (procrastinate). Overall, would recommend!"
721,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2314,4.0,1.0,Simple course - no exams! I finished the course a month and a half early - just completing online homework assignments and blackboard discussion posts &amp; responses. She responds to emails consistently if you have any questions. Super easy A!
722,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYCH2314,4.0,2.0,"I took her online class for Human Growth and Development, it couldn't have been easier. With that being said, you do two chapters a week, so much reading. Don't buy the book, it's included with online access code you buy. I would have liked taking this class on campus better. She was so kind and always gave feedback."
723,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2301,2.0,4.0,I would say to someone thinking of taking this class... just don't. Choose someone else.
724,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,2.0,I took her for the 8 week Online course and I HIGHLY recommend taking her! The class was very easy and the grading criteria is very clear. This class is honestly an easy A and the only reason I did not get an A is because I did not turn in 2 essays and I still got a B+! Pros: Easy Class &amp; NO TESTS! Cons: Weekly essays
725,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"Great class, I had to do hw a few nights a week-- but only for a 20 minutes or so. Quizlet was a major help."
726,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,2.0,"Took her for Lifespan and Development Psych online. Didn't really need the book because the online access code also gave access to the online book. Clear grading criteria. Work at you own pace but with set deadlines for certain chapters. Discussion boards every week or two, but can turn in late for partial credit. Awesome class!!"
727,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,"Such a nice professor, she really does want everyone to pass. Very good at responding to emails and questions. Book is required along with online code ($75). LOTS of reading but definitely worth taking her class!"
728,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful professor! I took her during the summer, there's readings, tests, discussions and journals due each week. Sounds like a lot, but it was actually pretty easy. She explains her lectures very well and she wants all of her students to pass. I would def recommend her to anyone who is needing to take the class."
729,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,"Extremely easy class and great professor! I had taken Intro to Psych previously and gotten a C but wanted to retake it to make an A instead. I signed up for Hawk's online class and was able to almost all of the work done within the first two weeks, being able to work at my own pace. I highly recommend taking her!"
730,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,2.0,"Class is pretty straight forward. You have to read two chapters a week, take a quiz for each chapter, write in a discussion board and write an 800 word paper on what you found interesting in the chapters. It's a lot of reading but you learn a lot and you get an easy A just by talking about what you learned and what you think about the material."
731,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,3.0,Dr. Hawk is very compassionate about her field and makes it clear in her emails when she addresses her students. She is very fair and also so sweet and helpful. She is ALWAYS available and makes it clear that she wants her students to ask questions. She gives great feedback as well! Very respected and taught me a lot.
732,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSY2314,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Hawk is extremely knowledgeable about her field. She's very wise and willing to help you apply situations in your life to your studies. She wants active participation while she's lecturing, which is why her class became annoying towards the end, but overall, it was a great semester. Textbook required to complete journals and discussion posts."
733,1018397,Carol,Hawk,Austin Community College,Psychology,PSYCH2314,5.0,2.0,"Pretty easy A as long as you keep up with deadlines. Mostly online modules - you don't need to buy the textbook if you just buy an access code, since the whole book is in the software. Discussion boards every few weeks, and you get credit so long as you meet the word count. Easy 500 word journal."
735,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,4.0,"Dont waste your time. She requires everyone to buy a textbook that is online only, that SHE wrote herself (poorly) plus you have assignments that can only be turned in through that website so it is necessary. Very unorganized, she contradicts herself frequently but talks to you like its your fault. Pointless busywork. She should be ashamed."
736,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHIC1301,1.0,4.0,"She gives several assignments to do in one week, you have to but her own written textbook if not you will definitely fail the class. The textbook is poorly written and disorganized, as well as assignments given can be extremely confusing on how disorganized everything is. I have to take the class again but definitely with another professor."
737,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,4.0,"If taken alone, it might be doable. She gives so many assignments and expects you to teach yourself with her self written book. She doesnt provide recorded lectures and the content is unorganized and extremely confusing how she laid it out. I have one degree already and consider myself a decent student. I regret taking her!"
738,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHIC1301,1.0,4.0,"She emailed me saying she gave me the wrong grade. 2 months later she still hasn't corrected it. Now I have to re-take to transfer. No lectures, a lot of homework due almost every day of the week. Doesn't grade until semester is over."
739,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHIC1301,2.0,5.0,I took the 5 week course during the summer and had a midterm then the final the next week. I understand 5 week courses are packed but she made it very work heavy. She makes it feel like you cannot reach out to her and like youre on your own so I recommend reaching out and making a friend in this class. - or not taking this professor.
740,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor ever. No grades on anything does not answer emails, so NO idea how youre doing. When I got my grade for a paper after class ended, she said I need to define some terms, which I did. When I defined them she told me there was no need to define. No lectures. Her quizzes on her book do not relate. Do yourself a favor and stay away."
741,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,5.0,"I took the 5-week ethics class and it was extremely difficult. She required us to buy her book, which is super wordy and full of grammatical/spelling errors. There are bolded vocab words but no definitions. Her instructions are often unclear and when students ask questions she just refers them to the syllabus. Avoid this class if you can."
742,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHICS2306,1.0,4.0,"Took this professor my Spring 2020 semester and she was probably one of the worst professors I've ever had. Her ""textbook"" is unfinished and disorganized, and yet she still gives discussion questions on it when the answers are hardly in the textbook, She gives lots of homework and projects that are unnecessary. Do not take her."
743,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,3.0,4.0,"I took her online 5-week class and it was very rough, you will not hear from her often but she will respond quick if you email her. The class has a lot of reading which is not too bad but a lot of interpretations you would have to come up yourself since she is not very interactive. Make sure you do all of the discussion boards and take the quiz."
744,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHICS2306,1.0,4.0,"Extremely disorganized. All the negative reviews on here are spot on. I got an A in this class, yet it still felt like a complete waste. Do yourself a favor and avoid her at all costs."
745,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHICS2306,1.0,5.0,"If you are a busy student with kids and a full time job, AVOID this professor. She wrote her own texbook, very confusing to read. Lot of assignments, Lot of reading, volunteer assignment for 6hrs, quiz every wk. Reflection questions weekly, Exams are all essay questions, no multiple choice. She should be teaching at UT not a community college"
746,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,"Professor Crispino was completely unorganized. We were often given lectures and material for the homework/tests a couple of days before it was due, which gave little time to study. She writes her textbook herself and it is unbearable and very confusing. She does give a lot of extra credit opportunities, though. I didn't learn much at all."
747,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,4.0,3.0,"I know Professor Crispino is getting a lot of negative reviews on here, but I actually ended up doing well in this class. Make sure to watch her lectures because the answers for the tests or quizzes are there if you listen. She's willing to work with you if you talk to her personally and she at least shown me that she genuinely cares for students."
748,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,4.0,"I feel really bad making this review because she's very nice but super unorganized and gives way too much ""busy"" work. I left this class not learning a thing. If it wasn't for the help of my classmates I think I would've done much worse. Luckily, I think most of the grades were for participation."
749,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,LOGIC2303,1.0,3.0,"She is very disorganized, the web tutor link frequently doesn't work and she missed class often. The professor's frequent absences made learning extremely choppy, often the sub wasn't on the same page. I regret taking this class with her. Also her lectures are unpleasant to sit through, it's like listening to fingernails on the chalkboard."
750,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHICS2306,1.0,5.0,"This was absolutely the worst online class I have ever taken. She is very disorganized. Half of the links didn't work, she didn't give clear instructions for the homework assignments (then posted after the assignments were due that she should have explained better), the book is hard to understand (she wrote it). Would not recommend her to anyone"
751,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHICS2306,5.0,3.0,"She was very nice, but if trying to counter her theory or philosophies then things can get disturbing so just agree to her lectures and her way of thinking. Disorganized and cancelled class (no complains about that, plus she told us that since the first day) due to her illness. Overall interesting concepts that are mesmerizing, would recommend her!"
752,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,3.0,"Cripsino is very disorganized, but she is a great professor. I bought the book thinking we would need it, but I never read and passed with an A in the class. If you don't read and attend class then you'll be fine. She is writing her own book that she is going to be using in the class so things might change drastically."
753,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,LOGIC1301,2.0,4.0,She makes a lot of mistakes and skips a lot of classes. She falsely claims that the class gets easier as the semester goes on. She gave an exam in which 1/2 the questions were over concepts we hadn't covered then told us it was our fault. She has an exam scheduled for after the semester is over. She uses a bad textbook because her friends wrote it
754,1184455,Azzurra,Crispino,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,4.0,2.0,"She is great when it comes to actual class discussions and conversing with students. However, her calendar could be much better. It is in an awkward table online when it could be more organized in a PDF format. Furthermore, the BlackBoard material is hard to find. A quiz may be in an unrelated unit, and she rarely gives a heads up with HW."
756,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,2.0,He's one of the best math teachers I've ever had. Unfortunately I dropped out of his class due to family reasons but his teaching style is amazing. Not only a great professor but a great person. Truly wish more math teachers were like him. He assigns homework each week but it's helpful and he explains concepts thoroughly in class! Plus great humor!
757,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MAT1342,5.0,4.0,Great teacher and great person. I just hate stats!! Wanted to fall asleep all the time but he did very good at explaining things and offered a lot of help on hw and will take the time to answer questions and even conversation. Taken during COVID and he is the best Ive had to handle it all so far
758,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,STATISTICS,5.0,3.0,I would recommend this class to anyone needing to take stats. He is so nice and by far the best professor I have taken so far. He cares about your grade and is willing to help with whatever youre not understanding. He covers everything you will need to know on tests too! They can be tough but math can be tough in general.
759,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,2.0,"Best professor at ACC for sure. So much to learn from him, because he is really really smart. He has a great sense of humor and excellent speaking skills. He talks like a professional Youtuber. If you like Math and feel confident with Statistics, you might not need to pay for the textbook, there's a free version on the Internet, look it up."
760,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Most students don't take math just for fun, but Kris does make it a fun class! Very caring, will answer all questions, guide you through the scary formulas and concepts. Wont brush you off but will make sure you are getting it. A decent amount of HW takes some time but really-really helps to practice and feel confident and prepared for tests."
761,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,This is by far the best professor I have had at ACC. As long as you answer all homework questions you get a 100. The pretest help you to prepare for the exams. There are 4 exams total that you can either take during class time by Skype or the lockdown browser through BB (recorded). I was very unsure about taking this class but he made it easy.
762,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,I took his online class during COVID but he allowed us to attend his class sessions online. All lectures are recorded and you can watch later but during his live classes you can get help on questions after. Book is required. Do ALL HW PROBLEMS and PRACTICE EXAMS thank me later. Very caring and will explain it until you understand. Highly recommend
763,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,I am a 9th grader taking dual credit at this school and math is my weak point. The lectures that he gave supplemented by the solution and section goals videos in WileyPlus were phenomenal. Contacting for questions is also very easy. I cannot think about anything bad about this professor!
764,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,He is far one of the best professors Ive had! I had to retake math and all I can say is that he makes everything more clear and easy to understand to where I enjoy math because I understand it! I highly recommend him if you have to take a math class.
765,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"He's the best! Explains things so well, does not make you feel idiotic if you don't understand, just patiently re-explains, and helps you through it. Provides video lectures that you can go back and watch if you forget something. Practice tests that prep you for exams. Gives real world examples to help you remember later what you learned. Amazing!"
766,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MAT1342,5.0,2.0,"Professor Marcus was awesome! I took the class online and it was a breeze. He posts everything you need for the course and is good at responding to emails. I found the book for free online, so no need to buy. There is quit a bit of hw (that prepares you for exams) but it is simple if you watch the lecture videos he posts on blackboard. TAKE HIM!!!!"
767,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"I love Professor Marcus. I hadn't taken a math class in almost 3 years and he made college algebra so simple to understand, and his lectures were great. He really cares for his students and understands us. When COVID happened, switching to online class wasn't difficult at all. I highly recommend him as a professor to anyone, he's definitely a fave"
768,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Kris goes above and beyond for his students and even students who aren't in his class. he has a youtube channel, The Math Informant, (MI) and personal MI website where he has recorded lectures and other assorted explanations, he tutors outside class, and never has morning classes. he even took on extra classes for another prof during covid-19."
769,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"He creates a rapport with students, makes class a safe place to ask questions, gives 5min breaks after 45min of work, always makes us laugh. Ive learned sm more than I signed up for. He keeps notes fun, and easy to understand, made the transition to online. Ive said it before Ill say it again, this man is my favorite man. (No hetero Im a lesbian)"
770,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,4.0,2.0,"He goes the extra mile for his students, Records the lecture and notes and posts them. He grades things individually so he can see what you messed up on during the math process. Medium amount of HW but all odd #s at the back of the text book."
771,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,"He was fantastic! Helpfully, explains things in a useful way, easy to understand, good feedback. I wish I could take another Stats class w/ him."
772,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"So much to say, but only 350 characters to say it in... Very clear on everything, repeats as necessary, patient, individualized attention, classes are recorded and well-presented, extremely well organized, the only math teacher I would go back and take any math (uhh!) class from, and I've had a few ."
773,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"Really liked this class. I'm not math-phobic nor am I great at math, but i made a really good score in this class because he teaches it well. No sweat if you miss a lecture or two, they're all online. Pretty easy grader, will give partial credit (if you don't leave something blank). Fun teacher, easy going and likes to make jokes and share trivia."
774,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MAT1342,5.0,4.0,Amazing professor. 4 exams and a lot of homework. The homework helps to prepare you for the exams. Took the class online and it went great than expected. Lectures are recorded and posted for you. Professor Marcus provides everything you need to succeed in the class but you do have to work for a good grade. I definitely recommend him.
775,1837871,Kristopher,Marcus,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"I took the online course. He posts videos of the lectures, which are helpful, since you can watch them as many times as you need. Lectures are clear. Lots of homework. He provides study guides for exams. Do them, since the exams are similar. Only thing is that he can take a while to email you back because he is busy teaching multiple courses."
777,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1111,3.0,1.0,"Pretty standard and easy lab class. It was difficult to understand him over computer audio. Overall, pretty easy and straightforward professor you cannot go wrong with."
778,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,3.0,2.0,"This class is an Easy A as the tests come straight from the review, but be prepared to teach yourself EVERYTHING if you actually want to learn. The professor is very unorganized and has no plan for each lecture."
779,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1305,3.0,3.0,"Not easy to communicate with, but he does his best... your grade will rely on your test scores so STUDY the review he gives you very well and you'll pass no problem--but they can be very time consuming as the reviews can range from 50 to 120 questions long. Do not miss class or you will be lost! He gives you bonus points for perfect attendance."
780,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Uzomba is the best Chemistry teacher at ACC at the moment. His tests are multiple choice and easy to get an A. His class is the best class i have ever taken and i am not sure i will ever come across any nice, smart and caring professor like Dr. Uzomba. On a scale of 10 i rate him 10"
781,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,2.0,4.0,Strong accent makes it difficult to understand at some concepts. However main issue was that if you don't already know the subject you will not pass as he already expects you to know it.
782,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1305,1.0,4.0,"In class, he was clear for the most part and always encouraged questions, but when myself or someone around me asked a question he would make us feel uneducated and that we didn't belong in his class if we didn't understand that concept immediately. I will say though that if you put in the work and STUDY you will pass."
783,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1401,4.0,2.0,Isnt always the best at communicating. I took him for lab and found myself and others often confused. However he is a kind teacher and was willing to curve grades if he saw the whole class struggling with a subject. Wasnt very clear on the grading criteria to the point nobody knew if we had a lab final until the lab before. (We didnt)
784,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,5.0,Uzomba is a fantastic Professor. Pretty much a crazy Genius. Focus and take all the notes you can. Real Step Up would be getting him a bottle of Brandy on the first/Last Day of Class. He wants to Help you if you let him.
785,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,3.0,4.0,"Very intense Chem class, with grade only determined by tests &amp; final. My average for each test taken was almost 3 hours!!! DO NOT MISS CLASS or you will be lost. Uzomba goes very fast, but has great insight/shortcuts. I only say that I would take this professor again because he is a hilarious character &amp; very smart professor"
786,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,1.0,5.0,"Great sense of humor and personality, but not so great teacher. Tests were multiple choice, so no extra credit. His accent wasn't the issue at all- it was the way he explained the concepts. I dropped and I am doing better with another professor. His teaching style just didn't jive with me. Exams make up entire grade- no extra credit, homework, etc."
787,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,Wonderful teacher if you don't have trouble understanding accents.
788,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1305,2.0,5.0,"This teacher is downright demeaning. He lectures in a yelling voice, encourages you to ask questions but gets mad when things get slowed down and no one understands what hes talking about. Concepts that he made so difficult were explained perfectly on YouTube. Hes a terrible explainer, sadly. Hes too advanced to teach down. Waste of my time."
789,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1305,4.0,4.0,"Uzomba was a little hard to understand at times with his accent. but he's very funny, super nice, and made class entertaining. Subject matter was hard and he wasn't the BEST at explaining, but he makes the tests based on the study guides, so as long as you DO THEM front to back, you will do well on the exams. he'll help you when you need it."
790,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,Great Prof.
791,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1305,2.0,4.0,"Professor Uzomba is funny,but not the best teacher. Love him but not as a professor. He teaches as if we already get the concepts. Accent sometimes hard to understand. To sum up this class, everything on our tests- I taught MYSELF, OUTSIDE of class. Using his study guides, I learned the material via youtube, google, class notes, &amp; book."
792,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1101,5.0,3.0,"Great professor !! If you want to have fun while learning chem, take him. If you are willing to  go to class and keep up with the material take him !! He makes hard concepts easy."
793,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,This professor is remarkably good.  I don't understand what  these students are saying.  If they did poorly its  because wanted to !  If you go to lecture and do the reviews you are sure to get the concepts and an A. He has a passion for chemistry and very good teaching skills. I'm taking ochem II now and Dr Uzomba gave me  a solid  foundation.
794,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1305,2.0,3.0,Took Uzomba for intro to chem. He holds two Chemistry PhDs and DOES NOT know how to teach down. He taught like we all knew what he was talking about. No homework but for an introductory class the prof should use something to know where students are with the concepts. The tests were the same as the reviews so everyone passed by memorizing answers.
795,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,3.0,4.0,Haven't had chem in 15 yrs.  I worked my a** off in this class &amp; spent at least 12-15 hrs a week in learning labs getting help w/reviews.  He gives 3 points to your final score for not missing any classes (and he takes role).  If you can do the reviews (expect numbers to change) then you can get an A.  Took effort but tests are just like reviews.
796,253509,Cyriacus,Uzomba,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,2.0,5.0,"He is happy and upbeat, but, for me, he moved too fast to understand anything and seemed to purposefully ask us to solve problems in class that we did not yet have the knowledge / tools to solve.  He seemed to care very little for our ability to understand the material. If it hadn't been for the learning labs, I doubt I would have passed."
798,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,1.0,5.0,"Unclear about this class, I wish it had some type of power points or something to keep me on track. Only 2 exams and yes there is a credit curve but that did not help me. Wording of exams were weird and I did not do so well. He told me this class was not for me and he was not the professor for me."
799,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,5.0,2.0,"Only had 2 tests the whole course, no homework, no quizzes, etc. It was very easy to pass the test because he would specifically say ""this will be on the test."" His lectures were very easy to follow. He was fun and nice teacher. Not to mention he let us out of class so early, it really spoils you from other professors!"
800,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,1.0,5.0,"I started off wanting to like the class, but there wasnt even a class to like. Let me explain. He would start lecture, write 1-2 things down and dismiss us. Normally that would be cool, but not for something as complex as Economics. Two tests are the only grades. Total of roughly 300 points all together. You fail if you fail one test. Dont take"
801,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,2.0,4.0,"1 of my worst teachers I had. NEVER lectures about econ,always talkin about ""good old days""&amp; has 1 note before dismissing. 2 tests,hard &amp; gives STACK of ""useful"" packets to study with. moved to online b/c corona but gave us 9 quizzes all graded as a TEST w/out warning. Qts obvious copy&amp;paste &amp; tweaked,so some were wrong. Emailed him&amp;he denied it"
802,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECOM2301,4.0,4.0,"Your grade is based on two tests! His lectures are super funny, although he does go a bit fast. He gives plenty of extra credit on the test and even provides a study guide before the test! Clearly tells you what is going to be tested, but you have to study and understand the content to earn an A!"
803,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON1302,5.0,3.0,"Took the class in the summer and it was very chill. There are only two tests and no hw or quizzes. The first one is really easy, but the second one not as much. Do really good on the first test and the second test you won't have to stress as much. I just took notes and recorded his lectures on my phone to hear for important stuff and I got an A"
804,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON1302,4.0,3.0,"The class was very relaxed with only two tests. The first test is easier than the second so be sure to get a good grade on the first one. He's a funny, easygoing guy and lectures were interesting. He gives you packets for material. I passed without the book, but the book might be helpful to get. There's no homework, but there's practice tests."
805,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECO2301,4.0,4.0,"This is the chillest class I ever had! It's up to you if you want to get a good grade or not! If you want to get an A, pay attention because he tells you exactly what will be on the test. NO HW/QUIZ. If you are a self learner, this is the right class for you! EASY A as long as you are willing to work for it!"
806,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECOM2301,3.0,3.0,"IMPORTANT: -ONLY 2 TESTS, NO other grades. You get plenty of study material, which you HAVE to do in order to pass. No extra credit. -Book is optional, but id recommend getting it anyway. This material is well explained it class, but you'll need the extra examples. -Teacher does not use black board to post grade -Fun class to take, but you cant sla"
807,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,5.0,2.0,Al is a great professor. He is funny and makes jokes due to his theory of having a mental break every 20 minutes to increase information retainment. Going to take him again for sure.
808,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECOM2301,5.0,1.0,"I took professor Slivinski for Macro and Micro. Gosh, he is amazing it is an honor to take a class with him. Just study and write notes and you will take an A."
809,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,3.0,3.0,"Good professor, lectures can be kinda boring. He gives handouts that will be used to study for the tests. Only 2 tests, DO THE REVIEW! i recommend going over it well before the test so you have an idea of what to expect. He tells you exactly how many questions are on the tests the class before the exam. Test curve."
810,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECO2302,4.0,4.0,"Al is quite a character. His lectures are funny, but can be off topic at times, and you can tell he cares about what he's teaching. Most of what you will need to succeed is given to you by Al. I would recommend reading the book too. Two tests in the class. First test is pretty easy, Second test is a harder but not impossible. He is a fair grader."
811,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,5.0,3.0,"You will never meet a man as practical as this professor. He attempts to create a stress-free atmosphere and an environment filled with real world examples, and he does not fail to do so successfully. He only grades on 2 exams, and while you have to work for them, you will never come across any trick questions. Take his classes!"
812,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,5.0,3.0,he is amazing and tells great stories. his tests are not difficult. the first one is easy and the 2nd you gotta work for it. I feel like you definitely need the book. He goes over the material like you already know it. However he is available if you need extra help. overall amazing class!!!
813,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,4.0,2.0,"Goes off topic, but tells great stories. Only had two tests so make sure to study. The worksheets are useful. The class before the test he tells you whats on it, so make sure to write it down. The second test is a lot harder than the first. You get an index card for the second. Practice tests help if you are totally lost/need points. 40 pt curve"
814,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECOM2301,2.0,4.0,"He goes off topic a lot. His lectures can be tough to follow. 10% of his lectures are need to know and are needed for exams. the rest is his views on politics. You're only graded on two tests, so the pressure is on. You don't need the book for the class; he gives you so many handouts it can be easy to lose track of."
815,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECON2301,5.0,2.0,"He is definitely one of the best professors I've ever had in ACC! He has a 20 points curve on both tests. If you print out his test reviews and study those, you'll be fine. Listen when he says what's going to be on the test and read the notes carefully. You can bring a written index card to final test. So easy to make an A in his class. He rocks!"
816,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECO2302,5.0,2.0,"Only two tests, but you can make a total of 240 points on them, so the final grade is still out of 200 points, but you get an extra 40 points to help you out. His lectures and handouts are really all you need and as long as you read those and pay attention then you're golden."
817,1132948,Alec,Slivinske,Austin Community College,Economics,ECO2302,4.0,2.0,"If you show up every class and you take notes, you will 100% pass the class. He will tell you what will be on the test, and how to answer. TAKE NOTES. Easy A."
819,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1402,5.0,4.0,Hard class material wise but Prof. Loc makes it a successful and good learning experience under the circumstances and limitations . there is plenty of time for questions as well extra time on exams. 1402 would have been a giant confusing mess for me without his lectures and explanations .
820,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1402,5.0,3.0,"Took both PHYS 1401 and PHYS 1402 classes with him this summer. Lectures were pretty simple to comprehend. He chose the content that was relevant and informative. Tests were surprisingly easy (easier than homework). Lab vids were quick and straightforward, but you had to watch closely maybe rewind or youd miss something for your calculations etc."
821,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,3.0,Fast paced but really nice class. Labs &amp; homework have flexible schedule. Wish I had signed up for his 1402 class as well
822,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,3.0,"Just finished this 5-week class. Prof. Loc makes physics understandable, less mysterious, and low stress. Lectures are done real time on BB Whiteboard and are recorded. He uses a pen tablet and video clips for demos and for the lab experiments. Problems are explained thoroughly and in detail. Tests are on the simple side, moderate and 100% doable."
823,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,3.0,"Great guy, Good choice if you know Basic Physics plus a Calculus class (only used sometimes). Reasonable expectations of students."
824,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,3.0,5.0,prof. loc means well but his lectures are like a crash course in engr phys. he barely goes through the material and does problems for most of the class time. definitely read the chapters beforehand if you want his notes to make any sense. he had a hard time moving the class online (bc of covid) which made it a lot harder to follow his lectures
825,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1410,5.0,2.0,"I needed this class Phys 1410 to fullfill a prerequisite and was not disappointed. I feel that it was time well spent, and I learned much as well."
826,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,4.0,"Very good physics prof, he doesnt spend much time on mathematical derivations and theory its all practical examples. We moved to Blackboard for stay at home. He generously wrote out the lectures in detail and uploaded them, knowing some people had connectivity issues."
827,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1410,5.0,3.0,"He has a great way to explain and I really enjoyed his lectures, both in person and online during the horrible shutdown. Very nice and accommodating professor."
828,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,3.0,5.0,"As long as you do the homework and lab reports and show up to class, you're basically guaranteed a B in the class. However, if you actually are trying to understand Mechanics, this is definitely not the class to take. Once we shifted online due to the pandemic, several technical issues arose severely hindering our ability to grasp the material."
829,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2525,5.0,3.0,"He is a really good physics teacher and a kind man who understands that main purpose is to learn, not just to present your works in time. I was behind in physics lab report but he said, ""take your time and turn it in before finals and it will be okay"". His lectures were amazing and he gives partial credit if you attempt problems in test..."
830,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,3.0,"He stresses the fundamentals and uses the board heavily. There are few PowerPoints. You have to show your homework in hardcopy. Review days have hints and tell you what to skip. Labs are basically participation, great lab techs make everything go fast. Overall a very good class and a great teacher."
831,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,3.0,"Do not underestimate this course. Make time for this class. The material is difficult. Loc is always available to answer questions and he really wants everyone to do well. He's a fair grader but his tests are hard. 70-80% are word problems. 20-30% are MC. Study in class notes, the book examples, the homework. Show up to class / labs. Good Luck!"
832,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,4.0,"Great professor for calc physics. Super clear and practical oriented. Lectures are a bit on the fast side but always to the point and useful, without stories or anecdotes. He gives a lot of cushion for exams, and the free points from the non exam parts will make a difference in your grade. Final is a breeze. Definite recommend!"
833,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,3.0,Mr. Loc is a highly competent teacher. He does a great job explaining the problems and the principles. He turns what could potentially be a hard to pass class into a positive experience. Everything in the syllabus is reasonable and doable. I would take him again for PHYS 2426 if he teaches it next summer.
834,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2425,5.0,4.0,Methodical and really knows his stuff. Teaches by examples which are very easy to understand. Doesnt waste time on items he wont test you on. Grading policies are fair and generous. Super glad I ended up in his class.
835,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,2.0,He makes it easy and simple to learn. Nice and VERY quick class!!
836,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS1401,5.0,4.0,"6 week summer course, coming to class is very important. (attendance is a small portion of grade) Teaches off of the textbook, always open to questions and helps you work out homework problems. Plenty of time given for exams."
837,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2426,5.0,5.0,"A truly difficult class that has a lot of - very - confusing rules and equations... I struggled at the beginning because I had forgotten some stuff, but it turned out well... His explanations and his being available really helped me achieve a good grade that I wanted and worked for."
838,1450231,Leo,Loc,Austin Community College,Physics,PHYS2426,5.0,4.0,"Medium tough midterms, but quick and easy final. No makeups or extra credit. Very reasonable about lab and homework. Lectures you dont have to attend but if he writes down something on the board you can bet hell ask you about it on the exams. This from taking both Eng. Phys. classes with him and both times I got an A. He is a very good professor."
840,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,OCHEM2323,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sackett is one of the best professors - obviously because I'm doing this review mid semester, confidently. She is always helpful, is never condescending, and her lectures are extremely clear. Dr. Sackett made organic chemistry easy &amp; manageable. Theres HW with answers, &amp; the tests are exactly like the HW. Take her, seriously, she's amazing!"
841,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM2325,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Sackett for both o-chems. She was my favorite professor for any subject, at any higher education facility. (I'm currently doing a second bachelor's degree, soÂ I've seen some things.) She's struck a fine balance, preparing students for harder chemistry without overwhelming them. She is a gentle soul who must be protected at all costs."
842,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,5 stars aren't enough for Dr. Sackett. You won't need the textbook because her lectures are so comprehensive and easy to understand. She gives printable lecture outlines that organize your notes. The tests are STRAIGHT out of the homework. I Her lab was also well-organized and straightforward. She handled the COVID-19 transition online with ease.
843,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,"Took this awesome Professor in the Fall 2019 semester. Very humble, caring, and enthusiastic about Chemistry. If you participate, she notices and is very considerate. Tries her best to engage the class. Used her lectures and practiced the optional HW questions to study for the Exams. Wouldve made an A if only I prepared for the first exam."
844,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM2325,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Sackett was very organized. Willing to help outside class time. Test were tough, but the homework and notes helped a lot."
845,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,OCHEM2,1.0,5.0,"She is one of the worst professors that I have ever met. Her exams are nothing like her homework. She makes things unnecessarily hard for a community college class. Even her labs are hard and require a lot of time. She is tough on grading, and will make sure you fail her class."
846,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,OCHEM2,1.0,5.0,I do not know who put these reviews for her. Her exams are HARD. She grades very tough and this does not feel like a community college class. She is not very understanding and makes this class harder than that of a four year institute. Do not recommend taking her. It will take away your peace of mind.
847,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Sackett has been the least understanding of all of my professors through the coronavirus pandemic. She did not post any completed notes online before this began, as some reviews have said. She has high expectations but changed the way we were doing online class several times and was frustrated when approached for clarification."
848,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,4.0,2.0,Overall I say she is a good professor. There is a textbook but you only need to use it if you don't show up to lecture or are unable to learn from lecture. Lecture can be a bit dry but then again it is a general chemistry class. Homework is optional but helpful. She also gives bonus points and an optional final to replace your lowest test grade.
849,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Sackett is a true gem of a professor. One of the nicest people I have ever met, and she truly wants her students to succeed and actually learn. There is no mandatory homework, but the homework is basically the types of problems on the test, so definitely do it. She is very accommodating and understanding. overall one of the best profs out there"
850,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,"I was so afraid to take chemistry and biology in one semester but Dr. Sackett really gives concise expectations. Class notes are outlined so it's very easy to be organized. The tests reflect homework almost exactly so if you go to class, do the homework, and study it you're golden. She is super accommodating and understanding, take her for lab also"
851,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM2325,1.0,5.0,Your grade is based of Exams purely. And she gives you soo much information that it's hard to study for the exam because there's just way too much to memorize. If you take her make sure you dont have a full schedule.
852,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM2323,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've ever had! Her lectures are well structured and she is very easy to approach with questions. She posts notes online so If you skip a class it's no worries. Attendance is not required and homework is optional, definitely use the homework as a review for the tests. She's always available for office hours."
853,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sackett goes above &amp; beyond to set you up for success, and gives every opportunity to learn &amp; pass, even if u struggle. Gives notes templates to be filled in during class (but u need to print). Super patient &amp; helpful, even for chem dummies like me. See her during office hours if u need help, won't regret. Can't imagine taking anyone else."
854,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,4.0,"absolutely amazing teacher - clear, organized, concise lectures - always gives time for questions. HMWK + attendance not graded, but definitely beneficial to getting a higher grade; test heavy but very similar to unit homework/reviews, so if you study those, you'll do fine. would love to have her again for any chemistry class!"
855,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sackett is AMAZING. Highly recommend to seek her out as your professor. Extremely thorough + always gives time for questions from students; Attendance is not mandatory yet DEFINITELY needed in order to pass the class - amazingly organized lectures, clear terminology, ""easy"" exams if you study the homework questions + spend the time studying"
856,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1301,5.0,1.0,"The best professor ever! prepares the students so well for the test, amazing lectures, makes sure that everyone understands the material and she's amazing at explaining things."
857,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1111,5.0,3.0,"She's an amazing professor and she'll make sure you understand the class. Only tests are part of your grade, but she makes sure you're ready for them. Attendance and HW is not necessary but is recommend as the test are based off the HW. She gives some extra credit opportunity. If you hate chemistry like i did before, you'll end up liking it after."
858,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1311,5.0,4.0,Dr. Sackett is amazing! Lecture notes are well organized and pre-written for you. Her lectures are structured and easy to follow. HW is optional and exams make up 100% of your grade. There are 5 exams with an optional comprehensive final to replace your lowest score. If you take her class you will absolutely learn the material.
859,2177123,Debra,Sackett,Austin Community College,Chemistry,CHEM1411,4.0,3.0,"I can honestly say I learned a lot in her class and she was very helpful and approachable when I went to her office hours. No need for the text book, she doesn't even require that you show up to class, but if you can do the homework you can ace the exam. She's straight forward and cool"
861,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,2.0,"super sweet and enthusiastic! sort of tough on papers, don't expect anything above a 90 usually. however, she gives very detailed corrections on your papers"
862,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,"I was nervous because I took the fast class and I do not like English, but she is a fantastic teacher. Short story reads and she is clear of exactly what she wants on the assignment and how she is grading. She gives feedback on your draft if you want before you turn in. I learned a lot from her. Do the work and you will pass. Papers are not long."
863,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,I took her honors class and I loved it! She is super cool and really wants you to succeed. Take her if you can!
864,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,5.0,"Professor Juel is a good professor. She expects you to contact her for help to get an A. She is doing a nice thing of protesting to remove the Departmental final. You share your thing with her on google docs, she sends you comments. There are no textbooks, instead readings on blackboard. I really recommend her."
865,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,COMP1302,5.0,3.0,"Seemed passionate about the literature we discussed, which for me was sort of infectious. Really encourages group discussions, both in class and online (some online discussions are graded, she's clear on which ones are). I would say she grades fairly, but can wait a bit long to get grades posted. Personally, i really enjoyed this class."
866,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,COMP1301,4.0,3.0,Double check that you aren't accidentally taking a hybrid class if you don't want one. She's super nice but grades somewhat harshly. Pay attention to exactly what she's looking for.
867,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,1.0,"Professor Juel is a real gem. I took her for ENGL-1301 and ENGL-1302. I would recommend her to anyone! I took her 1302 hybrid class and it was great. She grades things in a timely manner and gives good feedback on your essays. In the hybrid class we had a discussion board once a week, 1 quiz a week, and 4 essays. Just do your work and you'll be ok."
868,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,COMP1301,5.0,3.0,"She's entertaining. There are 4 papers. The last ""paper"" is more a worksheet about how well you can apply the material you learned in class. I really enjoyed her, however I took her hybrid class and it didn't work for me because it's harder to keep up with. Papers are straight forward, made an A on all 4. PARTICIPATION IS KEY. Slightly unorganized."
869,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,5.0,4.0,Professor Juel is obviously passionate about both Literature and teaching. Her class was very engaging and involved a lot of class participation. She grades papers fairly and her instructions are clear. She helped me come to love literature and writing as an art form. She often focused on the cultural significance of the literature we studied.
870,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,Professor Juel is a great professor she is a tough grader on papers but do what the instructions tell you and you will be able to pass with no problem. She is there for you in her office hours if you need her and provides great help. I would highly recommend her even if English isnt your favorite subject.
871,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,2.0,3.0,"Not my first choice, but good in a pinch, or you need another English class. She tries to make it fun to learn and connect to today's topics. Grades your papers in a weird manner, and often come in late too."
872,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,COMP1301,5.0,2.0,Professor Juel makes each class enjoyable. She gives out a few quizzes that are done on blackboard and you will have 4 major essays. She is very understanding and responds to emails very quickly.
873,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely adore Prof. Juel! She is kind, caring, and so far, both of the classes I've taken from her have been the best I've ever taken. She is very passionate about English and clearly loves to teach! She is super super helpful. She actually had memorized all of our names by week 3! Take as many classes as you can from her, she's a real gem :)"
874,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,COMP1302,3.0,3.0,"Professor Juel cares about her students learning how to structure an essay effectively, not just about them getting perfect grammar. She really wants class participation."
875,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,2.0,5.0,"Professor Juel was a kind professor but the class was boring. If I had to take the class again, I wouldnt take her."
876,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,4.0,"Super enthusiastic, even when the rest of the class wasn't. Not extremely tough grader, but still tough, you probably won't ever get over a 95 and that is only if your paper is nearly perfect. Gives good feedback, really takes the time to analyze each and every one of your papers. Good at responding to emails, and very helpful! Super nice &amp; funny."
877,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Juel is super funny and makes class interesting, she clearly lays out what you have to do on every paper and gets you very prepared for the departmental exam."
878,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,3.0,"she's so nice, she always reply to her email fast. but the only thing is that she takes forever to grade and she doesn't give us the paper's until she hand us the other paper. It's not hard to pass her class but you have to spend time doing the essays that she gives you. She doesn't gives any tests which is good. I really recommend taking her."
879,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,2.0,"Easy class. Show up, do your work, get easy A"
880,1156358,Heidi,Juel,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher! I took her this semester and she cares about her students. Take her if you get a chance because you will learn a lot. If you do your work then you should be fine.
882,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG2333,3.0,4.0,"Easily the worst class I've taken. The readings were boring and 150 pages+/week. Leaving a late review, because in times of COVID with online only learning this review can save someone. Her tests were so difficult and specific, but that was when we took it in testing centers. The ""sample"" questions were way easier than her actual tests. Avoid."
883,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG2322,5.0,4.0,Very accommodating with assignments so long as you communicate with her. She made final optional due to the stress of Covid. The work isn't hard if you make an effort to do the readings. Expect to read 50-150 pages per week. Time management is key here. I took this class while working and going to school full time and it was more than doable.
884,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,BRITLIT,3.0,5.0,"Didnt stand out in anyway to me. Very average class. Not hard to pass, but requires effort."
885,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG2333,3.0,5.0,"Didn't take other peoples advice. I repeat DO NOT TAKE unless you are English major, and maybe only taking 2 classes. This class will leave you with no time for your other classes(your other grades will suffer regardless of time management)Professor is nice, BUT not exaggerating get ready to read over 100 pages each week(very tiny long text pages)"
886,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG2333,1.0,5.0,"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! Her exams are RIDICULOUSLY difficult. and she only gives two, each for 30% of your grade. You'll be in the testing center for at least 4 hours, and she tells you that too. You have to read A LOT, and for the exam she makes you identify single passages from each text and write detailed responses about it. Trust me. DON'T DO IT"
887,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,LIT2301,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Morgan is amazing! Being an English major I am very picky on whose literature classes I take, but I will pick up any class Prof. Morgan teaches. If you show up, do the reading and participate by adding to the class conversation the class is a lot of fun. Prof is willing to work with you should something come up! 10/10 would highly recommend!"
888,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,5.0,5.0,Great Teacher. Weekly untimed (written and multiple choice) quizes and discussions which get harder. Expect to read roughly 30-50+ pages every week. Only 2 Tests (not timed) which are very hard. Tests cover about 14 stories Written Test answers come from bonus reading material which you must study to get right must recite characters and excerpts.
889,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,2.0,This Professor was one of my favorite of this semester no doubt. She is funny and very flexible when it comes to grading and time management so long as she sees you are giving the effort to actually try. The class was very fun to attend and also very inspiring as well. Great class and professor with an enjoyable semester.
890,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,COMP1302,5.0,3.0,Prof Morgan genuinely cares about her students success. This does not mean you wont have to work. Make sure to apply her feedback. She gives clear and comprehensive feedback on your paper and gives you the option of rewritting for a higher grade. Morgans course encourages students to enjoy writing; and the short stories are amazing!
891,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,3.0,"Very easy to follow lectures, if you do the readings you will never have a problem, is very approachable when it comes to help with any writing assignments"
892,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,COMP1302,5.0,3.0,I feel like reading is fun again. Great stories. Do the readings/homework so you have something to talk about in class. Fun and enlightening course!
893,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"I have had my fair share of English professors, all of them wonderful in their own right, Dr. Morgan being no different. She emphasizes analytical writing, more so than I had previously done, to make you really look at the text, but she keeps class fun and engaging with her quirkiness, sarcasm, and humorous tangents. I would highly recommend her."
894,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,COMP1302,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Kazel Morgan's teaching style is a great match for those who wish to improve their writing and enjoy analyzing great stories. She is an exceptional teacher whose caring attitude encourages students to do their best work. If you apply her constructive feedback on your essays, everything will have clicked for you by the end of the course."
895,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,AMERLIT2,4.0,2.0,"It's a lot of reading, but it's to be expected. Do not get behind. You have reading assignments due every single week and sometimes you have to read 2-3 short stories in a week. Discussion boards or/and quizzes are due every week. It's in the syllabus so if you follow along you'll be fine. Two exams which are hard. Know the stories &amp; characters."
896,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,AMERLIT1,5.0,2.0,"I took her British Literature class at ACC. If you go to class, participate, do your work and study, you will get a good grade. She was always available outside of class if I needed any help. I had a wonderful time in her class and everyone enjoyed her and the readings. We even had a couple of fun projects in her class that semester!"
897,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,"I enjoyed her class. We read Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye in this class and wrote argumentative essays using the book. I loved the class discussions. Dr. Morgan was always available to answer questions during office hours or after class. In the end, my appreciation for literature deepened. I became a better writer and taught college English."
898,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,COMP1302,5.0,1.0,I had a lot of fun in this class. She has very interesting ideas and ways to interpret the reading material.
899,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,1.0,Always willing to help during office hours. Thought-provoking lectures.
900,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,LIT2301,5.0,2.0,Amazing prof. Will make you fall in love with literature.
901,245390,Kazel,Morgan,Austin Community College,English,AMERLIT1,5.0,4.0,Dr. Morgans class was truly a great experience. She cares a great deal about us as students and wants to make sure everyone fully grasps the curriculum. I appreciated her attention to detail and the level of freedom she gives the class to speak up and have a real dialogue about whats being covered week to week.
903,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,2.0,"This class was pretty easy, tests are almost verbatim from the reviews. It was essentially a correspondence course, I did not interact with Professor Thomas until November. There's a big research paper at the end of the semester but no final. She was very helpful with the paper, but generally, I have no idea who she is. Good class, can recommend."
904,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"Although I highly recommend taking this class with GOVT2305 b/c the material overlaps, I DON'T suggest taking Dr. T's 5-week class with another 5-week class. If you read and do/study her study guides, u will likely ace the tests and get a B. But if u want an A, u have to do a 7-page research essay, which I didn't have time for w/ the other class..."
905,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301DIL,5.0,3.0,"I had her for a distance learning class, so I have never met her in person. I can say that she did a really good job being on top of answering emails and being clear on what the course required. Very much enjoyed taking her class, learned a lot while getting credit."
906,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,Took her online class and it was quite good. I am an ESL student and question on the exam were a bit tricky. But overall the syllabus was crystal on what to do in order to get a certain grade. There are 5 exams: first one is super easy and other fours are straight from the study guide. So make sure to prepare for study guide questions.
907,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301DIL,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Thomas's HIST 1301 and 1302 online. She was awesome - extremely organized, her grading policy is easy to understand, and she is VERY fast at responding to emails. If you have questions, she's always happy to assist. The textbooks she chose are engaging and interesting. There is a lot of reading but I really enjoyed it. Thanks Dr. Thomas!"
908,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,"Took this class online over a summer semester, professor has unclear grading criteria for the research paper, and extremely long study guides. Study guides are only helpful 50% of the time, so be ready to read the whole chapter and study A LOT. Only 5 grades total, all of them tests that had to be taken at an ACC testing center."
909,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,best prof ever
910,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Thomas is everything you could want from a professor! She is passionate about history, organized in her lectures, and all around a very kind person. I enjoyed her class very much and would definitely recommend her to anyone looking to take HIST 1301."
911,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"This was my second semester with Prof Thomas, and she is awesome. Print out the study guide she provides. Use it to go through the textbook and create a word doc with your answers. Use that to study from. All info is available at the beginning of the semester, so progress as quickly as you'd like. Responds promptly to emails. Highly organized."
912,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Thomas is a fantastic professor. I took her online courses for both 1301 and 1302 and she has been the best I've had thus far. Anytime you email her with a question she responds within the same day and for most of my emails, the same hour. She really respects that some students have things other than school in their lives. Highly recommend."
913,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,professor thomas is an amazing lecturer! she goes into detail with every historic event. Her class never bored me. She always came prepared with pp presentation that is easy to follow. If you read the book before class youll easily be able to get an A. She gives you test reviews that are optional to do. If you want an A theres a book report!
914,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,3.0,3.0,"good lectures. U do need the book to pass this course, always show up on time or she will put you on blast to stay after. The review is not that hard, just read &amp; use ur google resources. I would give myself atleast 4 days to study before the test. Only thing i didnt like is if she didnt cover the material she still wants you to teach it 2 urself"
915,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,One of my favorite teachers ever. Very respectful if you respect her rules and show up often and on time. Her lectures are entertaining and she clearly has a passion for what she teaches. I took both American History courses and found them easy to pass if you just do the weekly reading (it's not that much)
916,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"I took her class online so I don't know much about her personality or teaching, but her class was pretty straight forward. You essentially determine your grade, do the minimum get a C, do a book report to potentially make a B, and then a research paper to make an A."
917,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301DIL,3.0,4.0,"Had mixed feelings about Dr. Thomas, quizzes were worded hard and some of the study guide questions didn't correlate to the test. Paper for the A is one of the hardest papers I've had to write."
918,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,Her syllabus is very straightforward. Not an easy A but you can do it if you read all you chapters carefully since some questions can be tricky. The professor answers your emails very quickly.
919,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301DIL,5.0,3.0,"I HATE HISTORY have always been horrible at it. I received a B! her study guides are the best! I assure you will pass the 5 exams if you do them! I did the study guides and didn't study, but please make sure to read every page and chapter. I enjoyed re-learning over the US HISTORY wish I can take her for HIST 1302"
920,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302DIL,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Thomas is really nice. She is very responsive to emails. Just one thing needed to be aware that you need to read the book to answer all questions in her study guide and you should be fine. The map test is really helpful to build up your total point, so try to get 30 points on that test because it is super easy. She is not a tough grader."
921,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,4.0,4.0,Dr. Thomas has a straightforward online US History course. I took her for US History I and II. Read the chapters and do the study guide (which goes along with the textbook). Not much is provided other than the study guide. There is a mandatory research paper to get an A which I found difficult even though I'm a strong writer. I would recommend her.
922,642293,Teresa,Thomas,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,"Great professor! Very clear instructions. Online class was simple, read the book, take the tests, write a research paper. She provided prompt feedback and helped me revise the paper -- really cool considering she had several online classes. I'd totally take her again!"
924,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2323,5.0,1.0,"Professor Berni was great. Before the COVID-19 disruption, attendance wasn't necessarily mandatory but I believe once you missed 9 or so classes you would run into some problems. Lectures were good for help on what to focus your papers on. The grade was based on daily journal entries, two essays, one group project, and a take-home essay exam."
925,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,4.0,3.0,great and understanding! lots of reading and papers are expected for an engl course.
926,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2323,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Berni is one of the best English professors I've ever had. I took Brit. Lit. with her &amp; she is super passionate about what she teaches, so lectures are engaging &amp; insightful. Daily journals are easy &amp; she gives really good feedback on essays. She lets you extend essay deadlines if you need it and you let her know at least 24 hours before."
927,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,5.0,3.0,I took Professor Berni 16 week online course for American Literature. Her class was interesting and so were the readings for the class. She gave back great feedback when you would do your tests (essays).
928,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"She is the best teacher at ACC with no doubt!! I really enjoyed her lectures! She makes them interesting and fun! She has a super chill personality, and its a great instructor. The storys that she makes you read are really interesting, and she ir really good giving feedback. I just enroll in other of her classes!!"
929,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,2.0,"Berni is THE English teacher to take if this is your first college course! She is very caring, chill, and never made us feel inferior to her. I took her 5-week summer course and even though it was a paper every week and some readings, she always gave our rough drafts feedback before we have to turn them in, I got a 100 in the class. Definitely rec!"
930,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,5.0,4.0,"Prof Berni's class is challenging but rewarding. She is a tough grader, but gives good feedback and wants her students to succeed. Put the effort in and you will do well; slack off and you won't make it. She offers some extra credit, but it is limited so you have to do the work. Weekly discussion board posts, three papers, and a group project."
931,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,5.0,4.0,"This is an American Literature class. Be prepared to read, but the works she assigns are interesting a worth the read. I love how she gave background information when in regards to the time period of which we were reading. Just take her. Trust me! She's great!"
932,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"The best professor ACC! Strongly recommend if your not good at writing, she is more then willing to help with your paper in and out of class. 14 journals that reflect the short stories, put in the effort they count towards your final grade! Very easy grader, strongly recommend!"
933,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,4.0,1.0,"I guess it is supposed to be expected to have a lot of papers in an English class, but I found myself doing one every other night. It might be that I took the accelerated summer course, but it was heavy. She is an easy grader, but picky about grammar (she docks that like crazy). Also, ignore word limits. You're going to go past them."
934,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2323,5.0,3.0,"I had Dr. Berni for 2 Online classes. She is the best teacher at ACC!!--organized, returns emails sometimes within minutes, 3 papers that she is willing to help with (1 is an Exam), no testing center exams, super smart, caring, gives extra credit, and great books to read. You have to work but she makes it fun and interesting!! Take her if you can!!"
935,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,"Literally an angel! Gives good feed back and wants students to succeed. Easy to talk to about papers and what needs to be done, STRONGLY RECOMMENDED :)"
936,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,5.0,2.0,Professor Berni was amazing! I loved her class so much. She chose readings that were interesting. 3 papers and a class presentation. A very generous grader and lets you turn in essays early to get feedback. Also she gives extra credit!
937,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,5.0,"Professor Berni was an awesome professor. I took her 6 week accelerated class this Summer and I couldn't have had a better experience. There is a ton of work, but if you are proactive and manage your time wisely you will get a fair grade. She genuinely cares about her students success, and I plan on taking her Lit class in the future."
938,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,1.0,She gave a lot of extra credit opportunities and cares
939,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,COMP1301,5.0,2.0,"Very kind and understanding. Always willing to answer our questions. 5 essays and 7 read and responses. A lots of works but worth it. Easy A if you show your efforts. I had two of my major essay assignments late for 2  weeks, still got an A, because I really showed my efforts, and she noticed and understood my hard work."
940,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,COMP1301,5.0,2.0,"There are 10 quizzes, 67 read-and-responses, 5 essays and 1 final exam essay. Quizzes are very easy. Read-and-response and essays will be easy if you show your efforts. She is very kind and understanding, and she is not a tough grader at all. She is always willing to talk and response to students' questions. A lots of works but definitely worth it"
941,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,1.0,"She's a really good teacher. Like really good. She's not a tough grader at all, and very understanding."
942,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,5.0,2.0,"She is always available during office hours and willing to help. The first reading topics were about religious stuff which was difficult for me; but it got better when the topics were associated with slavery. The readings are long, and there were journal topics everyday in class. She was a very fair grader and is willing to go over previous essays."
943,41298,Chris,Berni,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,4.0,I loved Ms Berni. She was really quick to answer email and gives lot of opportunity to make extra points. Hard class but chance to redo an essay to improve your grades which in my case was REALLY helpful. She really wants all the students to pass her class with a good grade. Would definitely take her again if needed.
945,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1414,4.0,4.0,"The class isn't considered an easy A because you do have to put in the time to understand it like every math class. The syllabus was 3 tests, 100 points each, homework is worth 100, and final is worth 200 points, which I really didn't thank was fair. Professor is clear when teaching and happy to help. Tip: do all the homework to get an A!"
946,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,"Mr. B helps his students understand concepts on a basic level. If you show up and do your homework, youll pass. He really makes sure his students fully grasp the learning objectives and continues to drill that down until it becomes second nature. Ive taken math 1314 twice before and Mr. B is the absolute best. Not boring and super funny!"
947,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH0390,5.0,2.0,Take him he really is such a good professor!
948,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,I do not have a strong math back him and Mrs. Himes class was a life saver. They broke things down to where you could fully understand and your notes matched up with homework. They work the problems out step by step and show you how to get from point A to point B. I would recommend for any student especially ones who struggle with math!!
949,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH0414,5.0,4.0,Great Professor. He is very passionate about his lectures. Always available.
950,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0414,5.0,5.0,"Math has ALWAYS been really difficult for me. Took his and Mrs. Izzards combined developmental/College Algebra class. It was 5 days a week, which was pretty draining. However, after many attempts, I FINALLY GOT my College Algebra credit with their help. They are excellent teachers &amp; care about their students. Group studying is IMPORTANT!"
951,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0390,5.0,3.0,"Hes a great teacher makes math actually make sense for once in my life. Tells antidotes to help the class remember, and is one of the best teachers Ive ever had."
952,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,4.0,His lectures are informative but also very easy to grasp so you understand the material. His class is lecture based but he makes it fun.
953,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0414,3.0,3.0,He is always available. Teaches with enthusiasm and knows his stuff. He will through in math history and stories to make things interesting. I hate math and have a hard time learning it. This is my second class with him and have learned a lot. He is a great teacher.
954,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"by far one of my favorite teachers and I absolutely hate math he encouraged me to ask questions and now I ask multiple questions each time when I typically am the student to sit in silence and regret it later, he is hilarious and doesn't make you dread coming to class like any other math class I would recommend him to anyone."
955,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher! Really funny, does talk about himself a little. Typical white male stuff."
956,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,5.0,"Enjoyed his class, he made math fun and entertaining even when it was other wise hard. Recommend taking this professor because he does what he can even when it's a hard class. He has more passion for math and he's excited to the teach not just the basics but all the math theory. Encourages better performance and expects hard work even on weekends."
957,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,5.0,"He is truly passionate about students learning the proper way of math. Uses Mathlab and textbook homework, its a lot of work but it helps. Lectures were always fun but his test were hard. He does not give out test reviews."
958,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,3.0,5.0,"He can be very clear on teaching. Unfortunately, there were times when he would get off-topic, like hed start talking about his life, and cracking jokes in class. And it would go on for like 10-15 mins of class time. Also, he typically arrived 5-8 mins late to class everyday. Lastly, he could possibly be rude too."
959,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Lots of HW but 100% do-able. 4 exams w a final. All exams have test corrections. Class was super easy. DO EVERY HW asgmt. for 4 bonus pts on final! Show up everyday or you'll miss a sect. For each sect, there's 2 assignments-1 online &amp; 1bookwork. EX: 1.2: 1.2 online &amp;1.2 bookwork. Covers sect 1.2-6.6 YOU NEED A TEXT BOOK,BUY ONLINE PEARSON VERSION!"
960,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD1301,5.0,3.0,By far the best math teacher at ACC I've taken many math courses in the past and have always gotten a low c but I made a high b in this course! I struggle with math but he made sure to give examples and explain why. He's super funny and very loud so be ready! There is a lot of homework but practice never killed anyone!
961,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0390,5.0,4.0,"Mr Bickham is a funny guy. He is a good teacher and wants you to learn math, not memorize a trick to solve problems. Class is light and fun and he will take time to help you if you need it."
962,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,3.0,"Yes he's funny, but his tests are HARD. Lots of homework but its good review."
963,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,4.0,"I took Calc I during summer so it was fast paced. He is well organized, fun guy, has a great way of breaking the ice, friendly. Does not have a singling out manner. Goes over the material well, as usual with all math, if you do not do HW you will not pass. Very fair."
964,672545,Jonathan,Bickham,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0370,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! Mr. Bickham has really good lectures, and funny ones too. He does assign a lot of homework, which he grades by completion, but he gives you a week to turn it in. He will give you partial credit on tests and there is almost always an extra credit section. He is really good at helping students understand problems and he doesn't make you feel dumb for not understanding the first time. If you do your homework, go to class, and put in all your effort, you can easily pass the class."
966,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,2.0,4.0,"She has really bad hand writing and she grades for accuracy, yet struggles with spelling herself. I would not take her again for there is a quiz every time you go to class."
967,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,3.0,"Just do the work and you will pass. Class felt like it's been recorded and professor just pushed play.  Makes it very clear that she hold you to a very high standers when it comes to grammar, clarity, and penalizing you for it. While at the same time finding several mistakes on her end. Does not give test back so that you learn from them."
968,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,5.0,3.0,"The class seems difficult but if you just sit down to work through it, you won't have an issue. It seems like info over load the first week but after that its pretty straightforward what the assignments are and when they are due. There were 4 tests and great feedback in the 8 week online section. Teaches you how to think objectively and clearly."
969,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,4.0,This class was great. I learned so much and was always very excited for class but also new that class time would be spent working thoroughly! A lot of outlines and assignments but they all prepare you for the test. Which in my opinion are not hard. Take this professor if you want to learn and earn your grade.
970,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,1.0,5.0,"This is the only class  I have taken at ACC were I spent the whole semester lost. This class is beyond hard, I tired to stick with it and killed myself and still didn't pass. This teacher is beyond a bad term for a teacher, I asked for help many times asked questions I was ignored every single time. She is not nice and treats her students crap."
971,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,1.0,3.0,This was absolutely the worst class I took at ACC. Such a pompous teacher and you will not learn anything. Complete waste of time. You will spend a lot of time matching terms but you won't remember any for use later on because they are unimportant. This is not a class to take if you want to learn. Busy work does not equal education.
972,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306ETHIC,2.0,5.0,"difficult to understand, a lot of attitude during the semester. she is too passionate about philosophy and expects u to learn with the same passion. the most unapproachable teacher ever, make sure u have GOOD AND HEAVY reasons to contact her,  or she will ignore u.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND U TO TAKE THIS CLASS OR BETTER SAID DO NOT TAKE SUSAN ALVARADO'S"
973,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,"I have never met such an unapproachable and unprofessional individual. She makes things more complicated than it should be. Feels like she is trying to compensate for her lack of knowledge. She expects ""college writing"" when she cant even spell things right or follow good sentence structure. Syllabus: tons of attitude. I should have known better."
974,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,4.0,"The way she runs her class is a bit disorganized. Her test reviews are nice, but sometimes she doesn't update them according to the next exam. She is really picky on how you contact her and what you do for assignments. She also takes a while to get back to you on grades and emails. The class is doable, but not without frustration at times."
975,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,3.5,3.0,"After having a rough start with this professor, we had a pretty good report after I spoke to her. Beware, she would rather you reach out to peers if you are missing assignments. She doesn't mince words.  The course is very interactive for an online class.  An ""A"" is impossible unless you are exceptional and she lets you know that! Syllabus is clear"
976,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,1.0,3.0,"Her instruction from syllabus to reviews is unnecessarily convoluted. She told us in the middle of the final that she had not decided on grading criteria. She will set you up for failure and blame you for it. She is the most inaccessible teacher I have ever taken. Do not bother emailing her, she will only insult you for asking a question."
977,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.5,4.0,She seems very unorganized. She tells you to study one thing for a test and then ends up asking something totally different on the test. Would NOT recommend her.
978,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,"DR.A is not the nicest person. She almost never responds to emails, she is rude.  Her assignments are not very clear. Her test are super hard Miss class you won't pass I would of honestly dropped her class if it wasn't for her amazing Assistant CHARLYNNE !! She was honestly the reason I passed that class. She helped a lot!!!"
979,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,1.0,5.0,"An educator should never ever discourage students from asking questions , but she does. She starts off most assignments and reviews with don't ask me a question unless.  Horrible people skills, disrespectful and self-absorbed. ACC you can do better- find someone to teach that reflects the integrity of your institution. Sorry to those stuck with her"
980,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.5,4.0,"There is ALOT of work BUT its very doable. The bundles she assigned had a lot of ""give me"" points while there were other times, I HAD NO CLUE how to answer some of the questions. Tests were mostly 60% REVIEW from PRIOR exams and 40% new content. Stay on top of the old info those are easy points on exams and ""use your college-level writing skills :)"
981,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,5.0,5.0,"This class is very tough, but Dr. A will help you stay on track.  The book is horrible but her lecture notes are easy to follow.  "
982,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,1.5,4.0,"Honestly, was not my favorite class. I couldn't keep up with how unorganized she was. There wasn't much learning as much as memorizing her notes precisely in order to get a decent grade. And when I say precisely I mean down to the last word. She's funny and class isn't a complete bore, but I defiantly would not take her again."
983,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor, has her classes set up to help people, really tries to help and understand. If you don't talk to her and let her know you have issues she can't help you. Helped me out a lot when I was dealing with my father being in and out of the hospital. Would take again if I needed more Philosophy classes."
984,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL-2306,2.5,4.0,"This class is ONL. Info not available until reg. was closed. On the syllabus I find that you can only take her tests FRI, SAT, or SUN. I take online classes because I work 55+ hours a week with no control over my schedule.  I work 14 hours a day Thurs-Sun, but I can't drop the class or else I lose my financial aid.  No choice but to fail. Beware"
985,948237,Susan,Fiehrer,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,3.0,"Took her two semesters ago &amp; I loved her class. So much class discussion, she really wants to hear opinions/strong-clear arguments from the class. Not an easy A but if you put in a little effort &amp; do the extra credit opportunities (many) not hard to get an A. My class didn't even write any papers. Study your notes &amp; study guide &amp; you'll do fine"
987,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,1.0,5.0,"Unless you are a lit major, I highly recommend to stay away from his class. His tests are so unnecesarily difficult, and the essay prompts are ridiculously specific. I felt as if I had wrote the best essay of my life, and still failed. He takes MONTHS to grade essays. Steer clear of Prof Ruane if you care abt your gpa."
988,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2328,5.0,3.0,"Interesting lectures: very into the texts but relates the ideas in what we read to real life. Has made me like to read REAL literature, not just pop fiction like I used to. Very helpful during office hours. The work was the normal stuff, 2 papers, 2 essays. I'm going to take his other survey course. Great professor."
989,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,5.0,3.0,"Good lectures, and not a lot of work: just 2 essays and 2 exams. A friend said that the keys were showing up and taking notes, and she was right. Try office hours; I nailed down most of the points for my papers in those brief conversations. Going to take the other survey course."
990,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"I don't agree with any of these bad reviews. He is willing to work with you if you ASK for help. He wants to help students become better college level writers and gives lots of good feedback. His classes are engaging and he is very knowledgable and open-minded. He is very caring, and is always at office hours. I recommend taking his class!"
991,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,Professor Ruane is by far one of my favorite teachers at ACC. If you want to get an easy A then do NOT take this class. Professor Ruane cares a lot about literature and he wants you to care a lot about it too. You only write a few papers in class but will spend a lot of time on revisions. This is a great class and very satisfying to pass!
992,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"I dropped the class after I received my first paper and completely flunked. All of his feedback was based upon subjective ideas and was too critical, it being the first assignment. One of my friends just got his checklist back after a month, with no paper. By the time I dropped the class, only half of the students were left. Dont take this class."
993,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,don't take his class if you wanna pass
994,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,COMP1301,2.0,5.0,Does not care about his students at all. And literally cant miss one class
995,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,If you care about your grade don't bother taking this class. He is constantly changing his mind about what he wants in an essay. He is looking for an excuse to give you anything but an A. He is available in office hours but don't count on the advice he gives you because when it comes to grading he doesn't take it in consideration.
996,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,4.0,"After nine hours of non-stop meticulously writing and revising my first essay and receiving an essay's worth of notes and 75, I felt deeply anxious. But at the end of all of my papers, Ruane always mention that if I had any questions about his grading and notes, that I could come to office hours. In doing so, I received excellent instruction."
997,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,Has all of the terrible traits of a typical english teacher. Expects you to write according to his own subjective interpretation of the fiction rather than letting you use literary analysis to write your own. Is a ridiculously hard grader on top of it all who will repeatedly fail you for not perfectly conforming to his standards. Avoid for your gpa
998,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,2.0,5.0,"Professor Ruane was a nice person and all. However, his lectures were extremely boring which makes the class not fun. Not only that but the essays that we were given to write were extremely difficult. Comments a lot on the essays given feedback. Really hard to earn a good grade in the class, you really need to work for it."
999,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,4.0,3.0,"American Lit I was a positive experience. Lots of reading, but keeping up and taking notes made the 2 exams and 2 papers pretty easy. Everything for exams and papers was covered in class. Good lectures and the exam review sessions were great."
1000,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,3.0,4.0,"Professor Ruane is a very nice person but is the. toughest. grader. Ive ever had, which makes class stressful and not fun. Expects nothing but perfection from everyone, despite that this is a core class that were required to take; treats us like were grad students pursuing an Masters in English"
1001,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENGL2327,4.0,3.0,"Good class. Lots of reading, as you might expect. Lectures focus on key ideas-- take notes. Two papers and two exams. Helpful review sessions. Not a hard class."
1002,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,3.0,I never cared about writing in HS but in this class I found out that I can write much better than I thought. The professors explanations of non-obvious things in the stories were interesting. I enjoy reading fiction and writing in general more now.
1003,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"You will rewrite your paper &amp; he might not even read the revision before you have to write it again. I struggled on the 2nd paper so I spent a lot of time on my revision &amp; even took it to a tutor on campus with a literary degree. The tutor said it had a good thesis &amp; was well supported by textual evidence. Roy read half the intro &amp; said ""rewrite""."
1004,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,4.0,5.0,"If writing/english is not your strong suit don't take this professor. He grades with very high standards, very difficult to get an A, even with multiple revisions on each paper and feedback. He looks for specific answers and reactions. However, very nice guy, his lectures were easy to follow along with and he was happy to help you with problems."
1005,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENG1302,3.0,5.0,"Do not choose him unless you are majoring in English. By the end of the semester, only 5 students were left. However, his lectures are interesting. You will learn a lot. He is very experienced. Make sure to show up on time, else you will fail the quiz. QUIZZES EVERYDAY! VERY Tough grader! Protip: record his lectures, go for help in office hours."
1006,1196491,Roy,Ruane,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1302,1.0,4.0,"Unless you are Majoring in English do not take this class. From day 1 we received an 11 page syllabus and given a quiz. Expect a quiz almost every class. You can not be late or it will count against you. Take specific notes on everything that he says. I failed the class despite attending every session, taking notes, and going to the learning lab."
1008,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1301,5.0,2.0,Super easy A. Great professor.
1009,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1302,5.0,2.0,"Professor Jonsson is great at what he does. He keeps his class on track by giving us handouts and reviewing them with us. His grading criteria is clear and he is easy to work with. I took this class back in fall 2019 and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't stressful at all, you just need to be responsible with the work he gives you (which is not much)."
1010,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1301,5.0,1.0,"Great professor. Study guide is test. You still have to read, but you will learn alot and have chances for extra credit. Do yourself a favor and TAKE THIS CLASS!!"
1011,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1301,4.0,4.0,"Took his class online and loved it. Clear cut grading. If you study, you can easily get an A. Offers very generous extra credit. The exact tests are posted for you to study. The final is not though and you have to study all the chapter questions. Was great about putting in grades. If you do the work, you will succeed. Read the syllabus."
1012,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1303,5.0,1.0,"I finished this class in two weeks with a 100 final grade. So so so easy, take his class ONLINE!! The reviews are identical to tests and the final is straight from review questions."
1013,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1303,5.0,2.0,This was an easy A. You have four test and a final. The review is just like the test. The final is a little tricky but HEY I studied before the final and passed. TAKE HIS ONLINE CLASS! EASY EASY EASY
1014,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1302,5.0,1.0,"easiest class you could ever take. the guy is so nice. seriously the hardest part about this class is showing up. if you do that you get an a+. tests are so easy, he gives you the questions before. he also offers a total of 10 extra credit points on your final overall grade. i truly would be concerned if you got anything below an A in this class."
1015,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1301,1.0,4.0,"Read the handouts, ALL OF IT, or fail."
1016,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1303,1.0,3.0,Took his online class and towards the end was terrible. He prepares you for 4 exams with reviews. But on the final no review at all. Never gives feedback and just stays absent through out the semester. I highly recommend you always having to reach out for him if you are ever concern with anything. Don't expect him to be active.
1017,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1303,5.0,1.0,"There are 5 test total. 4 that are 50 questions word for word to the review and the final that is from the mastering geography quizzes which is 250 questions to study. That Is all! there are optional extra credit trips. I finished the class with a 100, easily. If you study the review you will make a 100, simple. Take this for.a GPA booster."
1018,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1301,5.0,1.0,"This is the easiest class I have ever taken. Just study the questions for the 4 exams until you have them memorized and go to the testing center. The final is a bit daunting, but you just run through the practice in each chapter, once, to get the right answers, and study them just like you did for the other exams. I needed a class like this."
1019,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1302,2.0,3.0,"What a strange class! It's just multiple choice, auto-graded tests due at the end of the semester. That's it! And all but one of those tests is handed to you on his website so you just look up the answers and regurgitate them. Prof does nothing. Vague responses to emails. Extra credit requires attendance at distant locales on Saturday mornings."
1020,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1301,4.0,3.0,"Besides the final being a bit weird, the rest of the class is super easy. No papers, just lecture and lots of hand outs to read! No book, and extra credit trips if you want it. Would take again if he popped up in the next geog class I need."
1021,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1302,5.0,1.0,ridiculously easy class. took the online class and if you really tried it could be done in a few days. study guides exactly like the test and the final is 50 questions but you need to study 280
1022,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1301,4.0,2.0,"The whole class is 4 tests and a final, all on your own time. I procrastinated and did all 5 tests in the last 3 weeks of the semester, and its doable. The 4 exams are question for question so its a memorization game. The final, however is the reviews from a combination of MasteringGeology stuff and textbook reviews NOT THE OTHER REVIEWS COMBINED"
1023,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1301,4.0,3.0,Pretty straight forward. Easy class.
1024,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1301,4.0,2.0,"I did the online class. It was pretty easy, considering he posts the actual test questions for the first 4 tests for you to study. The comprehensive final is tough, so make sure you give yourself enough time to study the 250 question study guide. He offers field trip extra credit, which is worth it! I got an extra 15 points on my overall average."
1025,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1303,4.0,1.0,Easiest class ever. The study guides are literally the exact same questions/answers as what's on the tests. 4 tests and 1 final where you just study all the past guides (200 questions) and answer 50 questions. Sometimes the study guides were old and didn't match the textbook info. Had to google some. He also offers extra credit if you need it.
1026,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEOG1301,3.0,3.0,Took his 1301 Geography online class. STUDY the Final it is 40% of your grade and 200 questions to review. Do not waste money on any books or online quizzes just google the exam questions he posts and you can find info to help complete his reviews. The other 4 tests are exactly like the reviews he posts. Do the field trips if you can they are easy
1027,1685168,Don,Jonsson,Austin Community College,Geography,GEO1301,5.0,2.0,"This class was really interesting. It wasnt necessary to go to class everyday, but he was very knowledgeable about the stuff he was teaching. He was very open to learning new things as well. He gives you extra credit opportunities, and takes you to some really nice locations. Overall I enjoyed this class. He gives out a lot of papers to read."
1029,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2404,1.0,5.0,"I took him for A&amp;P 1, 2, and Micro. He is a lazy professor. Uploads old lectures, sends youtube video's for labs. If you can't self teach do not take him. He is extremely rude and combative when asked questions or challenged. He doesn't give lecture exams but the practical exams are a mess. Not Tech savvy at and will go off on random tangents."
1030,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2402,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this teacher. 10 minutes to take a 10 question quiz. 42 mins to take a 42 question practical. Test or quiz material is not over pictures or material actually that he actually covers. He says, make sure you know this and then the quizzes and practicals are different. Again do not take. The worst science teacher at ACC by far."
1031,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,2.0,5.0,"He didn't even teach the class I was in, only uploaded old recorded lectures. He said we didn't need to use the textbook but I choose to because the textbook was way more useful rather than his ""lectures."" He is rude when asking questions, doesn't even really answer the question. The recordings don't really go over the lecture objectives."
1032,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,3.0,"Due to COVID, I had to take this course online. While I would have loved to be in the lab in person, Mouton provided plenty of videos and links to help fully understand the information. On top of his passion for microbiology, he also has a great sense of humor. I would definitely take any of his classes!"
1033,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,"The professor is kind and cares for his students and will give all the information you need to be successful in his class. He shows you all the extra material that is available to you. you are encouraged to study because the quizzes and practicals are timed. in order to pass this class, you need to study to pass the graded assignments. Best Teacher"
1034,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,4.0,"He is not what he says he is. Very rude when you ask questions, doesn't want to explain. You either get it from his lecture or learn on your own. He talks about extra credit but he never offered it not once. He takes points away for every grammar mistake or misspells you do on a quiz. If you late or skip class 2 times you fail automatically."
1035,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,ANATOMY,1.0,3.0,"He is a Microbiology major. Dont take him for A&amp;P. He was rude when answering questions, often never actually answered any question, he just dances around explanations. He was late to class 2x (45mins late). Tough grader with little guidance on what he is expectations. I would not take him again. I felt cheated out of a valuable learning experience"
1036,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL1406,4.0,4.0,"He is a great teacher, he manages to dumb down hard science and bio concepts. The lecture part of this hybrid course can be done just by filling his weekly study guide. There are few grades for the course, so it makes it pretty hard to get a good grade, only 2 lab and 2 lecture tests."
1037,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2404,5.0,4.0,"I took professor Mouton for Microbiology for the Health Sciences this summer. It was an 11 week course so I did expect a lot of material covered each lecture. The material is tough but Mouton definitely helps with everything and answers questions. There are quizzes each week, he gives bonus questions. Make sure to study and you will be good!"
1038,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,Make sure you are ready to learn and review material before class. Take great notes! Gives extra credit on quizzes and bonus points on lab practicals. Always available to explain material and genuinely cares about students learning. One of my favorite Science professors! Would totally take A&amp;P II with him if he was teaching.
1039,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,Really helpful. Isn't intimidating so you feel free to ask questions. He provides bonus questions on his quizzes. Fast-paced but he made it work and was available whenever you needed him.
1040,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,Really helpful. Isn't intimidating so you feel free to ask questions. He provides bonus questions on his quizzes. I took it in the summer so it was a fast-paced class so there were quizzes every Thursday. Pretty great guy.
1041,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2304,5.0,4.0,Professor Mouton really cares about you understanding the material to be successful in the class. He cares about the students passing the course and is available to help if you have any questions. Do not miss lecture!! And take great notes!
1042,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2404,4.0,5.0,"I dropped the class after 3 classes, because I felt like I didn't have enough science background, I have a 4.0 and completed A&amp;P 1 the prior semester! But was very lost in Moutons class, his lectures are fun and interesting, but I think more prerequisites should be required."
1043,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2404,5.0,4.0,"Extremely knowledgeable professor. You will know exactly what to do to succeed in his class from week 1. Your hard work will be reciprocated by him. His class will not be that easy A but if you take any of his classes you will know, understand and be able to utilize the knowledge of the course. To actually learn he is a fantasic professor."
1044,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor! Takes time to make sure you understand material. Took only for Lab portion of Micro, always available throughout class to help with experiments and unknowns. READ before lab or you will be lost the entire time and will be stressed out! Gives review before lab practicals."
1045,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2404,5.0,3.0,"Micro is a hard subject but Mouton does a great job teaching it! Study the PowerPoints and pay attention to the extra stuff he says in class, it will either be on the test or will help you understand. Hes caring and will help you if youre struggling! 10/10 recommend!"
1046,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, although it is a lot of information, he tells you the material is straight form the power points, only 3 lecture exams, 3 lab exams ( no comprehensive final), quiz almost every wednesday (short and easy, if you study). Drops your lowest quiz grade! Flexible, willing to help you learn one-on-one, makes jokes to keep the class fun!"
1047,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2404,2.0,4.0,"By all means he wasn't a bad teacher, in fact I think he was a good person, issue was mostly that a few grades were mostly taken, if you are no good with fill in the blank quizzes like me, you will be wrecked. There isn't too much that could be done if you fail a quiz. Other than that the material is heavy, don't get behind!"
1048,1443017,Robert,Mouton,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"Professor Mouton was a great and caring professor! The class is only as difficult as you make it. You are given everything you need to be successful in this class. You will be graded on homework, quizzes, unknowns and exams. He provides drops for quizzes and homework. Everything you need comes from the power points and lecture, go to class!"
1050,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"Goines was definitely my favorite professor this past year. His lectures were incredible and he was super knowledgeable. However, the tests are somewhat difficult and you really have to work hard for them. They make up most if not all the course grade, so studying for hours is a must. It's worth it though to experience the man the myth the legend."
1051,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,2.0,Lectures/Attendance is CRUCIAL. If you don't go to class you're going to miss a BIG chunk of your test. Literally missing one class will make you miss 1/4 of the info. This being said his lectures are like a story and are easy to follow/ take notes. The first test is rough which kinda downed by grade but after you can def pull As.
1052,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"LOVED this professor. If I could, I would take this class again. It was no blowoff, but I enjoyed every second in class. He is an amazing lecturer. Tells things like a story to where the information sticks better, and he is very funny/light-hearted. I am now taking another history class, but I miss Goines so much and wish it was him teaching it."
1053,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,Professor Goines' tests were nearly impossible to get an A on. He has a short answer section that he never clarified how long or detailed the answers had to be. You must read the textbook to pass the tests even though his lectures are lengthy and packed with information. You have to know a lot of material so make sure you read.
1054,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"Very passionate about subject. Only grades are 4 tests and 1 easy book review. Get ready to write a ton because lectures are only aided by pictures on a slideshow and you need to know all of the info covered for the tests' short answer questions. Good professor, just a lot to know in detail (no dates to memorize tho)"
1055,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,Professor Goines is one of the most amazing professors Ive ever had. Ive hated history all of my life and I looked forward to going to his class everyday. His lectures are entertaining and keep you engaged. There are only 5 grades but the tests are straight from the lecture so if you take good notes and study well for the tests youll do well
1056,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,I just love Dr. Goines. His lectures are long but he is funny and really interesting. This was my favorite history class I have ever taken.
1057,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"This class was hard on its own. You have no options for extra credit. Tests are nothing like the study guide. No help at all. Although he responds to emails, the are so vague and confusing."
1058,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,5.0,"When I heard the whole class was just lectures I was super worried, but he is so good at making lectures super interesting! Definitely have to study hard for his tests and show up to class in order to get a good grade. Most interesting history class I've ever taken!"
1059,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"The whole entire course was five tests that weren't very much like the study guide, and anytime he was emailed he gave a vague response that didn't answer what you asked. Extremely unclear in his syllabus, and you have to study for those tests or you will fail."
1060,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,His syllabus might seem strict but he is a very good guy and is willing to work with you. He responded very quickly to my emails and helped me alot
1061,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,"Was recommended to me by a friend who must not have taken his online class. Ridiculously hard, txtbk doesn't help, &amp; study guides are long &amp; unhelpful. Only grades are 5 tests &amp; a paper &amp; the only way to get A or B is to write the paper, but can only do so w certain test average. Do NOT recommend online; even for strong students. 1st C in college."
1062,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,My words of advice: Don't take his online class.
1063,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,"Nice guy, good communication, but unless ur a history guru, DON'T TAKE ONLINE!!! The tests are crazy hard and the textbook is pretty much worthless because the answers in the book aren't all the same/in depth enough as on his tests. Hardest class I've taken in college because the amount of reading &amp; researching is crazy. BE ready to STUDY &amp; PRAY!"
1064,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"All around great professor, very passionate about what he teaches and wants students to succeed. Lectures like hes telling a story rather than lecturing, which makes it easy to pay attention and take notes. Tons of material is covered, but its interesting and isnt hard to keep up if you attend class. Grade is based on 4 tests and a book review."
1065,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,"This professor is SUPER HARD for an online class. You need to know every aspect of each of the chapters to do well on the tests. Also, to get an A in the class you have to write an eight-page research paper but you have to qualify for it. To do that you can't make lower than an 80 on each test otherwise you can't qualify for the research paper."
1066,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"He is my favorite ACC prof. Lectures are long but amazing. I'm surprised that people think this class is hard. Yes you have to go to class, but he is so interesting you will want to go. Just take good notes and let him know if you have a question. Tests are straight forward and mostly come from lectures. I made an A and just skimmed the book."
1067,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"PLEASE READ! My guy Patrick is a super cool dude. Im not too good at history in the first place but this class is DUMB hard and he teaches it as if we're all history majors. You HAVE to go to class, read the book and pray you know the right material. ALSO what doesn't help is the only grades in the class is the 4 HARD tests&amp; vague book report."
1068,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,Taking this online and the only thing you have access to is the textbook and the test review questions. The only thing you are graded on is your 5 exams so if you want to make the grade in this class you have to make sure you pass the exams well. No power points or notes available so this class isn't for me. Its hard to just learn from a textbook.
1069,237391,Laurence,Goines,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"the best history professor ever. I HATE history, but he made it interesting. Every class is a long lecture, but he tells it in story format. He is hilarious and nice... office hours help! I managed to write down every single word he said because he repeats absolutely everything. Tests are long, but verbatim his lectures. dont read the textbook"
1071,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,4.0,"Hard class, but she sets you up for success. Gives hints to possible test questions and lets you know specific things that will be on the exams. Homework and a quiz due every week, but those are easy points. Explains material very well and gives extra credit. You have to put in the work for an A."
1072,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2421,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT take this class if you have anything else going on. (Other classes, kids, allergies, a fondness for ever standing up again). I am getting my first B of my life thanks to this class. She is great at teaching and clearly very fond of her subject, but the workload is completely unattainable if you are taking any other classes."
1073,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE SUZY DURING HER ONLINE SESSIONS! She expects so so much homework, quizzes every night, lectures are hours long! I guess she doesnt get that we are in a pandemic and the learning circumstances are a little bit different. You will also have to do a 50 slide PowerPoint with little notice of what she expects on it. Prepare to cry &amp; STRESS!"
1074,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2420,1.0,4.0,"My experience with Mathis was like the worlds longest joke with no punchline. Do not take this class if you have children, a relationship, a job, any other class, laundry, or any responsibilities. School is her job, hobby, and life, and she expects it to be yours, too. Her way is the only way to learn. Lectures literally hours over time limit. Run."
1075,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,3.0,Y'ALL. Take Suzy. She almost made me change my major to micro! So passionate. So caring. As long as you put in the studying wrk outside of class (making flashcards w/pics)- easy A. She made the labs super interesting and fun. Very understanding and works with you if she sees you're making efforts! I'll forever love micro because of her!
1076,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"Suzy is a fantastic professor. She is knowledgeable about the subject matter at hand. She really loves science as a whole. If you're looking for an easy A, look elsewhere. I took her for Microbiology, and it was difficult. There is a lot of material. You get out of this class what you put into it. I would take her again in a heartbeat."
1077,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,3.0,"Suzy Mathis is like your mom and a professor rolled into one - how can you not succeed with a combination like that? So reasonable with deadlines that I thought I was in the twilight zone! Lots of work and projects, but the load is manageable. She was very clear with her expectations and always available for extra help. She is a dream!"
1078,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"I love Professor Mathis. She is amazing! She explains lecture carefully along with her notes, prepare for doing (a lot of) hw and it worth it. You will be good for test and quiz, will be a ppt about disease but it is a way for you to learn from others. Also, study for bacteria names asap because you need them for the whole semester."
1079,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,Suzy truly loves what she does and it shows. Her lectures were so interesting and engaging. She doesn't make you buy a textbook and gives you all of the materials you need to do well. She is very organized and wants you to get an A! Overall a wonderful professor. Wish she was teaching all science classes so I could take her again.
1080,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,5.0,"Love her! She is super fun and sweet. Made micro so interesting! Expect homework every class, tests are TOUGH. If expecting an easy A, DONT take her!! You must work your butt off, but if you stay on top of your work - you can definitely earn an A. Extra credit is offered, enough that I only needed a 60 on the case studies comp. final to keep my A."
1081,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,MICRO2301,5.0,4.0,One of the best professors. Although the course is hard she explains it very well and makes sure every understands the subject.
1082,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL1308,5.0,3.0,One of the best! She explains things really well and is game to go over it again and again until you get it. She preps you really well for exams so you know exactly what's coming. Always available to talk if you need help. She's awesome!
1083,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,4.0,2.0,"She is one of the best Professors, but if you are a slow learner, take another Professor. She only likes 'A 'students that participate a lot. She has an active personality and if u  try to tell her to calm down, she won't listen, saying it is part of the class(daaaa!). Esp her lab is ridiculously so FAST, you can't even breath. Micro is easy, Chill"
1084,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,4.0,"I would take Suzy for every class if I could.  She made it fun and interesting.  She cares and is passionate about what she does.   There is a quiz  every class, but you can use your homework notes.  The Test are from the homework (and she gives you the answers) There is one big ppt project, so get started on it early.  10/10 for Suzy!"
1085,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,2.0,Suzy is the best teacher ever! Micro is a tough subject she does give out a lot of work but if you just put forth the effort and study you should pass with no problems I got an A easily Attendance does matter if you miss you will get lost but come on guys it's college not high school where the teachers just pass you so you can get out of their hair
1086,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,MICRO2301,5.0,2.0,EASIEST SCIENCE COURSE EVER! she really makes a difficult subject easy. Quizzes are given but its open note. Explains labs/lectures thoroughly and prints notes so you aren't left searching for material. Her labs are fun and upbeat. i would definitely recommend her!
1087,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,4.0,3.0,Wonderful teacher if you do your homework then you should do good on the test. Don't miss because if you miss you could miss key items that she will tell you is specifically on the test. She is always willing to answer a question as long as you have already made an effort to find it yourself and is so enthusiastic about teaching. Don't miss out!!!!
1088,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"Suzy was by far the best professor I have ever taken a class from! She is extremely knowledgeable and can really break down the information. Microbiology is an extremely hard class, so don't expect to be able to just fly by, it takes a lot of studying and dedication!! I learned so much from her and would love to take more classes from her!"
1089,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,5.0,3.0,"Suzy is an awesome person. She is witty and charming, and easy on the eyes. She is smart as a whip and has a story for everything. Although she is a very tough grader, she is VERY clear and concise about what she is looking for while grading. Do yourself a favor and take this class!"
1090,231009,Suzy,Mathis,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO2420,5.0,3.0,She was an absolute amazing teacher she made micro fun and interesting . She let you know what was going to be on tests ahead of time and gave good studying tips. She always answered questions and made sure you understood what was going on. You could use the homework to help on the quizzes. I would take her again!!!!
1092,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2316,4.0,3.0,"I am little late on rating Dr. Blum, I took Ancient Greek Philosophy with her. Our class was small in portion but we had the best discussions and I enjoyed her teaching style for that class. (Although some discussions were not on track) Dr. Blum wants you to learn, so she will give you every chance to do that if you work with her!"
1093,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,1.0,"Prof. Blum is caring and considerate. But her system is confusing, the class does not interest me at all, it is an easy class but the system made it difficult. I felt I just wasted my money and time taking this class. I suggest, better take American History class than any of Ethics or Philosophy class."
1094,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,4.0,4.0,"Class was hard for me. Professor Blum has always responded to emails and answered questions I had. The class I took was entirely online, Discussion board posts required but expectations made clear by a thorough syllabus. Was understanding when it came to changes that arose during covid. Worked my tail off and did my best, Got an A. Thanks Prof. B."
1095,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,5.0,4.0,Be ready to do a lot of reading and a lot of tedious work. Soooo many discussion posts. But she went above and beyond for students during a pandemic with flexibility and understanding. The tedious work also makes writing papers easier.
1096,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,4.0,4.0,"Look, everyone grumbles about Ethics because it is a ton of reading and writing. That's just the nature of it, so you can dismiss the bitter reviews of Blum because those folks would be just as cranky after tying out different professor. Blum is fair, well-organized, there is no dodging the heavy workload but you will learn a lot."
1097,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,4.0,"Tough greader, lots of reading and discussion posts for nothing . No answer for emails no return grades on time. don't take her."
1098,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,4.0,"SAVE YOUR GPA don't take her , very tough grader , late , lazy , we received our grades at the last moment we even couldn't drop, it's too late."
1099,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,4.0,"*Taken during COVID-19* Dr. Blum is a solid professor. She is very smart and explains things well. There is a TON of reading to do, and you have to make comments on each reading online. The tests are hard, but if you study you should be fine. She is a tough grader, but she helps u study. Discussions are engaging. I ended w an A, but I worked HARD."
1100,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,This is by far the worst online class that I have taken. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME NOW AND PICK ANOTHER PROFESSOR. She is not accessible and takes FOREVER to return grades. She has ridiculous amounts of discussion boards that are not graded but count against you if you dont do them. I still dont know what I got on our final (grades are due tonight)
1101,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst, tough grader, gave a lot of discussion posts that takes all your day but not graded , if you don't do it she take of points, only 4 tests and if you do your best, you get like 10 of 25 , which leads you to the first C of your life."
1102,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,4.0,"She was hard to get a hold of, and she's not the easiest grader. Tons of homework and her instructions were vague."
1103,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,HUMA1301,5.0,3.0,"Go to class, participate in discussion, do the assignments, and you'll have an easy A. If you have an issue, talk to her. She's very caring and interested in helping you succeed. She's also a great professor to keep in touch with if you ever need help or advice."
1104,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,3.0,4.0,"So I was really skeptical to choose this professor due to the poor ratings but she was better than the other ratings I saw. I took the 8week online class in the summer . Its a lot of work but every time I texted her she texted me back. Make sure to connect with her, text, go see a tutor at HLC. Shell see your effort &amp; consider it. Put in Effort!"
1105,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,1.0,4.0,"Blogs are time consuming and awfully graded. Doesnt respond to emails, ever! Quizzes are graded incorrectly and you do not get to see what questions you got wrong. Awful professor, stay away"
1106,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,3.0,"Phil. 2306 course on content alone was not a difficult course but the tests had many intrinsic flaws such as multiple choice questions that have two answers with the same text and incomprehensibly ambiguous questions. This made for a HARD A. Sherry also left over half my emails unanswered. Our grades are important to us, please take that srsly"
1107,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,2.0,4.0,Provides helpful podcasts to help explain chapters. Quizs are not horrible but the amount of reading and blogs should weigh in more for grade. Blogs are to be 200words with three responses for each for about 36 chapters. I feel as though she is not fair for having one essay weigh soo much on actual grade. She seems well organized with available
1108,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,4.0,"Distance Learning Course. You will read 31 Ethic-based readings (Aristotle, Kant, O'Neil) and write a 200-word ""blog post"" responding to each reading. Five Unit Quizzes based on readings. 1 Essay that is suggested 1500-2000 words. Your entire grade in the class is based off of your essay grade. VERY Work heavy. Delayed grading. Not much feedback."
1109,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,3.0,"This professor is very difficulty to get feedback from via email or phone. The essay is graded so tough that it takes so many revisions to even be eligible to submit your final draft. The quizzes are difficult, but you get multiple attempts. Very relaxed grader on blog posts. She seems so busy that she can't keep up with communication."
1110,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,4.0,"Course becomes challenging when you reach metaphysics unit. She is accessible &amp; is willing to help explain concepts outside of class. she may post 4 questions days before a test and choose 3 for the test, these will be the mini-essays so write ahead. You will be reading English that is not commonly used &amp; may have trouble understanding them. pt.2/2"
1111,41299,Sherry,Blum,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,4.0,"Lots of HEAVY Reading, frequent homework &amp; 1 essay. Tests are 10ish short answer and 3 mini essays. Pay attention when she compares philosophers and what they may argue on the same topic. Class offers supplemental instruction and office hrs. If you did not read an assignment, DON'T skip class!! Youtube vids also helped. (part 1/2)"
1113,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHICS01429,5.0,5.0,"Major papers required too much wording, and after spending many hours working on them, I still barely made a C. Was not giving us points for posts, but would take points off if you didn't do the posts. Excellent at explaining the discussions on videos. It helped us understand the units."
1114,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306012,3.0,4.0,This course has been challenging. I dont blame Professor Becker tho I just think taking this course durning the pandemic makes it that much harder. If you really focus and set your mind to this class and read the material Thoroughly you will not have a problem.
1115,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,"This was the hardest class I've ever taken. For being in the middle of a pandemic, this class asks too much and Dr. Becker doesn't seem to care about his students success at all. Almost my entire class is failing. The amount of work is overbearing. It seems like even when you're trying your best, you still barely pass :/"
1116,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,3.0,5.0,"This was hardest class I had for the semester. He's not very clear. His lectures are heavy, tiring and wordy. I met with his TA and he was so much more understanding and clear. He spelled it in Lehman terms and I passed. A C but passing. His test are 4 question (300-1000 words each question) There's a paper, oh boy! it nearly killed me."
1117,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306012,1.0,4.0,I should have did research on this professor before signing up for his class. I am fine with a professor who is tough on his students but who is fair. This has been by the worst class I've taken. I did enjoy the readings but this professor sucked the fun out of it. Most of his assignments did not make any sense to me. Have yet to get my final grade
1118,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,4.0,"Hands down Dr. Becker is one of the best teachers I've ever had. His class is difficult and definitely a lot of work, but out of all my ACC classes, I think this is the only one that has prepared me for a four year university. He grades at that level, too. He is very accessible outside class, and there is also a TA who you can go to for extra help."
1119,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2303,1.0,4.0,I am taking his online Phil. course and almost my entire class is failing. His tests are designed to take no less than 2hrs and there is always extra stuff that we never went over on each test. Everything about him and his class is confusing. I asked him a direct question and his response was to ask my classmates (online class). AWFUL PROFESSOR.
1120,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,5.0,"This was my first semester of college, and was not one to be taken lightly. Professor Becker states his expectations clearly, and they must be met to pass. With that being said, his course was a good wake up call for me and I soon realized what it takes to be successful. His class provides education in philosophy as well as good life skills."
1121,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,2.0,5.0,"Definitely, the hardest class I have taken in my entire education. He is a bit aggressive and a really really hard grader. The tests are an open answer and you have to write an essay on basically every question. Definitely a beneficial course where you learn a lot but not as enjoyable when the professor is abrasive and a very direct grader."
1122,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,4.0,"Professor Becker is so so intelligent, learning from him is great. But he won't give you a good grade without the hard work. Notes are graded and there are weekly writings and reading. Tests have essay questions. If you truly want to learn about philosophy and you put in the effort you'll get a good grade and have a good time."
1123,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,3.0,4.0,He doesnt put grades in and when he does it makes no sense because of his grading system. He is really picky about your answers on tests so you need to explain every single thing possible in detail. Theres no extra credit and theres homework every night. The notes also count as a grade which is the only thing that helps your grade in the end.
1124,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Becker expects a lot from his students but it's because he wants his students to do well in their future endeavors. He is always willing to help explain things better during office hours and answer questions, but you need to ask! His class isn't easy but he will push you to do your best work, so take his feedback and apply it to your work."
1125,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,3.0,4.0,"Very challenging Professor. Loves if you participate in class. Emailing him shows that you are trying to understand the material.I took him for Ethics, I likely failed every exam but because I tried to participate in class with the group and him I passed with B. Read the material before class, if you know the material he will love it"
1126,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,4.0,"Definitely on a high horse. Some of my best written papers that I have done in my entire life were for this course, and I came out with C's on most of them. It seems like this professor gets off on his power and doesn't want to see students succeed. And on the final paper for the course, he never told me my grade and he didn't post it on blackboard"
1127,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,It's difficult to receive a good grade on papers; he gives insufficient instructions for all papers; he does respond to emails but has a condescending tone with students; makes the student(s) feel inferior to him; only extra credit given is the writing of 60 additional posts to his Discussion Board post questions; I do not recommend Mr. Becker.
1128,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,4.0,"Donald Becker is perhaps the most outgoing and professional professor I have ever had. He really wants every single one of his students to succeed; it may not seem like that at first due to the rigor of the course, but he genuinely cares for his students. If you wish to get an easy A do not take this class. If you wish to truly learn, take it."
1129,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,4.0,"Couldnt be happier with my choice in taking Professor Becker for ethics! I made an A for the course and though it wasnt easy, it is possible for others to do the same. You need to attend every class, take very good notes, prepare for each test question as the material is being covered, and set up meetings to go over your prepared test answers."
1130,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,1.0,5.0,All this class was Discussion Boards and papers. Everyone seemed to take different amounts of time on it only to barely pass. DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING!
1131,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,ETHIC083,2.0,4.0,"He is a tough grader. He barely gives any extra credit work except to make an additional 60 ""meaningful"" posts to the discussion board. The problem with that is that everyone already has to make two posts to the DB as it is so the question is thoroughly answered and most avenues explored on the topic."
1132,637961,Donald,Becker,Austin Community College,Philosophy,PHIL2306,2.0,4.0,"Four written assignments, no exams/final, &amp; participation on discussion board. What could have been a comfortable course really became frustrating as assignments weren't graded in a timely manner (outside of what is posted in syllabus) and feedback was less than optimal."
1134,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL1406,4.0,3.0,Professor Lai is amazing! This class can be difficult but she makes it enjoyable. If you attend class you will be just fine! She reviews the material a lot &amp; everything she teaches is related to the test. She is also very funny and sweet! She has a little bit of an accent but she is still very clear.
1135,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,3.0,4.0,"Dr. J is really nice and I like her as a person. However, her teaching is very strange. She is overly paranoid about cheating and I frequently do not agree with the way she sets up her quizzes and test questions. I think her lectures are great though."
1136,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,"Professor Lai is the best professor I've had yet! While attendance isn't mandatory for lecture, I would highly recommend attending. Dr. J does an amazing job of explaining the lecture material and will happily answer questions. There's no homework, however, there are pre-lab quizzes (super easy), 4 lecture exams, and 2 lab exams."
1137,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1308,1.0,5.0,Probably the worst teacher you could possibly choose and the tests have no correlation to the notes or anything so its a free for all. Doesnt seem to think that students have lives outside of class so dont expect her to understand if you have an emergency .I honestly dont understand how shes a teacher
1138,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely loved Professor Lai! Biology is a difficult class to take, all around. Of course her lectures had a-lot of information, but that is to be expected. Overall. she is very helpful and gives well explained lectures. She was always happy to answer any questions. My favorite professor so far! Take her if you have the opportunity to!"
1139,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,3.0,"Dr. J. is a fantastic professor!!! No homework, prelab quizzes and postlabs due on Mondays, 4 tests, 2 lab exams, and no homework. DO NOT BE LATE BECAUSE SHE RUNS A TIGHT SHIP! This is not a hard class! She gives giant clues as to what will be on tests. Careful, thoughtful, detailed answers are a must! She makes the BEST BROWNIES in the WORLD, too!"
1140,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Janice is the best, she's extremely direct and forthcoming with what she expects from you regarding what you should know for exams and quizzes. As long as you go to class every week and pay attention you will learn everything you need to know and get a good grade."
1141,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,"Professor Lai was the best. I wish all my teachers were like her. Her lectures are clear, concise, and directly relate to what's on the tests. She will let you know if something is important to know. You do a lab write up every week, some are long some are short. No homework besides that. She prints up the powerpoints for you. Very helpful!"
1142,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,2.0,"Dr. J is a fantastic professor. She takes a class as complicated and difficult as biology and makes it as straight-forward and easy to understand as possible. She's very good at communicating, and is more than willing to re-explain a concept multiple times. Exams don't hold any kind of surprises, as she's very specific about what will be on it."
1143,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,Dr. J is amazing. material can be a little difficult or confusing but she's always willing to help if you ask.
1144,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Lai is an amazing professor, although her exams can be challenging - she fully prepares you as her lectures are so thorough and clear. I still remember the concepts she drilled in my head a year ago, and she's also very sweet and is willing to reach out and help if you are lost or need additional help."
1145,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,1.0,5.0,"Wow, sad to see the ratings on here are so high, it was one of the reasons I took her, and was SO disappointed! I ended up dropping the class a little over half way! Which sucked! There is no homework to help you. The only you have is her powerpoint lectures and hints she provides. I studied ALOT and made a B and then a C on the 2 tests. Good luck"
1146,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1306,5.0,5.0,"Great teacher, the class is just hard. I would not take this unless you plan on becoming a biologist. LIke do not take this just to fulfill a credit. Take someone else."
1147,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,3.0,5.0,"Dont take her if you have a busy schedule. Really strict on time, you cant take the quiz or turn in paper even one minute late, no extra credit, and picky on grading lab assignments."
1148,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,"She's a professor that is full of energy and is pretty entertaining. Don't be late to class if something is due!! She is very strict on deadlines and does not allow late work (even if it's a minute late). She is very organized, and teaches efficiently and effectively. Tests are cumulative, so there is no final."
1149,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor - I miss her class already! Dr. Lai is passionate about the subject matter and passionate about her students. She is kind and funny, and definitely available outside of class to help you. She is a tough grader but provides plenty of feedback. Attend class, start studying regularly right away, and you will be successful!"
1150,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIOL1406,4.0,4.0,"Her energy helps you focus and she really cares about the subject. Every test is short answer so you have to know the material, but this gives you more opportunity to earn partial credit. She provides you with slides if you show up and is always available and accommodating in certain situations. Take this class if you're a STEM major for sure."
1151,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lai is the BEST professor to take Cellular/Molecular Biology with. She made this course fun, interesting, and easy to understand. She tells you from the beginning when you will have a quiz, when your postlabs are due, and she goes by the deadlines in the syllabus."
1152,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,A wonderful professor! Interesting and engaging lectures and labs. Always puts extra credit on tests. Always puts metric conversions on tests.
1153,1142251,Janice,Lai,Austin Community College,Biology,BIO1406,5.0,4.0,Janice was amazing. She loves biology and her students and genuinely wants to see them succeed. Her lectures are long so bring coffee. She hints at material that will be heavily covered in a test so keep an eye out. She can be a little nit picky with grading but nothing extreme. READ LABS BEFOREHAND and you will get 100 on the quiz. labs are easy
1155,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,4.0,2.0,"if you just keep up with the tests and discussion boards, it's easy to pass. there aren't any hw assignments or quizzes. 4 tests, 4 discussion boards, and 1 paper"
1156,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,5.0,5.0,"Prof, Shina is a great professor. Shina is ready to push you towards achieving all your goals in the class. I almost gave up on the class when Shina told me not to and provided the necessary info I needed in order to pass the class. I am so grateful because I would have waited to take this class again but thanks to Prof, Shina I passed with a B!!"
1157,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,"What a great professor you seriously have to really try and not pass! I'm a average student and I'm able to get an A in his class. He gives a ton of extra credit, 3 test, 1 paper. GO TO CLASS! His power points are not very organized well if you don't know whats going on or no taking notes what helped me was to print the review and follow that way."
1158,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,3.0,1.0,"I took this class online. Let me be the one to say, study the questions in the book and his review and you will get an A on all the test. Discussions Boards and papers are very easy; I am no author but I did fairly well on these. Take this professor, easy A. Btw, I did not read a single chapter, just skimmed through and did good."
1159,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,2.0,3.0,"This was my first time taking an online class and it's safe to say I will personally never do it again. You have a paper, discussion boards, and exams and sure that's less work, but that's all you're graded on. He gives extra credit and I HIGHLY recommend using that to your advantage (I could've got an A)."
1160,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,3.0,3.0,"I like him as a person, but not as a professor. He's humorous during class and we have a free online textbook. The problem is that he spends so much time going off-topic by bringing up controversial matters and letting students argue over it most of class.... Then he goes over stuff that matters for tests way too fast to compensate for time lost."
1161,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOT2306,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor! he knows his stuff and is really good at giving lectures that you understand and can laugh at. He also facilitates class discussions and brings out ideas that most people don't think about. He uses methods that keep you engaged. One class we watched a futurama and talked about how it related to our current government.
1162,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,1.0,5.0,"This professor was so bad! I'm taking him online and he's a tough grader and when you email him he won't respond until a week later. The online class is basically reading the book and that's it. No homework, no lecture. Just read the book. Also, 3 exams witch it's timed 45 minutes and a ""optional"" short answer witch it's not timed separately."
1163,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,5.0,3.0,"Professor Amachigh is awesome! His class is fair easy but you have to work hard to get an A. He likes to bring up controversial topics for class debates to keep lecture fun. The book is online, but tests are based on his lectures so try to be in class. He doesn't like students leaving his lecture early unless to tell him your reason beforehand."
1164,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,USGOVT2305,3.0,3.0,"He is hard to follow, but he reads off his powerpoint every class. He is ok."
1165,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Amachigh was a fair teacher. Everything is in the syllabus, no surprises. Her class consisted of four Discussion Board posts, three exams, one essay, and optional extra credit. Her exams are hard. You have to make sure to read the textbook and study. If you do that than the exams aren't too bad. She allows you to retest at the end of the term."
1166,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,"PLEASE TAKE THIS ONLINE! His Gov 1 class was sooo incredibly easy as long as you follow the syllabus, do the work, and spend a minimal amount of time. Tests are taken at home and most questions are directly from the questions in the book. SO MUCH extra credit. I finished this online class in 19 days and got an A."
1167,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,4.0,2.0,"Very upfront about what was required to pass the class, I received the syllabus a week before class started. Although the textbook is large, I highly advise reading it. I will say that a lot of class time was spent discussing semi-related political topics rather than the government itself. Also, he did not push his political beliefs on us."
1168,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,4.0,Dr. Amachigh is amazing!! His class is really easy if you attend classes. No homework. Plenty of extra credits! you need to work hard if you want an A.
1169,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,I usually suck at government/history classes but by just participating and going to class I was able to keep my grade good. He also gives extra-credit opportunities and provides test review outlines for each test. He lectured and went along with power points so it was pretty easy to follow. My best advice would just be to participate and LISTEN
1170,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOT2306,1.0,5.0,"He is very tough grader and doesn't let you re-take the discussion board he says to come up yourself very intimidating with every email I wrote to him, super annoying and know it all kinda guy 50 question test is for 45 minutes which pass thankfully some of them in quizlet. I am not even talking about the paper there is no specific subject to write"
1171,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,3.0,3.0,"Professor Amachigh is really nice and understanding. I ended up dropping this class because I missed a test on accident. You have an opportunity at the end of the semester to redo a test but the class ended up being really hard and confusing. The only grades that go in are tests and a paper, so it's difficult to redeem yourself if you don't do well"
1172,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOT2306,3.0,4.0,"This was the second time I've taken Dr. Amachigh, and I really don't know why I did. He has a heavy accent and is difficult to understand. His power points are incredibly difficult to understand if you review them on your own. Doesn't really have structure. Very opinionated, throws controversial topics at student and they take up most of the class"
1173,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,1.0,4.0,"I took this class online. Unfortunately, I felt as though Professor Amachigh did not respond to emails w/i a reasonable time, delayed more than other professors to post grades, tough grader for sure and whatever you do be very thorough on the discussion boards b/c she will ding your grade if you are not. Would def not recommend her."
1174,1313293,Shina,Amachigh,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2305,1.0,4.0,"Test review? Whats that? Well we read chapters 1,2,3,4. So you need to know everything there. Run, don't walk, away from this Prof (not a teacher). Good luck!!"
1176,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,5.0,"Do not Take him! He is extremely tough grader, and he will not give you one extra point. He takes many points out of your HW, if you miss one thing. Do not take him."
1177,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2414,5.0,3.0,"Edgar is the most real, energetic, inspiring guy you will ever meet. I always struggled in math, but after Edgar's course, I love it. He made math organized, teaching in a way that allows you to categorize problems and follow step-by-step paths a result. ABSOLUTELY TAKE HIM IF YOU GET THE CHANCE. (He bakes cookies for the final &lt;3)"
1178,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,1.0,"Hard class, super nit picky in terms of grades, doesn't seem to care about students or anyone other than his image. Very cocky and rude individual. Needs to work on this and be super consistent with everything. Simple notes but difficult homework assign. Exam 2, 3, and 4 should be in testing center and not in classroom (not a lot of time to finish)"
1179,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,1.0,5.0,"I was ready to transfer to Texas A&amp;M engineering which requires at least grade B in all transferable courses. After taking a class with this teacher, my A&amp;M engineering journey has ended. I like this teacher so much."
1180,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,5.0,"Toughest teacher in math! Don't imagine to get an A in his class unless you are taking only one his class for the semester. Very tough on test grade. If you want a good grade and keep your GPA high, don't take his class because your grade from his class only down your overall GPA."
1181,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,CAL1,1.0,5.0,"Not too good teacher. Very very tight on points. He thinks points are his pocket property. If you go to his office hour for help, he will not help you instead he let you to solve the problem yourself. If I was able to do that why would I go to in his office hour?"
1182,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0370,1.0,5.0,"First of all,  a professional professor aren't supposed make you question why you're in their class. Secondly, making slightly comments towards students is against syllabus rules. He don't offer any assistant to help you pass his class. What a waste of my money, I recommend pass your TSI, or the free math class than wasting your money."
1183,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0370,1.0,4.0,"I had a bad experience with trying to communicate with this professor. When I needed help, he didn't provide me any resources and there was a lack of communication and I never got the help I needed in passing the course."
1184,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2415,5.0,3.0,Professor Fisher is amazing!! I had him for Calculus 3 and he made it so much fun!! I looked forward to going to his class even though it was at 9 a.m. He honestly cares a lot for his students and will help you in any way. He does go fast in lecture but he is always availabe in office hours and will help. We never left a class without laughing!!
1185,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,5.0,Very tough teacher! very picky. Too much works. Takes a lot points off. Very tough grader. It is really hard to get a good grade in the class. I would have taken the class with another prof. if I knew it.
1186,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD0370,5.0,4.0,"I am NOT a math person, but professor Fisher is the best math teacher i've ever had. He is so engaging and makes things easy to understand. I want to drop the math I am taking now just to take his class again. He is truly an amazing teacher and he genuinely cares about his students. Yes, he does give a lot of homework, but it is reasonable."
1187,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATD3070,5.0,3.0,"Amazing teacher! I never liked math whatsoever, but Fisher's teaching is so funny and extremely helpful! I was never great at math but his teaching skills have help by so much. He's entertaining and always makes sure you understand what goes on, especially if you're shy to speak up. (never calls you out) would take again!!!"
1188,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH1413,5.0,4.0,"Calculus is very hard and this teacher knows that and is willing to work with you to help you understand and pass. He's hilarious, inventive, and patient. I took his CAL 2 and 3 classes after having to drop CAL 2 bc of the boring lecture style teacher. Me and my classmates would all go to his office hours and do the hmwk together with his help."
1189,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,1.0,4.0,"One of the most cockiest professors here. Be sure not take him. It will get extremely rough from the start. He's very quick in his lectures and will most likely give you basic (not hard) examples. Then, he will give you more challenging problems on homework assignments. Also, you will not have enough time to complete exam some are taken in class."
1190,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2414,5.0,5.0,"You have to work pretty hard for an A or B in his class but not impossible. Hes always available in his office hours and willing to help you even in the dumb questions. Hes test are long but if you understand the concepts and know the steps, you should be fine."
1191,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,1.0,5.0,DO NOT take him! You have been warned! Lectures too fast &amp; expects you to do hard and tedious problems on the worksheets quizzes and exams. Hes cocky asf and more interested in proving hes good at math than you actually learning the material. The tests are in class so you wont have enough time to finish HIS exams!
1192,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,2.0,5.0,Try not to take high level math classes with him. It is hard to earn a good grade with him. Anyone can pass if they work hard but not good grade. Test questions are totally different than what you have done in the class and much more harder than in class. You don't even know where those tests questions are came from. Very picky teacher.
1193,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"Okay, I know that most people would complain that Professor Fisher does his lectures pretty fast. But overall, I think that he is really funny and helps a lot of students out by giving them tips and tricks with their Calculus 2 homework. We do have quizzes everyday (each 15 minutes long and 3-5 questions), but I still would recommend him for Cal 2."
1194,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"Favorite professor I've had. Absolutely hilarious, loves what he teaches, wants everyone to succeed. There's a quiz done in class and a worksheet to turn in virtually every class. It's not an easy class, but he's an awesome guy and if you're willing to work a little bit then you'll have a great semester and really understand what you're learning."
1195,1110623,Edgar,Fisher,Austin Community College,Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,5.0,"Perfect teacher. Very attentive during lecture; notices confusion on people's faces and addresses it. Constantly makes you laugh. Delivers the material in a very clear way, but he moves quickly and gives lots of quizzes. I find this to be helpful as it keeps your butt in gear. You have to stay on top of math. Will take for cal2!"
1197,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,3.0,2.0,"EASY. 1st test-read everything + filled out tons of maps, not needed. 2nd test-did the sample questions in reading, did online vocab/practice quizzes and realized doing ONLY that + accessing his old ppts with the quiz questions were verbatim test questions. The paper was tedious. The book on ""how to pass"", don't buy it. Not kind in email."
1198,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,2.0,4.0,"Took this class online. Downloaded book using my Kindle Fire which was convenient. Completely reading and test heavy - multiple choice. He provided a ""study guide,"" but instead of giving you a focus on what to study, it literally is just bullet points of the entire book- so lots of info no direction on what to expect on test - difficult to study."
1199,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,1.0,4.0,"This is the ONLY Texas history professor at ACC. Took online. If you take class, take by itself due to tons of time consuming reading. Has broad study guide that SOME test questions come from. Tests have 30 questions. He is an historian and expects you to be one too. He stresses reading comprehension. I stress DO NOT take his class."
1200,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,3.0,3.0,"I was prepared for a horrible class based on other reviews. I've had harder classes. Lots of reading, but that's any online class since there are no lectures. I had never written a paper with an annotated bibliography/footnotes but it wasn't too bad Work hard, read the book, communicate with him, and I DIDN'T BUY HIS BOOK. Use the study guide!"
1201,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,This man does not care about you and will never hear you out. He despises helping and is by far the rudest professor I've ever met in my 3 years of college experience. When you need assistance he will not give it to you. When you need to reach him get ready to wait 4 days for a response. He's condescending and unapproachable. Horrid people person.
1202,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,1.0,4.0,Study guide is useless. And you have to be very particular with what you remember to do well on tests. If you can avoid this texas history class you should.
1203,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,1.0,4.0,"5 tests each over 100 pages of the textbook and only 30 questions, optional research paper for an A or book report for a B. Score 24/30 or above (not accumulative) on each test for an automatic B, no paper necessary. Easily over 12 hours of reading each week the study guide is useless and misleading. Save yourself the stress, don't take his class."
1204,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,4.0,4.0,I took this Texas History class online and it is a very tough class to take. There is a ton of reading in this class and its a lot of hard work so make sure you have the time to commit to this class. Dr. Tijerina has a very structured grading system so make sure you pay attention to all of his requirements.
1205,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,1.0,5.0,"ACC needs to get another Texas history professor. He has a very broad study guide, and super specific test questions. His tests only have 30 questions and there is too much information for only 30 questions. He is rude and not very helpful when you reach out. Also, he knows the book because he is a historian and expects you to be one too."
1206,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,2.0,"Don't trust everything he says. His lectures are more like rants you'd expect to hear from someone like Don Lemon on CNN. He will intentionally skew history to fit his narrative, do your own research and you'll find he often makes up information or generalizes the culprits to demonize anything anglo-american. Easy class otherwise."
1207,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"Online? READ!! Get the study manual! If you read and try to understand the stuff, you will do fine! A lot of test questions came from the study manual! I came shy of the B at the end by 1 point and he went ahead and gave me a B! He seems reasonable if you are honest and try!"
1208,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,"I know college is challenging, however it shouldnt make you feel like youre there to fail. In my experience, I felt lost. I bought the required materials for this class, and it still wasnt enough. The questions from the tests were tricky, almost like he was setting up students to fail. Dont take his class."
1209,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed taking Professor Tijerinas class. I took the 8 weeks course which wasnt easy to start with but he was a great professor. He has long lectures. But literally everything you need for his tests are in his lectures. So if youre have to miss class, make sure you get someones notes! Hes kind of funny and really cares about his students."
1210,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST2301,2.0,5.0,"Took Hist of Texas summer 2018. Had to drop. Graded on 5 tests, all of them very difficult. Strict with communication. Reading  3 (long) chapters a week for a 6 week class. Don't make my mistake, either take a different class for your degree or take it NOT online. As it was online I never met the dude so he could be really nice but idk man."
1211,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST086,4.0,4.0,"I took his DIL course. It's simple. Read the syllabus, do the homework, get the grade you deserve. He has you buy his book and study guide. The study guide is KEY. Everything that is on the test is from the study guide. He was very clear on the syllabus. So much that he repeated and wrote in bold what students normally scan over and miss."
1212,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,Essay questions are long and his tests are purely from book. Most of test questions are not as discussed but mainly open ended questions are covered. Reading the textbook is a big part of passing this class. Overall mediocre experience.
1213,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,ENGL2301,3.0,4.0,"Youre paying for the textbook and the credit with this class. Read the textbooks and take the tests. Its dissapointing, because Professor Tijerina is a well respected historian and if he had any input in the course aside from writing the syllabus it would be much appreciated. However, he grades fairly."
1214,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,SAVE YOURSELF!!! I would never have taken a class by this person if I had read about him on here first. What a nightmare. I remember getting emails from people failing his class (the majority did). His exams ask the most random questions and they are worded to set you up. His questions are based on his opinions &amp; views not straight facts.
1215,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"If you want to learn US history and eventually find yourself applying skills gained from this class to others, take this course. He teaches you how to analyze history, which is arguably the most important skill we have to resist irrational actors. 120 pages / month. 5 tests, 1 A-Level Research paper or 1 B-Level research paper if you want a B"
1216,243026,Andres,Tijerina,Austin Community College,History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"He would not help me with a simple question, and disregarded my attempts to reach out to him multiple times, which were in correct syllabus required format. I submitted the 11 page essay with an A, and he changed my grade to a B after I turned it in, as to disqualify my essay from grading. Tijerina does not care for his students whatsoever."
1218,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,Professor Wilson was SO SWEET! I took her online class and every single little video she made me smile. Always submit rough drafts of your paper if you can. She gives great feedback and will let you know exactly what to fix. She responds to emails quickly and if you work hard you will get the A!
1219,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,1.0,She is the best professor and encourage the student to be creative
1220,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,2.0,Mrs. Wilson is very energetic and caring. She gives awesome feedback on your writing. I would take her again in a heartbeat.
1221,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,2.0,"I love Professor Wilson! One of the best English Professors for Comp 1. I am so grateful that I took her over the semester! You guys HAVE to take her, you won't regret it!"
1222,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,2.0,"She is a ball of energy. She genuinely cares about her students and wants everyone to pass. Her class is very simple. Follow the syllabus, do the work and you'll pass."
1223,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,2.0,She is the best I have seen. I will take her class again for English2. Classes are fun. She is very energetic and easy to understand.
1224,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,4.0,1.0,"I loved having her as a professor. She gives excellent feedback on your essays if you decide to come to the workdays, so take advantage of it if you want an A in the class."
1225,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,I had an early morning class with her and did not expect to feel so energized because of her amazing energy. She has the best humor and really cares for every single person in that class. You need to go to class everyday and you will easily get an A.
1226,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,4.0,2.0,Nice and funny
1227,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,I love her she is very kind!
1228,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Wilson is an amazing professor, I came in with little essay writing ability and left the class confident in my writing. Attendance is mandatory and she will drop you from the class if you miss to much. She is very bubbly and outgoing so prepare for her to yell (with excitement). Gives lots of extra credit, I ended the class with over a 100."
1229,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"Took Comp I as a required course, but SO glad I chose Mrs. Wilson. Attendance is mandatory, but she always made the class interesting and exciting with her bubbly personality. Do the short readings to prepare for quizzes in class and put effort into your papers -- your grade will reflect your effort. Very easy to earn an A. She truly is a gem!"
1230,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,"I had professor Wilson last semester and she was great. I really recommend her class if youre not that great with writing. She gives great feed back on youre essays, and gives very informative lectures. She cares about her students and makes sure everyone is doing their best."
1231,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"I took Ms. Wilson in the fall of 2018 for Composition 1. She was the funniest teacher I have ever had and wanted so badly to see everyone get an A. Don't be on your cell phone, work hard, and pay attention. She will be the best prof you have ever had."
1232,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Wilson is very funny and extremely sweet.
1233,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Wilson is one of the best professors I've had in my entire college career. She is kind, thoughtful, funny, and caring. Furthermore, her classes are engaging as well as the paper assignments. Do yourself a favor and take her. It'll be one of the best decisions you make."
1234,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,"It's an English coarse that focuses on essay writing, you're going to write lots of papers. Prof Wilson is a very fair grader and allows for corrections. She's super funny in her lectures and wants to get you engaged. She cares about you as a person and will try very hard to meet you on your level. Her main goal is to help you succeed."
1235,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,2.0,"I took Mrs. Wilson's 8-week course and I was nervous it'd be too fast a pace. She gave one paper a week, and it was not that bad. I have never been good at English, but she made it very enjoyable. She was relatable and easy to talk. She states exactly what she's looking for and grading is clear. She is by far one of the best teachers I've ever had."
1236,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"I was so nervous about taking this class but Mrs. Wilson put me at ease. She is funny, makes English interesting (whoa who knew), and I looked forward to her classes every week. You have to care about the papers or you will fail. Also, paying her respect, being honest, and being present in class will take yÃ¸u far. YOU WON'T REGRET TAKING THIS CLASS"
1237,331386,Sarah,Wilson,Austin Community College,English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Wilson is a great English teacher. She loves what she does and makes the class really fun. Write those essays &amp; show up to class and you will pass, easy. Her grading is lenient as long as your paper is grammatically and punctually correct so take your essays to an English tutor to be revised before turning it in."
1239,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,3.0,"His lectures and demonstrations really hit the mark. He will challenge you on the exams, but I consider them fair. Essays on exams are fairly easy to plan for if you pay attention in class. Homework is interesting and applicable to real life. Pfr. Hunt has been teaching for many years and knows how to keep the class interested."
1240,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,4.0,2.0,He was fun to listen too&amp; his lectures were really interesting. He is nice if you respect his boundaries &amp; answer his questions other than saying 'don't know'. His tests are super easy for As if you take good notes. Overall nice but he can be really hard sometimes and will tell you to leave the class if you can't think of something to answer him.
1241,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,Prof. Hunt was the best teacher ever. He was sweet and always available to chat when you needed him.
1242,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,5.0,4.0,"Very intelligent and is engaging despite the length of class. Do not miss class, he is kind when you respect his boundaries but calls out discrepancies."
1243,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV1301,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Hunt makes learning politics fun. He gives amazing lectures so if you take good notes, you will do great on his tests. He is funny and has interesting teaching techniques that keep you interested. You will never be bored. He has a zero "" no cellphone "" tolerance which I greatly respect. I wish all my professors were are clear as him."
1244,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Hunt is a great professor. He's extremely knowledgeable about government, and passionate about it too! This is the first time I've actually ENJOYED a govt class. His sense of humor is great, he goes over test reviews, and is just an awesome guy. He has Powerpoints mostly for visual aids - not to take crazy notes from. Come to class, &amp; have fun!"
1245,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,1.0,5.0,"It's honestly 50/50 with this teacher. I dropped out the second week. Rude, failure to help his students, and belligerent. First day of class he bragged about how he had read students comments on here that he has no soul and just laughed about it. Very unprofessional in his method of typing when you email him, makes you feel like your stupid."
1246,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Hunt was honestly the best professor I've ever had. He truly made me have a better understanding and passion for government, which past instructors have been unable to do. He loves to engage the entire class in discussion; yes, he is lecture-heavy, but he breaks to introduce interactive discussions as well. Don't use your phone in class."
1247,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2305,1.0,3.0,Rudest prof ive ever had. Ive never had a teacher who just looks at me and doesnt respond after ive tried to have a conversation with them. Its awkward and straight up disrespectful. Also I hope you dont have a personal life because this professor doesnt care. Dirty looks and a negative attitude are everyday things in his class.
1248,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hunt was one of those professors who left me a more knowledged student and he is one of my favorite profs. Took both his state and us govt classes, and it's an easy A, but not too easy of an A.  He is very knowledgeable about government since he worked in state government and his lectures are simple but very informative."
1249,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hunt is Great! His lectures were on point, explanations was easy to understand and test were not difficult if you study the material in his lectures and power point slide he has. Do not get the book, got an A without it. Oh and don't use your phone in class."
1250,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,2.0,"His Lectures are easy to follow, he lets you know what's on the test on what it isn't. He is there to pass you n not to fail you or make your life a living hell. just take good notes, follow his rules, show up to every class and study your notes. and don't buy the book. it's a waste of money. He is great guys, easy A if you study his lectures."
1251,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hunt delivers great lectures. Be very attentive in his class. He would explain each and every thing in his lecture without looking at book. Be ready to take notes hi his class. His exams will completely based on his lectures. So, if you attend his classes seriously, you would get an easy ""A""."
1252,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,2.0,"I took the hybrid class. His lectures were actually really good, in my opinion. His test are mostly lecture base, shouldn't be too hard to get a A if you studied. He does give a bit of assignments outside of class over the course but those are not difficult . Definitely would favor the hybrid class over the normal one."
1253,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,5.0,2.0,"SUPER EASY CLASS. He involves the students in his conversations, and his lectures can be a bit dry and boring, but he covers everything you need to know for the tests. He gives study guides and you have to do a few worksheets. 3 exams, can do a 4th to replace one of the three tests if you have a bad grade. Really sweet and passionate person"
1254,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV1301,5.0,3.0,Prof. Hunt is hands down my favorite professor I've ever had. He inspires me to want to do better for myself and for the people I'm surrounded by. He's down to earth and on occasion he made me laugh out loud (granted I was laughing alone).  He's understanding and lays everything out for you in the syllabus.. Take notes and only miss class if ness.
1255,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2302,5.0,3.0,"Mr hunt is the greatest college professor i have taken thus far. I got a high A in his US government class and didn't have to work extremely hard. He has extremely lenient grading policies and will drop your lowest test score if you take the 4th test. He's also very friendly, hilarious and inspirational. The only person who made Gov fun!!!"
1256,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOVT2302,5.0,3.0,Hunt is a great professor.  He is extremely passionate about what he does and he passes hi exuberance onto his students.  Definitely a great professor for Texas Government
1257,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,1.0,4.0,"I don't recommend him for a online class, the assignments are easy but when it comes to taking the test it was rather difficult. You have 4 test through out the semester and the final is optional but without passing those test you will not pass the class unfortunately even with the assignments being all 10's and he does not give extra credit."
1258,551264,Glen,Hunt,Austin Community College,Government,GOV2306,1.0,4.0,Would not recommend taking this course online. It is 100% reading the info out of the textbook and memorizing it. He does not provide any lectures or PowerPoint to help with the material and the online assignments were unrelated to what was on the tests.
1260,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"An extremely hard professor probably the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Test heavy he does not give you back your exam when finished so you can not review your mistakes. during quarantine we did not meet at all online, he was only sending emails with notes that were written in cursive making it hard to comprehend."
1261,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,Dont take him hes no help. You cant understand him at all. Were in quarantine and his notes are written in sloppy cursive.
1262,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"One time a student was getting up got up 2 times to use the bathroom , he got mad &amp; started talking bad expected us to agree with him &amp; laugh. Get a bad attitude when a student ask a question, cant study from notes because theyre all over the place, doesnt know how to teach , have bad handwriting so its hard to understand what he writes."
1263,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"Literally does not teach anything. Walks into class late every single day. Copies the example the book gives you on the board and thats it, thats how he teaches. Lets say you have to use the restroom, once you walk out he stares at the door and complains in front of the class that you left. He always makes mistakes when showing an example."
1264,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,4.0,"ONLY graded by tests (30% accumulative final, 70% other tests). Textbook not mandatory. Tests are scantron, open book &amp; open note. If you come to every class ON TIME &amp; DON'T leave early he will give extra credit. Poor teaching methods &amp; you'll more than likely have to teach yourself. Constantly complains about random stuff &amp; can be a little rude."
1265,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,2.0,4.0,"He only grades by tests. You can choose to do homework or not, you do not have to buy the book and all the tests were open note and open book. However, I didn't like that his grading was only dependent on tests, he isn't the best at explaining things and often complains about such small things that students would do. I personally do not recommend."
1266,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT2023,1.0,3.0,He is a pretty bad professor. His notes are garbage to look at and you basically end up needed to teach yourself because you learn just as much with or without him there. He goes off on tangents like spending 20mins talking about rhinos and he jumps around teaching one section for one class then jumping to another the very next class.
1267,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"Nice professor, bad teaching methods. Teaches chapter out of order. Moves on to different chapter before giving test for previous. Only grades test. Never goes back over the test. Open book and notes, but can't understand my notes. Needed to make my own notes. No other grades, like quizzes and HW to balance test grades. Extra credit won't help."
1268,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,Great professor!!! Lots of extra credits. Come to class everyday
1269,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"hes the best professor ever dont believe the other comments, take this class, go everyday and you will end up with a good grade!!!"
1270,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,4.0,"Professor Piotr was alright. Stats is a difficult subject for me so I had to work harder for a good grade. Grades only on tests and final no graded homework. Take good notes and get the book, you can use them on each test. Gives 10 extra points if you don's miss class. Overall, study to do good on tests and try not to miss class to get extra points"
1271,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STATS2023,5.0,1.0,the best
1272,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,2.0,"This professor helps you so much, he gives extra 10 points on each test if you go to his class everyday.. he can get off topic a few times but believe you will be happy you got him. if you study a lil you will pass."
1273,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"This teacher may be a bit soft spoken but not hard to understand, especially if you're brave enough to ask. He's patient and doesn't mind going over the content again in class for those who don't get it. He also added extra credit towards the tests if you get to class on time. I'd take him again if I could."
1274,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"I thought i was decent at math, this man made me realize i know nothing. the book is wrong to him, he knows everything about mathematics. he believes if you use mathematics you can never get confused.i'm gonna keep it real with you, do not and i repeat DO NOT take this class. this man will convince you are stupid. he tells a lot of useless stories."
1275,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,4.0,4.0,He really knows math!
1276,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,1.0,5.0,"He is very difficult to understand. He goes off topic... ALOT. He goes over several topics before a test and only tests on one of the topics. He is argumentative if you do not understand something. He isn't a ""teaching"" type of professor. He is more of a ""telling"" professor. None of the concepts are explained, you must teach yourself. Don't do it."
1277,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,2.0,4.0,"I just managed to just get by. He would trail off and talk about random things that have nothing to do with math. I don't think that he's someone that is easy to approach. One good thing is that he is very generous when it comes to extra credit if you always show up to class. Also, I never used the textbook so that was a waste of money."
1278,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"This man has to be one of the worst professors ive ever had in life. This man doesnt teach you, he teaches at you. He lectures and does problem on the board all class without really explaining anything in depth or even asking student for questions. Theirs no homework, no real in class assignments for practice. DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN AT ALL COST."
1279,619490,Piotr,Galkowski,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,3.0,5.0,"his accent makes him more difficult. if you're late your absent, if you're  on time everyday you get extra credit and you will need it. he starts a topic then goes to another and the test is on the first topic, the after the test he's on topic 3 and the next test is going to be on the second topic you did. its just kind of confusing. teach yourself"
1281,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"She is one of the nicest teachers I have met, super funny and will always answer your questions. She will give you tons of opportunities to bring up your grades. Just put in the work and effort and she will help you pass."
1282,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"Professor Easley is amazing, she cares about her students. Due to the COVID pandemic, we went fully online and she managed everything perfectly. Her grading criteria is clear, do your work, the labs, and go to class and you will pass! She gives you extra credit opportunities. No book required. I would take her again!"
1283,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"This is first time I have received an A in a math course. She is a really nice woman, and if you show up for class and take good notes, the rest is easy. There are many extra credit opportunities and the homework grade will boost your grade by a lot! She is always willing to help, even during office hours. If you put in the effort, you'll pass."
1284,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"She knows her stuff. She can go a little too fast, but she is always there to help if you have a question. I suck at math and passed with an A. Just do the homework (which helps a lot), pay attention in class and you will be fine. I would take her again."
1285,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,4.0,"Absolutely awful. She goes TOO FAST. If you struggle in math and can't learn from reading definitions, DON'T TAKE HER CLASS! There are SEVEN grades total in the class. If you can't print the numerous worksheets for extra credit, you won't be eligible for a grade change. So, once you fail a test in her class, you need all As or you fail."
1286,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,4.0,"Shes a nice professor, but she works way too fast and when youre wanting to write down the notes shes writing she erases and goes to the next being that we need notes in our notebook for points. I have to watch other professors on Youtube to understand the topic which is kind of sad."
1287,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"She's a great professor. I'd definitely take her for my other math courses in the future. She can also go kinda fast during lectures but if you tell her to slow down she will. Also, she gives extra credit. I say even if youre doing well in her class still do the extra work because it helps with your grade in the end."
1288,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"Easiest class I've ever taken. I took it for dual enrollment and it did not cause me any problems, as long as you study, show up to class and pay attention, you'll pass."
1289,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Professor Easley is one of the best teachers I've ever had. I've had her for both MAT1033/MAC1105 this semester &amp; plan on taking her again in the fall for MGF1106. Even though both were 8 week classes, she certainly makes it doable. Keep up with the online work, take advantage of every extra credit opportunity, go to class each day and youll be ok."
1290,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"She is amazing, she is so helpful outside of class if you don't understand the subject she will help you. study her test reviews and do the homework on time you will pass the class. I am extremely bad at math but with her, she made everything easy."
1291,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,THE BEST TEACHER EEEEEEVVVVEEEERRRR!!!! I highly highly HIGHLY RECCOMEND HER IF YOU WANT TO PASS A MATH CLASS.
1292,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,I loved her class so much shes an amazing teacher . I hated math I still kinda do but she made me hate it a little less . If you just do the homework everyday and practice you will pass the class with a high grade . If you skip her class you will miss a lot of stuff and she gives test reviews before the test and answers questions
1293,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,3.0,Professor Easley is the best math teacher I've ever had. She explains concepts so well and is especially patient. She constantly reviews material and provides lots of opportunities for extra credit. I'd been out of school for 10 years and failed my math classes in high school; I passed her class with nearly a 100%. I highly recommend her!
1294,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2010,5.0,3.0,Her class was extremely fair. She is such a sweet lady! Just pay attention and do all your homeworks and youll pass. She is accesible outside of class and willing to help. She also offers extra credit that brought my grade from a low B to a High A. Take her! Its not an easy A but its worth your money b/c youll learn and love statistics :)
1295,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"It is kinda funny that the students who are not prepared and don't want to work don't like her. The students who are prepared and want to learn, do their work and love her. She teaches really well and gives good examples as well as lots of tricks. I think she is just the best teacher I have had so far!!!"
1296,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,"She really knows her stuff and is very helpful after class, however, if youre someone who hasnt been in school for awhile I would pick another teacher. She goes way to fast to fully grasp the concept at times. She teaches as if she assumes all her students just graduated high school for the most part."
1297,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"If you are not good in math, this is the professor for you. Ive taken her for MAT0057, MAT1033, and MAC1105. She is absolutely amazing at teaching. She makes difficult concepts seem like a breeze. So sad shes not teaching STA1001, but hopefully I can take her for STA2023."
1298,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"Professor Easley is extremely caring and understanding. If you don't understand something, don't worry because she'll break it down for you by going over all the steps, even the easy ones, when working out a problem. Homework online, but not difficult. 4 tests, 1 final. Not a difficult class. Extra credit opportunities."
1299,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,If you do not like MAT 1033/MAC 1105 blended/fast track then this is the prof for you. She will answer ALL your questions without making you feel stupid for asking. She responds to emails in a timely manner and gives extra credit left and right. I took her for MAT 1033 and taking her now for MAC 1105. I wish she was teaching MAC 1114/MAC 1140.
1300,488758,Dorothy,Easley,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,great professor. answers all questions. offers lots of extra credit. just don't eat in class she hates that
1302,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045L,5.0,2.0,"One of, if not the best professor I've had. Understands the students point of view. Most of all he doesn't waste the classes time with unimportant information that isn't pertinent for exams. Honestly don't understand how he only has a 3/5, but its not at all indicative of my experience."
1303,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2210,1.0,4.0,"Professor Lawry is a great person. Hes inspirational. The problem with This Professor is that he is very unorganized and doesnt like to answer complicated questions. He did not follow his schedule and ended up cramming 3 chapters in 2 weeks, which made studying harder. I read the book and practiced everyday and still almost failed the final."
1304,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2210,1.0,5.0,"Lectures had nothing to do with test content . Most that studied and knew the content failed. Tests were poorly written, if you asked a question to clarify he would yell at you. Since he was so disorganized, he rushed a 3 chapter test into three lectures and sent the powerpoints for the chapters at 4PM the day before the exam. RUN"
1305,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2210,2.0,4.0,"Literally everything he claims and lectures will be on the test, IS NOT ON THE TEST! His tests are incredibly difficult compared to lectures. He rushes through chapters. he will cover a piece of the chapter and consider it done. Now I have no choice but to learn orgo 1 while taking orgo 2."
1306,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045L,4.0,3.0,"Best option out of all chem teachers. Can be very nice ,always participate. Find a group in class to help each other. However, always late, doesn't give back anything, and can be bipolar. Online he doesn't answer emails so use his office number on the syllabus. No pop quizzes, no tests, no midterm, or final. Grades come from pre-lab and lab."
1307,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045L,4.0,3.0,"happy to answer qs one moment,super angry the next-sometimes explains labs before really well, sometimes ur clueless-make sure u have people to talk with ab the lab-no exams-never hands back labs so u dk where u stand-in covid our grade consisted of ambiguously questioned lab quizzes-can call his office number to ask ab grades and qs-happy on phone"
1308,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2210,2.0,5.0,I heard several times from my classmates that they would go to his OH and he would be in rush somewhere and not give them the time. He does not go over exams or hand them back so you have no idea what you are lacking in. He did not adapt his class well to the online environment so I would not recommend taking him during this time.
1309,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1032,5.0,2.0,Its impossible not to get an A with so much extra credit. No homework or anything just do good on the tests and youre good.
1310,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1032L,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor. Show up to the lab, follow the procedure and as soon as you are done you can leave. He will explain everything that you need to know or dont understand. Best possible choice!"
1311,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2211,3.0,4.0,"Let me start by saying, the people who said his power points and reviews help on exams, lied. I took him for Orgo 1 and 2 and the only reason I did it a 2nd time is because he gives as much extra credit as humanly possible, so its virtually impossible to fail. You just wont learn anything. hes super nice and funny but lectures dont match exams."
1312,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2210,2.0,5.0,"Omg where do I begin..? Prof. Lawry was not only late to every class by roughly 15 minutes, he rushed through every lecture like the class knew the material. Secondly, every test is dramatically different compared to the notes and slides he goes over in class, and get this - he does NOT even hand back the tests, so you have no idea what you missed."
1313,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045L,4.0,4.0,"This teacher is kind and tries to make his students understand whats going on. But he seriously has no time for stupidity. He will snap. Pre labs and labs are due the week after the actual lab. I only got five of the 13 labs back, so i didnt know what my final grade was until the semester was officially over. No final, no tests. Just labs."
1314,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2211,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lawry teaches how Organic Chemistry is applied in life which makes it easier to understand. Also, if you are looking to take the MCAT he gives you hints that are helpful. His tests are hard but everything is in the book and his lectures."
1315,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHE2211,5.0,5.0,"Professor Lawry is an awesome teacher! There is no doubt that Organic Chemistry is difficult, but Professor Lawry does an amazing job at simplifying and teaching this topic. There is plenty of extra credit opportunities, and the test study guides are super helpful. This is THE PROFESSOR you want for Organic Chemistry!!!"
1316,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045L,5.0,3.0,"This guy is smart and cares about his students, but has no time for stupidity. Come to class prepared, listen to what he says, take notes, and do the work. You will be fine! I wish Prof. L taught more lectures because he has a way of communicating the material that makes it easy to understand."
1317,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045L,2.0,4.0,"There is no point of taking his class if you are actually going into medical field. He is not a good teacher and doesn't care about his students. HE DOES NOT ANSWER STUDENTS QUESTIONS. He is nice and all, but when you go to him with a question, he suddenly changes. I had to learn by myself."
1318,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1032L,3.0,3.0,he is kinda snappy at times and disorganized but as long as you read the procedures of the lab before you come into class you will be able to follow his instructions. no final and no assigned hw. doesn't give you graded work till the second to last class so your kinda aiming in the dark but the labs are relatively easy to follow and get done. 7/10
1319,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2210,1.0,4.0,Nice guy but very disorganized. Lecture slides not in sequence with the book. Gets off topic during lectures and wastes class time. Arrives late to class. Grading is not clear. Test material is a lot more complicated than examples covered in class. 4 tests are your only grades. Falls behind schedule and rushes through material and blames students.
1320,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1032,5.0,2.0,"If you aren't great at chem this is the guy for you! He knows exactly how to teach you to succeed in his class. He gives you a study guide before every test of the exact topic being asked for every question. Read the chapters and do some problems before class to know what is going on, do the study guide, do the extra credit and you will get an A."
1321,1015377,Joseph,Lawry,Broward College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2210,4.0,4.0,"Organic chemistry is very difficult, so you have to dedicate your time and Professor Lawry does try to help his students, but I will say his tests are stressful because they are like MCAT questions so it is very hard but he does try to help you as a student understand. Please attend all lectures if do you take him and ask questions."
1323,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM2211,1.0,5.0,"Completely trash professor, needs reform to learn how to teach online during the pandemic."
1324,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHM1020,3.0,3.0,"due to the pandemic, I had to do her class online. this is fine but she wouldn't teach she made us look at one hour and 15 videos before class, and during class, she would go over hw. she is super liberal right out tells us to vote not vote for Trump and vote for Biden"
1325,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHM2011,1.0,5.0,"I took her with all the intentions of doing well in her class, after her first exam she completely sucked the life out of her entire class. 80% of the class dropped, and the only person to pass her exam was a past student from org 1. if u have not taken org 1 with her RUN AWAY FAST!!!!!"
1326,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,BCH3033,4.0,4.0,"You definitely have to put in work for this class. She gives you about 2 lectures to watch before actual lecture (this was online, session 2, and during covid), and she works out problems for you during all of them. DO THEM! She gives you the opportunity to do homework for extra credit, DO IT! All 4 exams are pretty fair. Overall, good professor!"
1327,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM1032,5.0,4.0,"I took Chem1032 in a Session 2 course. Her syllabus is golden. If you follow that, and show up to the class, and study then its impossible to fail. She pre recorded lectures to watch before class and she goes over a group worksheet in the class. No textbook, just a lot of homework, quizzes, and 4 exams which includes the final. Shes awesome!"
1328,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM2211,4.0,5.0,"This is hard class so if you want to pass, you have to spend a lot of time reading, doing hws, and studying. She offers a lot of helpful resources and puts everything on D2L. She gives extra credit quizzes. Her exams are hard but if you study, you will do good. She does teach and curves grades. She helps if you need any help."
1329,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHM2211,1.0,5.0,"she is mean, her exams are insane. if you want to get a C in her class, you have to study day and night. She expects you to already know the materials. I will never take her again. Save yourself the headache and disappointment."
1330,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,BCH3033,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Choudhury was amazing for biochem! She's very caring and does her best to support us. She gives great extra credit. If I could redo it, I would attend all her lectures. They were very helpful for exams and I didn't realize that until later on. Ton of resources &amp; she is supportive of her students' future careers as well. Highly recommend!"
1331,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM1032,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER!!! She is very very forgetful. She talks very slowly and you'll get lost whenever she goes over a question. And whenever you ask a question, she explains something that has nothing to do with what you just asked. Her questions on her lab quizzes also aren't very clear either."
1332,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM1032,5.0,4.0,"I came into this class blinded having zero amount of background knowledge on chemistry, she makes it so do-able by posting the exact lecture notes from class and a video. 3 pop quizzes for extra credit, posts old exams similar to the ones you'll take. As long as you really study you'll get an A. I never thought I'd get a 99% in chem. Take her :)"
1333,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM1032,4.0,4.0,"I found this class VERY hard but its mostly because i dont understand chemistry very well, she records her lectures when we're in class which is good cause you can go back and rewatch something you didnt understand. She can be a bit strict sometimes but she will help you. You have to STUDY to pass this class."
1334,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM1032,5.0,2.0,She is BEST Chem1032 teachers take her corresponding lab too! I heard horror stories about the other teachers this semester! Records all her lectures so you can watch later and all homework and quizzes are extra credit. She gives a you all the tools to get an A people just think shes hard cause they dont want to bother trying or studying
1335,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHM2211,1.0,5.0,"She lectures like we already have a Ph.D. in chemistry and when you ask questions she acts like you should know it already. In a whole semester, I'm pretty sure I can count the number of times anyone has asked a question on both hands. She often asks the class questions and no one answers bc were all lost. Graded on 4 tests and that's it."
1336,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHEM2210,3.0,4.0,TO ANYONE WHO TAKES HER CLASS PLEASE RATE AFTER YOUR DONE!!!!
1337,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHM2211,1.0,5.0,"Being honest ... take another professor. Even wait another semester if you must. Unless you have 90s on her exams (which are impossible) she wont pay mind to you. Unapproachable and truly difficult to do well with her as a lecturer. Organic chemistry is hard as is, and she really doesnt make it any easier. Avoid avoid avoid."
1338,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,BCH3033,2.0,3.0,"All tests are handwritten, no multiple choice. She is only nice to you if you have an A in her class. Any grade lower and she can be rude and judgemental which I feel makes people not want to seek help in her office hours. I did well in her class but my friends struggled and I noticed the attitude she gave them versus me. Felt sorry for them."
1339,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,BCH3033,2.0,4.0,Biochemistry is a tough class. She makes it harder. Her tests were all free response and she takes off points if you don't say exactly what she wants in your answer. Don't ask generalized questions then expect students to answer specific!! I had to do a lot more studying than I felt I really needed to just to make it by. Take somewhere else.
1340,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHM1032,5.0,4.0,"I enjoyed her class very much!¡ a lot of people complained about the difficulty of it, but i think for it to be such a complex subject she made it very understandable. If you want to learn take her."
1341,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,BCH3033,5.0,4.0,Amazing professors. She has a lot of knowledge and I had her for Organic I and II as well as Biochemistry. The subject is extremely hard but she teaches in a way that allows you to really understand the content and retain information. I would strongly recommend her for those classes. You have to apply yourself to the class but it is extremely worth
1342,1194394,Laura,Choudhury,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,CHM1020,4.0,2.0,"pretty easy to pass; just apply yourself. Show up to class. All she does is lecture but if you pay attention then you should be good. She takes notes on the board that are easy to follow along, then she posts them on D2L after class so occasionally missing class should b ok. She posts practice tests on d2l that are very similar to the real test."
1344,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,5.0,Doesnt record class online so if your sick u fall behind to fast. If u dont understand math easy its confusing. Doesnt check email. Doesnt let you make up a test if your sick.

I asked him a simple question and his reply was""You were supposed to learn that in Highschool"" Like I've been out of school for ten years. Nasty as hell so Im between a low A or B. and that was pulling teeth. He needs to stop smacking while teaching"
1346,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,5.0,"Professor Paul has one of the most energetic teaching methods I have ever seen. Not only was the assignments difficult but they were persistent. Although, I was completely receptive to the topics of MAT1033, my ability to retain the knowledge was tested relentlessly. I commend Professor Paul on his work ethic and applaud him on his patience..."
1347,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,"He taught by using videos, barely teaching. I am really good at math and was failing all the tests. You're given classwork each class that you have about 20-30 minutes to finish. If you know the material you're good but if not, you can't take it home and study it. You also cant look back on tests to improve, and only have an hour to finish."
1348,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,If you don't care about your grades and your GPA good luck

1350,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,The first days of class i was nervous at first because this was my first teacher at bc and that being of a math class can be overwhelming. there was tons of work to do. but to be honest past the overwhenlming part of this class was one of the best college algibra classes ive had. ive taken all maths and physics in college and this guy gets it ....!
1351,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,1.0,"I took math up to calculus In highschool. Passed all with most As and a few Bs. Honestly this class was cake, really not suppose to be in it. I can see y many feel like he is difficult. His attitude is disrespectful &amp; he does make you feel slow. I wouldnt recommend him if youre horrible at math. Thankfully I was good at math! To each its own"
1352,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,4.0,"This teacher oh my gosh, if your bad at math please dont take him , he speeds through everything an doesn't like going over anything . He loud an makes you feel dumb when you ask for help. IF YOU'RE A MATH FREAk go ahead."
1353,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,If math is not your best subject don't take this class aleks assignments are assigned every week with a deadline that comes fast and have a lot of topics while every professor gives the student more down time to complete it

He plays videos, repeats what the video says and give you a paper with problems abt what you just saw and if u ask for help he'll give you a condescending remark. I went to the math lab and understood I applied it in class and he said it was wrong (which it wasn't) just bc I didn't follow his way."
1355,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,4.0,I struggled in his class and I'm usually good at math. I wouldn't recommend this professor
1356,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"Took in Spring 2017 at  N Campus, and had to drop. He grades the tests as if he were grading a paper written in ENC1101, literally takes off points for every little thing which if you score a 70 after all the deductions you'll walk away with a 50 or less. There is a quiz every class and an exam every other class. Take my advice and RUN"
1357,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,4.0,"Wonderful professor. His provided examples make it easier to understand the material. Write EVERYTHING he writes on the board in your notes. Definitions, examples, etc. Everything. Study that for the tests and you'll be golden. One of the best professors I have ever taken. Easy to pay attention as he is fully engaged and enthusiastic!"
1358,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,3.0,"Do NOT take his MAT1033 class. Be expected to teach yourself, his class consists of watching videos him repeating the videos and then a class work. If you do not understand the material do not dare ask him for clarification unless you want a condescending snarky remark. This professor made me uncomfortable on multiple occasions that I withdrew."
1359,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,5.0,"The majority of the information I learned in the class I taught to myself or got extra help on, especially since he just goes through videos and moves on to the next so quickly that it's hard to take notes. Daily graded assignments often don't relate to class vids. He even wrote the wrong grade(f) in D2l when I got an A. To be nice, he's energetic."
1360,641314,Paul,Beaulieu,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,Prof. Beaulieu is an amazing math professor. This is my second time taking statistics (first time with this prof.)

His tests are somewhat difficult so studying is a must if you want an A in the class. He wants you to do well so don't be afraid to ask for help. He also doesn't baby you so if you don't do your work don't be surprised if you end up with a C.
1380,769163,Walt,Jominy,Broward College (all campuses),Economics,BUS2353,5.0,3.0,"Professor Jominy's lectures are long, but he has funny stories that all relate back to Economics which makes it more bearable. He encourages people to ask questions and wants you to pass."

I always looked forward to this class. I would 10/10 recommend.
1442,1016070,Laura,Rambarose,Broward College (all campuses),Psychology,PSC2012,5.0,1.0,Just study hard easy A
1443,1016070,Laura,Rambarose,Broward College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"She is very passionate, which makes students eager to learn. And, only what's bolded need to memorize. She is hilarious and respected. If you want to pass your psy2012 with an easy A, choose that lady!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1444,1016070,Laura,Rambarose,Broward College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"Honestly I wish I could take her for every single class in college. She really is the best. Sweet and caring, she makes her lectures very real. Review before each test and extra credits opportunity. Take her, you won't regret!!"
1445,1016070,Laura,Rambarose,Broward College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"Rambarose is an awesome professor. I took her for a summer class and it went by really quickly but I understood a lot because she teaches well. A few papers to complete but easy to do. Print the powerpoints and follow along! Attend exam reviews the day before exams, they're really helpful. Extra credit opportunities and fun final project. TAKE HER!"
1446,1016070,Laura,Rambarose,Broward College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,Took her 6 wk summer course and it was awesome. She goes over everything that's will be on the test during her reviews and there's extra credit opportunity. Three tests and one Final project due after the class ends. There's no reason why you should fail this class. 13/10 would recommend
1447,1016070,Laura,Rambarose,Broward College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rambarose is honestly one of the best professors I have taken in Broward College. In her lectures she shows her Power Points, which are on d2l, and everything that is bolded will be on the test, so studying for the test is very simple. I recommend this class to anyone who wants a chill, funny teacher who is also an easy A."
1449,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,1.0,5.0,"Professor was the WORST math professor I have ever taken. Did not go over lessons properly, rushed and crammed multiple lessons, quizzes/homework/exams had completely different questions than what he taught. Did not care that 98% of the class was failing exams. Expected us to take hours doing extra work and blamed us for not doing enough."
1450,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,2.0,He is a good professor and he cares about if you are getting everything or not. He gives extra credit if he sees that you are making an effort to understand. Just meet all of the due dates and you will be good
1451,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,3.0,I've taken multiple classes with him before and he truly does care about his students. If you follow everything that needs to be youll be fine. Do the homework! Do everything on time and you get a good grade. Calculus is not an easy class and more than half of the people that will be in this class are STEM Major. If you cant handle it then drop it.
1452,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,1.0,4.0,"This guy is completely not helpful. He is a strict and stern professor and you cant get him to change his mind on anything. It hurts because he has a high rating but trust me that was the old him. The New Him, does curve nor give extra credit and gives an absorb amount of quiz questions. ALL TEST ARE ON HONORLOCK, SO CHOOSE TO TAKE HIM, GOOD LUCK."
1453,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,5.0,3.0,He is AMAZING! He really cares for students to pass the class and doesn't mind going over the topic 100 times until everyone gets it. Definitely the best math professor at BC.
1454,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,4.0,I took this professor for Business Calculus and was surprised how woefully unprepared and defensive he was. His syllabus either had incorrect due dates for quizzes or didn't even list them period. And when asked about the errors he gets extremely defensive and tries to make it seem like it was your fault for trusting in the syllabus that he created
1455,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,4.0,"This is the first online math class I've taken at Broward College. I had the pleasure of having Dr. Ibrahim as my professor. He responds fairly quickly, gives feedback when needed while maintaining a professional attitude the whole time. His english isn't the best, which does make it a bit hard to communicate at times, but good professor overall."
1456,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,3.0,"Good professor, I took trig with him during COVID. We had 4 assignments, homework on mymathlab, 5 test, 1 midterm &amp; 1 final. Non-proctored exams and must attend lectures. He rants a lot but he is a good teacher and he will stop and make sure you understand. Heavy accent but it isn't too bad. Strict on due dates. Taking him again for mac1140"
1457,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"Professor Abushieba is the best math professor I have ever had, I don't understand how there can be bad comments for him, he is a person who cares that his students have a good grade, he gives infinite opportunities to pass his class, and also educates us to be a better person."
1458,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,2.0,"He is amazing! He repeats everything and tries to make sure everyone understands. He doesn't mind going over the same thing a thousand times until you get it. He gives the class at a slow pace. He has some accent, but you get used to it pretty quickly. SUPER NICE! TONS OF EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITY! GIVES A PRACTICE TEST AS EXTRA CREDIT!"
1459,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,1.0,5.0,There were easily close to 100 questions in each hw assignment and being able to spend hours in the lab after the class is a necessary to pass. The tests were hard and half the stuff in the review wasn't even on the test.
1460,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,2.0,4.0,I took this prof during the corona outbreak and whether the class was online or in person this professor complains for at least 30 minutes every class about the students. He takes attendance at the end of class. Test were multiple choice in person but were switched to MyMathLab when the class went online. He is very much a high-school like teacher.
1461,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,4.0,4.0,"The most dedicated and passionate professor you'll encounter. He is really good at teaching and does not mind having an issue hearing your questions. Although you do need to earn your grade and work for it, that's with all professors in college. Take notes, ask questions, do all homework, and you'll receive a passing grade no matter what."
1462,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"This professor is very nice and professional. He likes to make sure his students know the requirements in the class, and helps you as much as he can. He also makes time for his students outside of the classroom, as he also was quick to answer emails."
1463,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"He's the best math professor I've had. He is VERY clear in what he's expecting of you and when the work is due. The homework, quizzes and extra credit are all unlimited attempts so you can make sure you get an A on them. He also goes over everything and makes sure you understand it before he moves on. Def. take notes."
1464,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1200,1.0,5.0,Very Difficult! One of the hardest classes I ever took and he gives ALOT of homework I would find someone else!
1465,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1200,1.0,5.0,VERY Hard I was not happy with my grade this is a VERY difficult class I will pass the next time I take it.
1466,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Ibrahim gives an insane amount of easy-to-earn extra credit, teaches calculus in a very clear and accessible way, has a great personality, gives amazing lectures, is hilarious, makes the hardest concepts seem easy, is easily accessible outside of class, and is very passionate about all of his students doing well. You will not regret taking him."
1467,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,2.0,"By far one of the best teachers I've had at Broward. Teaches very well and makes sure that you know the material. There's a lot of homework on Pearson MyLab, but if you keep to a schedule you should be fine. Sign in the computer labs often- if he sees you've been working there and you're close to the next letter grade, he'll raise it. Very kind!"
1468,1025106,Abushieba,Ibrahim,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"His class wasn't hard, since the tests were exactly like the reviews from Aleks and the program is great at teaching. Additionally, his lectures were really engaging and he would mostly teach the basics of what you needed to know. Simply put, the class should be easy to pass if you stay on track with your work and do your topics on time."
1470,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sabau is great, he explains everything and gives you examples of how to do the homework, so you will understand how to do it on your own. He responds to you in time and assists you with anything that you do not understands. Great Professor takes him if you want to understand Math better."
1471,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HIM!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR DECISION. I HATE Math and was never good at at. I was dreading to take Stats and was so scared. Do your assignments and HW and you will pass! He answers your emails on time and he even will answer txts. You even get extra credit for each test! If you fail, that is on you. He really cares about his students!"
1472,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,Such an amazing professor! I loved his class. If you do the work you will pass. The N-I-C-E-S-T PROFESSOR
1473,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,He is an amazinggggggggggggg professor! math is NOT my subject however he made it easy for me... he will go over problems with you and will go over it until you get it. He offers a lot of extra credit.. there is a lot of homework but its manageable. TAKE HIM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! seriously lol do it...
1474,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,Math is never my subject but he makes it completely understandable. Huge plus his lectures are all recorded so you can always go back.
1475,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,4.0,"Math is not by best subject at all. However he is THE best teacher that i have taken in years. He allows you to understand and explains so that you can move forward. Such an amazing professor, especially during a pandemic. Lots of extra credit. If you fail its because you didn't try."
1476,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,2.0,"This class is an easy A. Professor Sabau does everything he can to make sure you understand and get a good grade. All you have to do for this class is show up, pay attention, and do the homework assignments. I would so take this class again. He made Stats easy. He is a very caring and understanding professor."
1477,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,2.0,Professor Sabau is great and made Stats easy. I suck with Math and our class was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which switched our on-campus learning experience online in the middle of the semester. The transition was seamless and I passed with an A. I highly recommend Professor Sabau.
1478,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1106,5.0,1.0,"I really enjoyed taking Prof Sabau. Hes caring and understanding. Takes his time explaining, and funny at times. I genuinely enjoyed taking him and I highly recommend him, I had a blended class but he really is a great teacher you wont be disappointed, he gives a lot of extra credit and helps you with deadlines."
1479,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,This man is the best! His class was an easy A. Had to buy mystat lab where hw quizzes and test were taken. Study a little for his test and you will be fine. Everything is solved on a calculator.
1480,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,1.0,I dont usually do this but this guy is just too soft spoken to be a professor. You can hardly hear anything he says.
1481,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,I think he is good professor but I didnt like the way he taught statistics compared to my sta1001 professor but overall you will learn. He will drop your 5 lowest quizzes and gives you a lot of extra credit. Its really important to know the formulas because you won't be allowed to bring anything in the testing center except your calculator.
1482,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,4.0,2.0,"Took Prof. Sabau for Fundamentals of Math. Reasoning and his class was a breeze. Attendance is not mandatory but if you skip, you may miss out on a lot of important info. He gives a lot of extra credit opportunities ."
1483,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,1.0,"Professor Sabau is the best. He understand and he is a great listener. I truly enjoyed his class. I took him for intermediate algebra and statistics. Im planning on taking him for college algebra. After not being in school for 20 years, I was very scared to take math. I was truly blessed to be in Professor Sabau's class. Easy A."
1484,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,4.0,3.0,"Most of the work is done on MyMathLab. He does the homework in class after the lecture, to show specific problems and has you write it down as examples. I didn't go to class much and learned most of it from MyMathLab. His tests were short and pretty easy. He also allowed for us to complete any work after due date, at the end of semester on Mathlab"
1485,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1107,5.0,2.0,"He gives you so many opportunities for extra credit &amp; drops 5 lowest quiz grades &amp; 1 exam grade- as long as you do your work, youre guaranteed an A. Professor Sabau is really nice &amp; wants his students to do well. I would definitely take him again."
1486,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Sabau was hands down the best teacher, he would remove questions from the HW on Pearson and give 18 questions MAX. Extra credit prior to taking exams with unlimited tries to get 100%. His tests are taken in the math lab. Extra credit at the end of the semester for taking notes. Reviews HW in class. Easy A."
1487,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,This professor is hands down a very mellow person and it honestly makes the course easier to understand in my opinion. He takes his time and gives different ways to solve problems. He also provides extra credit opportunities and the homework does count as a grade. His exams are in class as well as online and it definitely helps to participate!
1488,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,3.0,"I dont understand, i pass my test and final exam and did all the extra credits and and my homeworks got As and Bs because of not passing 1 test i fail the whole class. He wouldnt even try to understand and straight up gave me whatever he wanted."
1489,9941,Cristian,Sabau,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,2.0,"Professor Sabau is Very Caring, I took him for liberal arts over the summer. Great Lectures, He gives extra credit, and the homework counts toward your grade, You have to buy the code for Mymathlab so you dont need the book, If the class ask he will make the test online test. I got and 87 in the class without taking the final."
1491,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"I never write these things but i had to for this prof. BEST PROF i have ever taken in BC !! Lectures are clear, pay attention to the lectures &amp; copy down some notes &amp; you would be fine. He gives a study guide review that is EXACTLY what it is on the test. He gives homework after each lecture but it isn't mandatory. HIGHLY RECOMMEND !"
1492,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,4.0,"L O V E!!! Easily one the best prof Ive ever had. He teaches math in such a clear way and he makes learning new topics sooo easy! His reviews/study guides are EXACTLY like the exams. As long as you study and complete a good portion of ALEKS, youll pass with nothing less than a B! Hes hilarious and truly cares for his students! Take him ASAP!!!"
1493,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"He honestly is the best professor. Clear, well spoken lectures, just pay attention and try to come to every class as in math you fall behind. practice quiz for each chapter test is pretty much a replica just study that and you will succeed."
1494,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Professor Mourad class was very simple so was his outline. You show up to class, pay attention, ask for feedback on questions, study and the test are easy. I would take again. Very ""to the point kind of professor"". Cares about his students passing."
1495,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"Best math prof. at BC. H/W not mandatory but it really helps you get better at your math. He gives practice tests that are similar to the actual tests; no surprises. He drops the lowest grade and let you make up a test if you get less than 70 percent. I would take him again in a heartbeat! Wants everyone to pass, very caring. Amazing!..."
1496,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,I suckkkkk at math to the point where I was terrified to take this class or start my other math classes for that matter. But this professor made me understand so much that it makes me emotional. He teaches where a baby can understand. I passed the class with an B and I've gotten nothing but D's in the past. This guy is the best!!!
1497,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,5.0,"I found his ratings to be a bit misleading, he barely taught the class the content of MAT1033, he was very condescending when you asked for help as he makes it seem that this is criteria we should already know. Professor, if we understood intermediate algebra, we would not be taking this prerequisite that doesn't even go towards our GPA.."
1498,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"Seriously good teacher, never makes you feel bad about asking questions and his classes are structured so that you can actually learn. He teaches the lesson for the day and then gives you problems to work on during class and you go up and check them with him to leave. If you get anything wrong he'll help you figure it out till you know the material"
1499,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"Angel I am worst at math I am in love with math because of this God of a professor Superb ,Kind,genuine cares for his students to excel LOVE him"
1500,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,TAKE HIM. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
1501,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Im honestly pretty trash at math and Mr. Mourad simplified everything and taught his lessons in a way that even i got. Also its pretty cool how whenever he checks your work instead of just saying you got thus problem wrong, he shows you exactly why you got it wrong and shows you step by step how the problem should be done."
1502,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,4.0,"Well, he is a good professor and is very clear about his grading criteria. Very nice and gives second chances. It was a tough class, but he was very helpful."
1503,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA1001,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, he stayed back with me and a few other students to go over some homework. He also grades on a sliding scale I hate math so he was very helpful and really nice will go over work with you and explain"
1504,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,4.0,"great professor, teaches very well and gives second chances !"
1505,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,Very nice professor. I wish he taught every math class my GPA would be a 5.0 if he did. somehow taught extremely well and managed to get an A in math which is unheard of for me. He goes slow and really makes sure you understand. He has ALeks homework but tests the only annoying part. Its worth it. Take his class!!
1506,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Take this mans. Im absolutely garbage at math and i passed his class easy. Very very laid back and reasonable, but also a good teacher. He knows his stuff and if u dont understand hell explain it as many times as it takes. If you make sure you understand the reviews youll definitely pass his tests (usually no more than 20 questions)."
1507,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,2.0,Prof Mourad is great. He is patient and will help you if you need individual assistance. He does not give a lot of work and if you pay attention you will pass.
1508,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,I hate math with a passion and professor Mourad is an amazing teacher he knows his stuff and really helps you understand the material I normally don't leave reviews but this had to be done pick him you will not regret it...
1509,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,Best math teacher ever!!! Take him and you won't regret. Easy A . He is going to teach Statistics and College algebra too.
1510,604600,Bahaa,Mourad,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Math has essentially always been a difficult subject for me. Entering Professor Mourad's class is like cleansing my mind of all uncertainty and just follow exactly what he says. He asks for you to pay attention to his explanation instead of trying to write down everything. And boy, has he changed my perspective on math entirely! BEST PROF EVER! 3"
1512,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCG2071,5.0,3.0,"ive had Ms. B, 3 Courses now, &amp; I can honestly say, as a self employed business owner of 10 years, it was very hard for me in the beginning of this class. I had to unlearn &amp; relearn the theoretical way. Ms. B has a way of truly caring about her students and listening to your questions &amp; finding the answers w/ you. Also Akeem is an amazing tutor."
1513,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ECO2023,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher. She is very understanding and cares a lot about her subject.

1514,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCG2071,5.0,3.0,Dr. B is an Amazing professor who cares about her students. If your struggling in her class she goes out her way to help you by either staying with you after class if she has time to spare or shell email you different resources to help you. By far she one of the best and well respected professors. Your truly lucky if you can get into her class.
1515,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2071,5.0,1.0,"Super Awesome and Super Easy. I took her for Accounting 1,2,&amp;3 and your grade is only based on Cengage; no D2L. However, I'm also taking her for Microeconomics where we have to use D2L and I also have an A in that class as well and even though we have to use D2L for that class it's only discussions and quizzes and the discussion are great topics."
1516,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCG2071,5.0,3.0,I took Dr. B for several accounting classes.

1520,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACG2000,5.0,4.0,Her wit and charisma makes the time go fast and somehow drills all the needed information in your head. She's an amazing teacher who LITERALLY goes above and beyond for her students.

Thank you, Dr. Bently, for being a teacher and for your passion"
1522,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ECO2013,5.0,2.0,Dr. Bentley was a fantastic professor and made macroeconomics more digestible to comprehend. She was a positive and lively person that made learning fun. Dr. Bentley also gave wonderful life advice and she knows her students.
1523,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCG2071,4.0,3.0,Dr. B is amazing! She makes learning accounting easy. If you dont understand something she will make sure you do. I reached out to her outside of class for help on the homework and she immediately responded within minutes ... I will definitely take her for accounting 2 and 3 for spring semester. She is awesome!
1524,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC202,5.0,1.0,"The best professor ever , she is always there if you. Need her , so far one of my best professors"
1525,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2001,5.0,3.0,"All the work is done at home on Cengage. No tests or in class work. She tries to make sure everyone understands the lectures, if not she will teach until you understand. If you have a question she stays after class."
1526,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACG2071,5.0,3.0,"Prof. B. is fantastic. I took her for all 3 accounting classes. Accounting is not easy, and cengage (the website that you will be doing your homework and tests) is not great. Prof. B. was able to work around the system's flaws and be there for us. Kudos for Prof. B. for always doing her best, and to always have such a great attitude!"
1527,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACG2011,5.0,2.0,"Bentley is an exceptional professor. I was pursuing a degree in Marketing, but once I enrolled into her class she inspired me to become a CPA. Cengage can be tedious, but with any accounting professor in BC you're going to use the program anyways. She is hilarious and will make the class as painless as possible. If you're smart you will take her."
1528,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACG1001,4.0,4.0,"I took ACG2001 with Professor Bentley and she (almost) inspired me to switch to an accounting major. In class, she really gives details on how to use accounting in real life. The class was a blended course with all of the online work due in Cengage. The best way to pass is to pace yourself and try to do an assignment or two a day. Good luck!"
1529,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCG2071,5.0,1.0,"Amazing teacher.  If you have difficulties in learning accounting - TAKE HER! She explains in details, she is well prepared for every class and she really loves her students.  I took her for account II and III between my pregnancy and having my baby - she was very understanding.  I got B+ on both classes.  Prof. Bently is an excellent teacher!"
1530,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACG2011,5.0,2.0,"This professor is simply amazing! I never thought I could have a professor like this for accounting. She is the best, her lectures are very interesting , you really learn. I took her for summer class , it was only six weeks but I learned a lot."
1531,1184305,Patricia,Bentley,Broward College (all campuses),Accounting,ACG2011,5.0,2.0,"Professor B is the BEST accounting professor I have had. I came from oI have learned a lot in her 8 week blended class. She cares so much about your grade that you can take your exams and assignments TWICE if you need to better your grade.  I found out that she has a ACG2071 class, and I redid my ED plan, to take that course."
1533,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,1.0,5.0,"Very hard to understand, does not give feedback clearly, is off topic always, refuses to record class lectures, unreasonable, unstructured, no lesson plan, does not give examples, overall would not recommend for first time college students!!!!!!! usually only 1 out of 23 students will be able to figure out his writing style."
1534,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,2.0,4.0,He is a great professor if you are into old literature. But sometimes he can be rude toward students who disagree with his opinion or the point of view of the books that are require for his 1101 class . He is very hard to understand in every lecture.
1535,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,3.0,3.0,"Very boring class, assigns 3 books to read. He is a very sweet professor but he has trouble keeping the class engaged and interested in what he teaches."
1536,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,3.0,4.0,This is one professor that will make you WORK for your grade. I passed with a C and honestly I couldn't be happier. We had 3 essays in total and I struggled with 2 and he's so nice he actually made time for me to retake them. He's really sweet and will work with you but doesn't make what he wants clear and answers your question with a question.
1537,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,4.0,2.0,"Very kind professor. He speaks a lot but is nice and willing to help if you need it. Essay's aren't too hard if you read the instructions carefully. Class consists of a total of 5 assignments, so you have to really do well on all of them to get a good grade. He is very lenient and understanding."
1538,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,2.0,5.0,One of the nicest prof but also one of the worst Wud talk for the whole class about nothing.U will not learn a thing but make sure u do ur best on the few assignments and papers he gives out.I'm a str8 A student and he gave me my only B that i ever received and i was lucky to get that by getting an 80 bcuz i did okay on the final paper. DONT TAKE!!
1539,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,3.0,4.0,Sometimes it will be had to get straightforward answers.
1540,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,1.0,4.0,"He means well but I didn't learn a thing in his class. Very tough grader and has no clear teaching style. When he ""lectures"" its really just him going off on a long tangent about something that doesn't make sense. He will start off talking about the book &amp; end up ranting on politics. On the plus side, no HW &amp; hardly any classwork the whole semester"
1541,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Feaster class at first seemed hard, as it was based on The Essays Of Emerson. It was confusing for me at first because I am not into philosophy/ Shakespeare. Once you speak with the teacher and provide your concerns, you will be fine. No mandatory labs, no online homework, three papers due which does not have to be lengthy."
1542,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,3.0,3.0,"I did not understand well the purpose of the class, I was supposed to learn to write essays at a college level, but all we did was read pieces of two books and listen to rap songs by Eminem. His classes were very boring and confusing."
1543,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,4.0,3.0,"He is very friendly and will go above and beyond to help his students IF you seek his help. He is not a tough grader, but he will make you earn your grade. If you're looking for an easy A then he's not the professor for you. Professor Scott encourages you to think outside the box and work on your weak areas as a writer."
1544,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,3.0,3.0,Loved his class. The book he uses is interesting and will make you think. The papers for his class are a page at the most. Tough grader so your paper will need real deep thought and meaning.
1545,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,2.0,4.0,He Helps if needed but kinda hard to understand in my opinion. He is understanding for somethings but not all.
1546,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,"This professor was life changing to me. He inspired me to read, write and think about what life is truly about. He thought my class about personality types and how to use it as a tool to find the author in you. If you make the effort and visit him during his office hours, you will find out he will go any lengths to help you."
1547,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,4.0,1.0,This is a easy class to pass. Make sure you listen carefully to what he is saying and you will be fine.
1548,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"This professor isn't for everyone. If you're interested or good in English  I would highly recommend him. To me, the class was pretty easy. Only 2 short papers and one final paper. The class was based around The Essays of Robert Emerson who's a more philisophical figurative kind of writer. Very nice and helpful."
1549,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,"OMG I took him for my ENC1102 and this is the worst professor I've ever had... You really don't know what he's asking for in the papers... Worst professor ever, if you can to drop your GPA take this class seriously...."
1550,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,3.0,4.0,I walk in ENC1101 and the syllabus only said 3 papers and I was going to drop it before I made a C+ on my first paper. His grading is based on what he thinks so be ready to fight for a better grade on what you received. It is not easy to make an A in his class you must work for it and do it the way he wants you to do it. Easy C or B for his class.
1551,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,2.0,4.0,Does not teach very much. I don't really know what I learned in this class. You need to take initiative and go to his office for advice on your papers if you want to get anywhere near a C or B. His grading policies and rubrics are pretty ambiguous and somewhat unfair.
1552,248347,Scott,Feaster,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,4.0,4.0,"If you want an A on your papers you have to go to him during his office hours, he is very picky on what he wants and grades hard. This class is not an Easy A"
1554,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY2054,3.0,3.0,Pros/Cons -Exams are the essentially the homework (except for 1 question on the 3rd exam) -Good sense of humor/hilarious stories -Laid-back dude/very intelligent (he undersells his intelligence) -You're screwed if you miss a part of a question -Only graded via tests -Parts of questions on test are not weighted equally Would take again if possible
1555,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1003,5.0,3.0,"What a great class! Great guy. Very casual and easy-going which made it comfortable for everyone in class to ask a lot of questions. He knows Astronomy like no one else. Provides multiple opportunities to earn extra credit, like Field Trips &amp; Volunteer work. He's strick on attendance. I definitely recommend him!!!"
1556,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY2054,5.0,4.0,"THANK YOU Professor Mulchan for a great semester! Your class was truly an inspiration. I'm now officially done at Broward College and off to Georgia Tech. You were by far the best Professor I had at Broward. You fostered a calm, relaxed classroom atmosphere and always made yourself readily available the many times I needed help with the material."
1557,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY2049,5.0,4.0,"Challenging material but learnt A LOT! Not an easy class, but that tends to happen when you take Physics with Calculus! He does many worked examples in class so that helps with the application of the lecture material. He's also got a great sense of humor and is well travelled to all 7 Continents so that makes for some very entertaining stories!"
1558,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,5.0,1.0,"You will leave his class questioning life. There are 3 tests, all open notes. He is tough on attendance, if you walk in 5 seconds after he called your name you will be marked absent. He takes points off for each absence so if you are late often do not take this class. other than attendance this class is an easy A"
1559,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY2048,5.0,5.0,"Wants you to improve and If he sees that you are putting long hours of studying you will pass. Physics is not a easy subject. This class changed my life.  Also, You will see at the beginning how difficult this class is but try your hardest to not drop out."
1560,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1003,4.0,4.0,"professor Neil is great and very knowledgeable with Astronomy. I learned many knew things with him. He is tough on attendance, no cell phone visible and class participation. Professor Neil is very approachable, but be sure to ask a clear question. Great class!!"
1561,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,5.0,2.0,Prof. Neil is one of kind. He's awesome and really makes you think about the world around you. I definitely recommend him! Take his class!
1562,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,5.0,2.0,"Neil is an amazing professor , he is so smart and full of passion every lesson. His lectures are captivating, just make sure you take careful notes because he lets you use them on tests. There are only 3 tests all semester so you cant mess them up . He doesn' require the purchase of a book which is great. If you get the chance to take him do it !"
1563,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1001,4.0,3.0,"Neil is a very interesting professor, his lectures are very inspirational and come straight from his mind. The only thing I did not like about this class is you don't have much opportunity for grades. Just 3 exams and thats it, and the extra credits are not really worth much. The class is fairly easy just show up and don't miss the exams."
1564,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,4.0,2.0,"to continue on.. you will walk out of his class questioning ""life"" and everything that you learned that day. ONLY 3 EXAMS, 50?s, multiple choice!! He really made it easy for his students! NO TEXTBOOK PURCHASE REQUIRED!! all he asks for in return is for your attention and respect. Take him, you won't regret it at all."
1565,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,5.0,2.0,"His lectures are forever life changing! He is amazing!! NO homework; Already has a study guide ready for you-- THAT'S ALL you need. His lectures are beyond interesting! he doesn't lecture like a ""normal"" prof. He puts up a photo on the screen and basically talks about it- Almost like having a conversation with you! Definitely must write notes!!!"
1566,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,5.0,1.0,"Fantastic class! Multiple choice exams, no final, and a great professor! He's very energetic, and gives amazingly interesting lectures! Highly recommended!"
1567,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,3.0,4.0,Interesting class but exams are tough. He has a  monotone voice. He doesn't except tardiness and will mark you absent if you come in late. Gives you a packet but it's not the exact same information he ask you on the test. Doesn't curve grades. No homework. No textbook to study your own information. Hes overall a straight teacher and so is the class
1568,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY2049,5.0,4.0,"What an amazing Professor! Extremely knowledgeable and dedicated to his profession. This was the most challenging class I've ever taken, but the pay off was how much new knowledge I've gained. I've lost a lot of sleep, but that's why I'm here! I highly recommend Dr. Mulchan if you want to learn anything and are willing to work for it."
1569,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1002,5.0,3.0,His lectures are amazing! He has a way of ending the class that leaves you mind blown. His lectures go into a lot of depth &amp; u should take extensive notes. Don't miss class. The books are open notes/book though I don't recommend buying the book you don't need it for anything else. There's 1 presentation and 3 exams. Extra credit community service.
1570,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY1001,4.5,3.0,Great class. Awesome professor. Highly recommended.
1571,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY1001,3.0,5.0,"Great for astronomy but physics, not so sure! I nearly fail this class, and I gave it all. I have never taken physics in my life, so I guess if you already have some knowledge then you will be in better position. I would recommend someone else for first timers."
1572,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,AST1003,4.5,2.0,Neil (not prof mulchan) is great! Lectures are inquisitive and inspiring. He shares life experience to bring subjects to light. He is attractive but very professional when people can be annoying and go off task. Tests are open note open book but you don't need the book. I'm looking to take him for physics although I hear he is MUCH harder.
1573,509609,Neil,Mulchan,Broward College (all campuses),Natural Sciences,PHY1001,4.5,3.0,"Professor Neil is incredible! He encourages you to see the world and learn from it. Physics is not easy, but he tries to teach you and use examples of real life to make you understand. Tests are hard.  I completely fall in love with him; he inspires the students.  If you study, you will pas.."
1575,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2313,1.0,3.0,"terrible lecture notes, barely covers the concepts that are given for tests and homework. If you're going to take his class be prepared to teach yourself the majority of the material."
1576,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,4.0,3.0,"He lectures quite fast in class, but if you ask him to redo or re-explain a topic/question he will do it without hesitation. The tests were very fair, and the homework wasn't mandatory, but I recommend doing it. We had 4 tests (he dropped the lowest grade) and a final. The final was significantly more difficult compared to the tests, but I passed."
1577,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2313,4.0,3.0,"Professor Geraci is very fair. His lectures are good and the tests are easy. As long as you show up to class, pay attention and do practice problems from the homework, you will pass."
1578,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,4.0,3.0,"Dr Geraci is a great professor that will help students who pay attention and show some interest. This course is not easy, so you must do the homework he assigns in every section to have a better understanding. He is very passionate and a fair grader. Pay attention and homework are the key of success this challenging course."

1582,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2313,5.0,4.0,"I would definitely recommend this professor if you really want to learn. Je is not easy, but explains everything well and has the best lectures of any math professor I have taken. When we went remote ( due to virus), his lectures were the same quality. I even tried watching the videos in web assign but his lectures were much better!"
1583,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,"Do yourself a favor and DON'T TAKE HIM. I had to DROP from his class because he was a horrible teacher. Super messy handwriting, rude, and messes up on problems all the time. There are only 4 tests and drops the lowest grade and a final. Don't take his class. I had to retake the class with a new teacher and she was phenomenal and I got an A."
1584,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,"If you're reading this DO NOT TAKE HIM. Do not believe the good reviews. Talks WAY too fast, messy handwriting, messes up A LOT, and rude. When writing notes, he explains something and then says ""You DON'T want to do it this way"". Like what? I basically had to teach myself everything. 4 tests and a cumulative final. Drops your lowest test grade."
1585,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,5.0,4.0,Geraci is a good teacher. He will help you if you go to him for extra help. You can tell he really cares about his students. He really knows his stuff. Don't skip class or you will not do well.
1586,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,The worse Professor EVER!!!! NEVER TAKE HIM iF YOU WNAT TO PASS A MATH CLASS. He doesn't explain the teaching and he starts to write very fast and you don't even know what he is doing and at the end of the class you still don't get nothing of all the section.
1587,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,1.0,5.0,"I dont recommend him if you struggle with math usually. He lectures extremely fast&amp;has terrible handwriting. The notes he writes on the board are extremely unorganized&amp;hard to follow. You end up teaching yourself the entire lessons after each class. He also hates any sort of technology, keep phonestops out of his class. 1st class I had to drop"
1588,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,3.0,"Awsome professor. Never understood it the first time. His lectures are amazing. Dont miss class. You can tell he loves what he does. Dont take pictures of the board, he will go off on you."
1589,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,Hes a great teacher that really cares about his students. He drops the lowest of your 3 test grades and the final weighs less than the two other tests. He doesnt take attendance but I wouldnt recommend missing any classes. This was the only math class ive ever passed in college without having to retake the class.
1590,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"This professor is great. I don't like math but he really made it easy to understand. Grade only based on tests and he drop the lowest. He help me in the office too when I need it. Final exam was hard, but he review everything. I am take him again if I can!"
1591,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,3.0,4.0,"Dont go into this if you will skip a lot, your grade is based on 5 test, though one Is dropped. Their is A LOT of material to be covered and its fast. He gives partial credit which is good, and his teaching is good. The final is multiple choice and he doe curve a bit on the tests. Highly recommend doing all your homework and the chapter review."
1592,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,4.0,"If you like a fast paste professor this is your class to take. I took his class and he explains very fast, he often does mistakes on some math problems, does not answer your question, and he does not come prepared to class. This is a math class if you are very fast paste."
1593,360825,Sanford,Geraci,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0057,4.0,3.0,Had him for developmental math. Hes very understanding and will help you out if you dont understand. Finally getting to pass this math to get back on track. I appreciate him a lot. As long as you do youre work youre good.

1596,1213842,Joshua,Kimber,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"Loved him. He really got us thinking and he LOVES what he does. He is very passionate and made us really question the way we think and the foundations of what we believe. He works with students, and takes late work."
1597,1213842,Joshua,Kimber,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,2.0,"Professor Kimber is awesome! Get ready to do assignments because its ALOT!!!!!! 7 HWs, midterm take-home, final take-home, group project, writing activity, &amp; 7 mini-quizzes. The homework takes most of your time and you'll feel discourage and start to procrastinate but its worth it in the end because the homework is worth 50% of your overall grade."
1598,1213842,Joshua,Kimber,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kimber was amazing and so sweet he does give quite a bit of homework but he gives you good feedback on the grades he gives. The lectures are interesting a gets everyone engaged. I'm so sad that this semester and our time with him is over. If i get the chance to have him as a lecturer again, I'm taking it in a heartbeat!"
1599,1213842,Joshua,Kimber,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,He does require a lot of reading because he will like you to read ahead to take a pop quiz so you can understand the lectures a little better. I like how he engage all of his students to make learning fun. He really did tried his best to make sure we learn and pass.
1600,1213842,Joshua,Kimber,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,"How this professor doesn't have 100% is beyond me. This prof is THE BEST. Hands down. You have to read a lot in philosophy, it's just the nature of the beast, but really it is enjoyable work and easy. There's lots of homeowrk, but hardly any tests/quizs. No heavy exams. The class is more about exploring philosophy rather than the technicalities."

Though he is most definitely an intellectual, his course was unpleasant to complete. This isn't a complaining review about how the work was too hard. I completed all assignments, received an A on final paper, and more than 100% on mid-term. The weekly packets were miserable to complete"
1608,1213842,Joshua,Kimber,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,1.0,"Great professor! Funny, lets you turn in work late if you need to, gives lots of extra credit.

He is very kind and gives a lot of extra credit. BUT he does give a lot of HW, and long lectures. The HW is a good 2-3 pages long, and theyre easy to do if you show up to class regularly. His quizzes and mid term/ final are an EASY A."

1614,1213842,Joshua,Kimber,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,4.0,4.0,Really Really nice Teacher but be aware of the quiz you have one in each class. So there a quiz online and in class. The homework is extremely long and annoying but easy. You need the book to answer them but I recommend you buying a use one online for $10.

Daily quizzes but open notes, often based on an exercise from previous lecture. If you put in some effort, you'll pass. Took him for Calc 2 &amp; 3 and Diff Equations. Level of knowledge is unmatched. You have to choose not to understand"
1618,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2313,5.0,1.0,"Literally one of the best professors ever. He explains everything so well, making hard concepts seem simple.

1619,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,2.0,Most math classes have you sit through a 2 hour lecture that leaves you confused and you end up watching a 10 minute youtube video that explains the material better. This man is that 10 minute youtube video. Straight to the point and all the steps to help you learn. He gives you proper examples that can help you complete the course work.
1620,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,2.0,"Professor Spector is a LEGEND! Save yourself the reading and sign up for his class. NOW! Still reading this?

Had to take him during corona, so it was remote learning thru blackboard. I was so glad I took his class during these crazy times because it did not add any stress to my life. You just listen to his lecture and then he emails the assignment for the day which will take you 30 minutes max to complete."

1626,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,3.0,No graded homework. We had daily one point quizzes which were more for him to know that we aren't behind. This professor is PHENOMENAL at teaching. He tells you what will be on the test and if you practice the homework questions before the tests you'll pass. 10/10.
1627,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"I was afraid of College Algebra. I failed once and withdrew the second time with other professors.

Do your work, try your hardest and you will Pass."

1629,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,2.0,Spector is a great professor. Took him for Calc 2 and Diff. Eq. You will not regret it. He explains things in the easiest way possible. He does HW problems as his lecture so you end up with little HW. He does get annoyed easily if students aren't paying attention. Most classes were less than an hour. Take him if you can.
1630,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2223,5.0,3.0,Amazing lectures!

1634,345845,Ira,Spector,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2313,5.0,3.0,I took professor Spector for cal 2 and cal 3 and he makes calculus easy to understand. He only require 2 things from you one is do not talk in class and have your notebook out before he class. There is a quiz everyday but he let's you use your notes.

Exams were straight from what he taught in class and from the homework. As long as you pay attention, take notes, and do practice problems from the homework, you will get a good grade.

1639,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,4.0,"she changes the syllabus throughout the semester to fit her wants and needs , must show work as you get no credit for guessing, she can teach the subject but she changes the grades how she wants if she feels your grades to high she will change it ,also the extra credit is worthless, all of them combined is about 3 points"
1640,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,3.0,3.0,"Pinkston is very sweet. If you participate and show her you genuinely care about getting a good grade, she will work with you to get a good grade. However, she has a hard time handling stupid kids. This means class will be stopped to ridicule those that aren't paying attention, being obnoxious, etc. Felt a little like high school at these points."
1641,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,3.0,"It was pretty easy, but if you don't attend class or do your homework it will be difficult. There is a lot of extra credit opportunities and she also has office hours in the Math Lab."
1642,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,3.0,"Professor P is a GREAT teacher, no doubt about it. The homework and tests were acceptable and I enjoyed the lectures. It's just that there was a point in where all she would do is nag and call people out. By the end of the semester, I just wanted the class to end because I couldn't stand it."
1643,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"If you have trouble in math take this professor. You will have ""pop quizzes"" at the start of every class but these count for extra credit/warm-ups. Before taking tests she will put a review on Aleks for you to study from. There's 4 tests &amp; the final along with hw on Aleks &amp; classwork. Class can seem a bit slow from time to time but it's worth it."
1644,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,3.0,"Professor Pinkston is the BEST math teacher I've ever had! I was intimidated by all the negative reviews but she is a wonderful teacher. Her lectures are easy to understand and the online program she uses, Aleks is also great practice. Math is my worst subject but she makes it enjoyable. She gives lots of extra credit so it helps bring up grades."
1645,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,3.0,She has opportunities fro extra credit for every test and if you pay attention in class most of the class is very simple. She tends to work problems on the projector as a learning medium which is very helpful. She can be a little rough at the beginning but once you get to know her it's pretty okay.
1646,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,4.0,4.0,"Pay attention, asks questions, and study. She wont baby you, but she's not hard on you either. I deserved the grade I got."
1647,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,2.0,"Most of the bad reviews are old and not accurate. She gives you lots of extra credit, she will drop your lowest grades and go over test questions. She is beyond caring and I have seen her giving us chances to not mess our GPA. Take her over Demsky and Brooks... Trust me. Little homework guarantee! I fail this class before, She was a blessing for me"
1648,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,Calculus is a very demanding class for those who don't have the basis or have forgotten. Professor Pinkston teaches by solving problems which makes it so much easier to understand. Feel free to ask questions in class if you don't understand. Her method is great and straight to the point. She's really caring for her students and wants you tosucceed
1649,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pinkston teaches by solving problems using the overhead projector. Then the class solves problems on the board, providing immediate feedback. She is always available to help students. Reviews conducted prior to tests. Tests are closed book no notes. You will be challenged to be your very best. A great learning experience."
1650,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,She is a little impatient and can get on you . But she truly cares about you and wants you to succeed .

She worked a lot with me and helped me succeed even when the world wanted me to fail.
1651,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,1.0,Take her only if you are well prepared for Mat1033 she expects you to already know everything if not she will request for you to take the math before Mat1033.
1652,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,Took this teacher Fall term 2018. All though she is somewhat nice she is also rude and makes you fell like your stupid. Not only that but she doesnt teach that well. Its much easier to learn from Aleks. She marks you for the tiniest things. She may be like this but she will also drop your lowest test grade. Expect to get at least a C in this class.
1653,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,3.0,Teaches way to fast. Doesn't give students a chance to fully understand lesson before moving on.
1654,855300,Pat,Pinkston,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,I love this professor she is really nice but she does everything really fast I guess that is just her style of teaching so really pay atttention and do jot miss class.

She is rude, doesnt teach very well and expects everyone to understand the equations she writes, also what she teaches in class does NOT CORRELATE with what ever equation is on ALEKS. I suggest u drop out of her class before youre trapped forever. She displays everyones business and is just overall awful"

1661,873433,Wesley,Wright,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"Chill, Cool prof. The main grade is One essay which is 15 pages long. May seem bad but if u have perfect attendance u get 5 pages off. Also in the class all u do is talk and watch gangster movies, can get pages off if answer questions of the movie which can be hard. Overall easy class if u don't procrastinate (DONT TAKE IF U PROCRASTINATE)."
1662,873433,Wesley,Wright,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,1.0,"Professor Wright, is one of the few professors in Broward College that actually care. I took ENC1101 and 1102, with him and never had any problem. If you dont like writing this Professor will actually help you enjoy it.

1762,425967,Gordon,Maddison,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"This review is the one that will tell the story. Yes, he is a 5-Star professor. Yes, its a 2 of 5 in difficulty (max). Yes, he does talk all class and ramble, jumping from topic to topic, however, he is just waiting for students to engage. He is the type of professor that would never make a student feel stupid or uncomfortable. 4.0 student here"
1764,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,5.0,1.0,Best professor ever. Gives you all answers to test in her lectures. She prints the notes she wants you to study and makes you follow along in class. Not much homework at all. Tells funny jokes in class. Very kind and a pleasant person to talk to. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
1765,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2004,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed professor Rothschild class. She is so kind and is very passionate about psychology. Her class is mostly lectures and reading notes but the tests are so easy if you pay attention and read her notes, they are literally word for word. If you don't pass its because you didn't read your notes. She's the best."
1766,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,1.0,4.0,"Honestly hated every minute of this class, she grades you only based on 5 test, and she gives a lot of extra credit but those are the only grades. the test are based off of her in class lectures and make no sense most of the time, can't explain how she came up with your final grade, you fins out your final grade the last day of class. hated it!"
1767,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,5.0,4.0,"She is fantastic. She gives great opportunities for students to receive good grades. You must study and work for it, but her teaching will guide you through. She is a wonderful professor and person. Strong Recommendation!"
1768,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rothschild is such a good teacher, so good that I'm taking her for another class next semester! She is a bit lecture heavy but she gives you the notes so you can follow along which she emails before the class and what's in the notes is exactly what the test is. We only have 5 tests just read your notes! She gives a lot of extra credit too"
1769,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2002,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Rothschild's class was decent to take. Personally not a fan of her taking the class time to just read her notes. However, it seems she has a more old-fashioned way of conducting her class. Tests are based off notes. Gives many opportunities to get extra credit, which is very nice."
1770,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,4.0,3.0,"Her class is simple, you don't need the book everything in the tests is from the notes. Study a little before the tests, pay attention to the class and take some notes, you will get an A. She gives opportunities of extra-credit by reading books and/or go to workshops."
1771,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,2.0,2.0,"The test are the exact notes, if you study them you'll pass. Attendance is graded but not at all mandatory to pass. She's super opinionated and always has to be right, so just go to class and listen and youll be fine."
1772,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,5.0,3.0,"She was funny, kind, knowledgable, and an excellent professor. There are only 6 total grades (5 tests and 1 total grade for attendance) plus plenty of extra credit opportunities. If you aren't the best test-taker, take advantage of this because it will increase your grade dramatically!"
1773,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PHY2012,3.0,4.0,"Her class is exam based. She emails the notes to you, but I highly suggest you go to every class because she adds a lot more essential things to the notes. She does offer extra credit and let me just say I barely got an A because I did so much extra credit!"
1774,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,3.0,4.0,"You HAVE to study for this class, even though the tests are easy. There is so much stuff to remember, don't try to cram it in the night before. Gives A LOT of extra credit and attendance is mandatory, or else it'll count against you. Her lectures are ok but make sure you pay attention, as she emails you the notes and you have to fill them in."
1775,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,4.0,3.0,"I really liked her. She's a little cooky but I really enjoyed her class. She is stickler and tough on her students. She is very serious about attendance, so don't miss a class or it counts against you. STUDY YOUR NOTES. You won't pass if you don't study her notes. Don't bother getting the textbook."
1776,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,3.0,4.0,"You HAVE to study for this class. Read her notes, do EVERY extra credit she offers plus the books and attend EVERY class (If possible). If you take this class i recommend you do all the writing requirements and extra credit books, it will save your grade ! Otherwise, she does not post on D2L so keep track of your grades."
1777,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,1.0,1.0,"I regret everything about taking this class. She is a very opinionated person and thats all she lectured about. DO NOT purchase a text book, just read her opinionated notes and youll pass. Its actually a joke. A huge portion of your grade is attendance, could be a good or bad thing. Bottom line, just show up and listen to her opinions to pass."
1778,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,2.0,4.0,"Grades based on five tests, each not cumulative, and attendance. However, she subtracts five points for missing class. She does offer extra credit which gets added to attendance. At the end, she takes the average of the five tests and attendance for your grade. Her lectures can be boring, but as long as one studies the notes, it's not hard to pass."
1779,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,3.0,3.0,Takes attendance and showing up late very seriously she marks off points if your late or absent. She is an extremely opinionated woman but if you just let her have it your not gonna have a problem. Listen to what she says and do it. Read those packets she gives you. the tests are literally only based off the packet. never got a book and I got an A.
1780,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,4.0,3.0,general psych was not at the top of my list of favorite subjects to take but I had to take it for my career. She gives a lot of extra credit. Her tests are straight forward. Read her notes and re -read every night just for a few minutes and you will pass her tests. Her tests come from the exact notes! Attendance is big!
1781,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,DEP2004,5.0,4.0,"Her spirit is beautiful and I honestly wish I could have her as a mentor. The notes mirror the tests and, at least for me, she had my attention. Her personality can come off a little harsh at first but that's bc she's a no BS woman! I feel that her lectures are inviting enough to help open your mind to things you'd rather be closed off about."
1782,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY327,5.0,2.0,Professor Rothschild was an amazing teacher. I took her online Abnormal Psychology class at Saint Leo University. Passed with an A+. You write a paper but each week you turn a piece of the paper in which makes writing it so much easier and less hectic. I also took her again for Psychology of Learning.
1783,1204345,Ronnie,Rothschild,Broward College (all campuses),Behavioral Sciences,PSY2012,4.0,4.0,"It's difficult if you don't study because your grades are from tests; aside from some extra credit offered. It is a lot to study but this class has taught me to develop better study skills. I just don't like it when she rushes through packets when the class is behind and needs to catch up. If you have good study skills, take this class."
1785,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2020,5.0,4.0,"No pop quizzes in class only summaries due. He's not mean as the ratings depict him. He's class is easy only grades Midterm, Final, and summaries. Attendance used to be mandatory till we transitioned to remote learning he made it optional. I would take him again. Great Professor"
1786,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1011,1.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE! He always has extra seats in his class for a reason. He's rude, HIs teaching is terribly boring and don't be late because even if you're 5 minutes late, you'll receive a fat F for the course. If you end up taking him, god bless your soul."
1787,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,"Ahem, I'm one of the students that give up my pride to get a good grade in this class. THIS CLASS IS DUMB HARD WITH THE WAY HE'S GRADING. He expects too much from us. He thinks we are some professional writers. He doesn't teach anything, beside the materials we already learned in high school. He loves talking about his works in China as a professor"
1788,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,"The most unorganized office I've ever seen and it reflects his teaching ethics. Has no idea where any of his classes are, he repeats the same material and he feels that it's so enlightening to us. Required to buy his own book which I would say is for profit even though it's splattered with his personal life stories that serve no benefit to anyone."
1789,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,4.0,2.0,"I found Professor Koppelman to be quite easy despite the reviews. As long as you show up to class on time and staple all of your work then you wont have much to worry about. His assignments consist of of note taking and like 3 essays, which he gives you ample enough time for. If you come off as a hard worker, he will respect that!"
1790,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,4.0,"Too many papers. Doesn't teach anything. He says he is willing to help, but when asked for help he looks down on you. Grades you toughly on stuff he hasn't even taught you yet. No clear grading system, which makes the whole grade subjective to his liking. Would not recommend him at all."
1791,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,"Do not ever take him even if he is last resort, worst teacher you will ever take."
1792,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1011,1.0,4.0,"He has no care his students. He's a perfectionist, if you do not do things the way he wants it to be no matter how much effort and time you put into it ""C""- to a ""F"". It is as rare to see anyone get higher than a ""C"" as it is to see a red moon. He's self centered, he is also very rude. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!"
1793,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1011,1.0,4.0,STAY AWAY FROM HIM!!!!!
1794,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,4.0,"Just dont. He doesnt care for his students, you cant miss or be late for 4+ classes, cuz youre out. You have to be right on time. Doesnt take the assignments if you were 2 min late. Not clear. Sarcastic. Self centered. Makes you feel stupid. Doesnt do online stuff. Youll know your grades after the semester is over. Very picky. Talks too much"
1795,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC101,1.0,5.0,STAY AWAYYYY FROM HIM PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
1796,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1011,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This is THE WORST teacher i have ever had. Extremely rude and is not clear about what he looks for when he grades. Very self centered. Does not explain why you receive a low grade on an assignment. Doesn't post grades so you have no idea what you have until the end. very disrespectful to his students in general. just awful.
1797,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,"I've taken ENC1102 at BC Central with a different teacher and it really showed me how unnecessarily difficult Dr. Koppelman makes the couse. If your homework isn't stapled or if you're late, he won't accept your work. He gives so many long and tedious assignments (a 2000 word essay for example) and spends a lot of time talking about himself."
1798,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,1.0,4.0,"Not understanding at all. Whatever reason you give him for anything, doesnt care and has his own opinion. Only talks about himself in class, doesnt include student participation AT ALL. If you can avoid him, at my best advice. PLEASE DO."
1799,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,He the worse English teacher u can get.
1800,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,1.0,3.0,"Terrible choice taking this class. He's not a reasonable teacher, he doesn't have a specific grading scale. He doesn't post anything online. Just be prepared to settle with a D or a C even putting in a lot of effort"
1801,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,2.0,5.0,"This professor is terrible. Highly recommend you don't take him. He will look for every excuse, even if it isn't logical to give you a C or a D. Also don't bother writing anything political, he'll give you a poor grade if it is anything but liberal."
1802,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,4.0,Don't take this professor. I would only tell nothing but the truth to help you succeed . He thinks he knows everything . He is very smart with his mouth . Don't miss any days of his class or he will fail you. If the work is not done how he likes it you will receive a C or D . It's as if you don't learn or progress in his class. Everything is a prob
1803,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,"Professor Koppelman is a awful teacher. he does not care about anyone expect himself. half of the class he talks about baseball, he coughs while you are presenting your research paper. don't bother taking this class he will not give a passing grade."
1804,965607,Robert,Koppelman,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,2.0,4.0,"If you miss more than four classes, even with a valid reason + proper documentation + communication, he fails you no matter how well you've been doing in class. I had an B in the class until I missed five classes, mostly because of transportation problems - I emailed him and he told me to not come to class anymore. Assignments and essays are easy."
1806,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,BSC2010,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE HER! She is the definition of not caring about her students! Tests are very difficult and to prepare she just tells you to study everything. She does not want to see you succeed! Worst bio professor. If i could give her a zero out of five i would.
1807,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,4.0,4.0,"prof. Burgess is tough cookie. Everything tough that comes to mind is all inclusive in her classes, BUT i will still recommend you to take her. There is so much that I remember from her lectures about those damn microbes, because she knows how to present the material and keep you on the right track. She is loves what she does and that fascinating"
1808,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,5.0,4.0,"She is one of the best professors Ive had. She really cares for her students and her passion shows. She is not an easy A, you really have to understand the concepts and study because her tests involve a lot of essay questions. Most people might rate her poorly because of this, but if you really want to learn then theres no better choice."
1809,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,1.0,5.0,she doesnt care if you pass or fail. she will leave you with a 69.9 and not bat an eye. her lectures and outlines arent useful at all for the quizzes or the exams. even if you have a 100% average on your discussions and quizzes. you have to have a good average on the exams and case study to pass. super un-supportive and un-helpful. learned nothin
1810,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,BSC2010,1.0,4.0,"Her style of teaching is not effective, she only reads of these powerpoints and she is always in a bad mood. Every time someone asked a question she would have an attitude. She expects you to learn irrelevant material that does not pertain to her exams and gets annoyed that we focus more on our exams grades than the ""lesson"" she's teaching. 0/10."
1811,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,4.0,5.0,"This class involves 5 quizzes with unlimited tries, 5 exams with an optional final that replaces your lowest test grade, 5 discussions, and an individual case study. The tests are pretty tough so study!!! She doesn't put the lectures or powerpoints on the website so take notes during lectures."
1812,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,BSC2010,1.0,5.0,Here is a list of things I did not like in this blended course: No clear grading Exams are super hard with at least 3 essays (she gives 5 essays and 3 are randomly picked) lecture heavy posted recorded lectures and essays late belittle if you ask a question and sarcastic unrealistic expectations with amount of work and time we had DONT TAKE HER!!
1813,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB1020,1.0,5.0,"I honestly thought by the UNLIMITED chances of quizzes her class was easy. First, every time you fail the quiz the question changes and gets harder. Her powerpoint lecture is NOTHING like on the actual exam. You find yourself taking notes for nothing. Her exams are extremely hard - I pulled teeth to get a C. Find someone else"
1814,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,1.0,4.0,"Her lectures are endless and she doesn't post the PowerPoints on D2l making it difficult to know what to study for the exams. Some of her quizzes and exams have questions about information she never covered. If you want a professor that has all the information they teach you posted on d2l, don't take her."
1815,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010L,5.0,4.0,"Prof. B is a TOUGH GRADER AND SPELLING COUNTS. She is incredibly smart and will go above and beyond to help her students. The material is hard, so be prepared to work and try to pick a good partner for lab as you will be stuck with that person for the semester."
1816,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,4.0,4.0,"Let's be REAL. 5 quizzes- take unlimited times until you get 100% at home (questions are seen on exams again, EASY) 5 test also taken at home open notes, book, and Google. (YOU NEED TO STUDY, attend class, and takes notes to PASS!) 5 homework assignments submitted online (EASY) Case Study Assignment a bit challenging but doable. No extra credit."
1817,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,BSC2010,5.0,4.0,"It is kinda funny that the students who are not prepared and don't want to work don't like her. The students who are prepared and want to learn, do their work and love her. She teaches really well and gives good examples as well as lots of tricks. I think she is just the best teacher I have had so far!!! I will certainly be taking her again!!"
1818,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,BSC2010,2.0,4.0,"Her lectures are her power points, word for word, yet she still gets frustrated when students show little interest or forget something she mentions in passing. Her out-dated teaching style does not do her students any favors and I personally needed to teach myself a lot, just to maintain my interest in the subject. She should be at a high school."
1819,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,5.0,3.0,"I did the bare minimun in this class because im a transient student and do not get the grade, but I get the credit. Her class is easy as long as you read, and she gives great lectures"

Pre-lab quizzes before every lab, 2 assignments, 2 test, and 2 practicals. Plays music during lab (it gets you going) Has a humor that is light and refreshing. Study, stay on top of work and you will pass!!"

I was a very shy student, but she spent time talking to me after class and wrote me an excellent letter of rec that helped me get into my program. Now I'm going for my PhD and owe a lot of it to her teaching. Put in the work; it'll pay off."

She is a hard core professor... either you love or you hate it ! Study 5 hours a day and you will be good .. I managed to get an A and I was doing anatomy as well , soooooo it is totally up to you !"
1823,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010L,5.0,4.0,"Professor B is nothing short of AMAZING! I feel like the negative reviews about her must be from people who expect easy A's. Microbiology is NOT an easy course but she makes the Lab so enjoyable. She clearly explains each lab, gives good notes and yes, she forces you to write them down, but it is for your benefit!"
1824,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010L,1.0,5.0,She was awfully rude I didnt actually take her class but I was in a car accident and was confined to a wheelchair when it came time for finals because I am limited on mobility I was given permission to attend for extra time she kicked me out for using my phone to take pictures of the mock test result for my Quizlet. I feel bad for her students!!
1825,1005609,Lisa,Burgess,Broward College (all campuses),Biological Sciences,MCB2010,1.0,5.0,"Her idea of teaching is to lecture word-for-word from her power points which she does NOT post in D2L, nor will she allow you to take pictures of the slides. She also rushes through lecture and when you ask her questions, she gets mad. I would not recommend her as a pre-school teacher. She's the worst science professor at BC Central."
1827,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2085,1.0,4.0,"I will say DO NOT TAKE HIM! I had him for lecture and lab, he knows a lot but doesn't know how to teach. At the beginning of every class he would started talking nonsense. He is very negative, he will tell you that if you don't pass you better change you career/major. STUDY A LOT."

1831,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BCS2085,4.0,4.0,Lots of studying. I didnt buy the book or code . U get 10 points connect. I did receive the points bcz I complete all the activities by my free weeks trial. 20 extra credit in all. Each test have 1-3 extra credit questions. Tests are based on his outlines. He will tell u wat to highlight Sometimes. Focus on bold words. If u study its not tht hard
1832,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BCS2085,5.0,2.0,Hes a really good teacher. You have to study to pass his class. If you dont focus you will fail. Even if Im not going to pass with an A its because of me but its really easy to pass his class. He always gives extra credit for all the tests. I will definitely take him for bsc 2086/bsc2086l
1833,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2085L,3.0,4.0,I had to put in 20 hr+ study week to get an A. Would not recommend if you are looking for a teacher to explain things in detail. He would basically take attendance and leave next door for half of the class. Takes long to put in test grades and no study guides.
1834,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2086L,2.0,4.0,"he isn't exactly the nicest, but is not just plain rude. He talks almost the entire lab, basically reading the book to us and last minute wants to rush experiments. That isn't a great way to teach students, especially when it comes to practicals where we actually have to understand how the experiment was done. All in all, teach yourself."
1835,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2086,5.0,3.0,"After having Asad for AP1 I was prepared for the worst. Siddique was a breath of fresh air. Exams were straightforward and reasonable. He really cares. Study packets, online access to lectures, &amp; Powerpoints helpful. Plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Intense class, take only this &amp; lab! Needed 15hr/wk study to get A. Most needed 20hr+/wk."
1836,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2086,5.0,3.0,"Took professor Siddique for lecture. Professor explains and breaks downs everything he covers in class. He provides you with a outline that is a key point. The outlines are very important. You must also study and put in the extra work, this is a tough class and professor siddique does his best to help his students understand the material."
1837,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2086L,2.0,4.0,"I took him for lab, not the best Professor.. He knows what he is talking about and is very knowledgeable on the subject, however he's teaching method is not the best. Another thing i hated is he took FOREVER to grade. Expect to get your grade back a week after the quiz/test. Overall wish i would have gone with Dr. Nelson for my lab class."
1838,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,AP1085,5.0,4.0,"I took him for AP 1, AP 1 lab, AP 2 n AP 2 lab. He changed my life n made me fall in love w/ nursing n the human body. Amazing lecture. A lot of studying. In lecture you get 5 test, with 3 to 4 Chapters each test. You have to work for your grade. He is tricky. But the way he teaches u will remember the info. I received an A n B each time."
1839,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BCS2085,3.0,5.0,You either hate him or love him. The first day of class hell tell you how hard it is. He isnt doing to scare you hes being serious. Started off with 36 classmates ended with 10. Study study study and youll be fine. If youre a lazy student dont even bother.
1840,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2086L,4.0,5.0,"Professor is strict and too the point. You are there to learn, you're paying to learn so be prepared to commit to this class on a full time basis or you won't pass. Make use of ASC !!!You are expected to read ahead and self learn each lesson before your class. GREAT professor and I respect him for his strictness."
1841,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2086L,5.0,4.0,"His class is not for the lazy and the people who are uninterested in school. You get what you deserve. Prof Siddique is very smart, he is not too friendly but teaches the class well. O yes, the tests are tough, however you will learn a lot. He clearly states, ""your time, your money, your grades"". I had a final score of 88.75 but he gave me an A."
1842,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BCS2085,4.0,4.0,Tests based on his handouts. Tells you what to focus on. Only grades are six multiple choice test and some extra credit. Points for attendance. Recorded lectures on Connect helpful to study. Make time to study and revise especially with lab ASC is your friend!! Great teacher and willing to help if needed. Don't fall behind.
1843,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2085L,4.0,4.0,"Professor Siddique seem to be tough at first but is really a professor who is a straight shooter. He will tell you like it is and NOT what you want to hear. If you are someone who likes to be spoon fed, this is NOT the professor for you! Get ready to earn your grades! Time to grow up people! It only gets harder! :0"
1844,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,ANAT1,2.0,4.0,"For lecture, he supplies notes to the next coming tests. This was great as students knew exactly what to tackle while studying. Lab was very unorganized. Its really your call. If you can manage to study the material ( 2-3 chapers a test very time consuming) then go for it! I recommend another professor as he is rude, unapproachable, and tough."
1845,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,ANATOMY1AND2,5.0,5.0,YOU WILL HAVE TO STUDY EVERDAY TO PASS HIS CLASS WITH AN A. This class is easy if you devote your life to studying.
1846,435163,Ehsan,Siddique,Broward College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2086,5.0,4.0,"Maybe I took another Siddique. Fantastic professor. Teaches his subject very well. People with negative reviews won't do well in a science major. Work hard, its YOUR future! I've never taken a multiple choice exam in any lab. I got over 100% in both lecture/lab with extra credit cause I worked hard. Take him. Prepare your future, road gets rougher"
1848,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,OCE1001,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor! He helped everyone pass his class by giving lots of extra credit. There are only 3 test but he helps you pass by giving all the necessary notes and gives extra credit as well!
1849,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,ESC1000,5.0,1.0,"I took this class this semester for a mini term, 6 weeks. I had 3 tests, 1 was at home and 2 in class. All tests are based on the practice test so, do them. The answers are on quizlett. Easiest class ever"
1850,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,OCE1001,1.0,4.0,DO NOT take this teacher I took his 6 week course during the summer and I had to withdraw from his class. He tries to teach his 16 wk curriculum in 6 wks and doesn't even try to lecture during class. You have to read EVERYTHING from the book because he doesn't do any type of test review and nothing is graded besides the three tests.
1851,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1010,1.0,5.0,"worst teacher ever , choose another one if you want to pass this class"
1852,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1010,1.0,5.0,"Do yourself a favor and select a different professor if you don't want to fail this class. He doesn't teach and gets surprised when students don't understand GEOLOGY! Worst teacher ever , I can't even call him a teacher. He needs to retire since he don't want to do his job anymore."
1853,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,OCE1001,5.0,3.0,He seems to care that you learn about the oceans. Spends most of class reviewing the reading assignments that he says you must do before he talks about it. Does not put up with nonsense and whiney people in class so some do not like him
1854,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1010,5.0,3.0,"He was very patient and easy going. I was scared of this class but this professor taught it well enough that I was able to achieve an ""A""."
1855,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1010,5.0,3.0,One of the most patient teachers and is very fair. He is encouraging and creates an atmosphere of teamwork and the class feels like a family. Great professor and I would be happy to have him as a teacher again.
1856,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1010,1.0,4.0,"WORST TEACHER I EVER HAD.  DOES NOT LECTURE UNTIL YOU DO THE WORK AT HOME FIRST. ONLY GRADES YOU BASED ON 3 TEST GRADES, AND THE QUIZ GRADE WHICH YOU TAKE ALL  48 OF THEM ONLINE. YES, 48 QUIZZES AND YOU HAVE TO READ EVERYTHING AND TEACH YOURSELF."
1857,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1010,1.0,5.0,"This professor don't believe in giving lectures, and he wants us to use the online program which is not a good source of content. He thinks in class lectures are not important, and student should self read the entire book. Instead of taking about the chapter he google random topics and talk about them which is useless for students."
1858,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1010,1.0,3.0,He is a very nice person but he was not a good professor and I would never suggest anyone take him. Never lectured once. Class was waste of time. Everyone in class was very disappointed and frustrated with his lack of teaching and his apathy towards the course. Only take him if you're prepared for 100% online and twiddling your thumbs in class.
1859,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1001,2.0,2.0,"He barely teaches and sometimes gives assignments and he's surprised when we don't know the material. Seems to know a lot about his field since he has done research, too bad he doesn't actually teach the class. My class was small so he ""restructured"" the way he would teach. it was for the worse. I did not learn much."
1860,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1001,2.0,2.0,Would not recommend Prof Muza. The whole semester we just watched pointless videos and he would occasionally sit us down to teach us a bit about different rocks and such. He gave us a project where each student does a ppt. on time periods basically for us to teach the class the material. I really didn't learn much at all in the class.
1861,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,ESC1000,3.0,1.0,"This professor is so easy! No homework, and he only gives three tests based off of the Quizlet questions. All you have to do is study the Quizlet answers the week before the test and you'll do great!!!"
1862,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,OCE1101,3.0,4.0,"I took the open college course for OCE and it was pretty much buy the videos and the book and study the review for the two tests he gave us, and those two tests were our grade. The reviews were basically the test, and he even curved them. He answers all your questions and is very knowledgeable and cares about helping you. TAKE HIM"
1863,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,OCE1000,5.0,3.0,This class is for self discipline students. you will learned but you have to do a lot of reading on your own. It was the easies class I ever took.
1864,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,ESC1000,2.0,1.0,"If you take this class, be sure to use two computers. He now makes you use Lockdown Browser when taking quizzes so you should use Quizlet on the other computer to help you out. Otherwise, easy class. Take him; you won't regret it."
1865,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1010,1.0,5.0,There are no lectures. He doesn't go over the material on tests. You have to read on your own long long long chapters and get tested on them. He does not teach. Just don't do it. Trust me.
1866,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1001,3.5,5.0,"While this professor seems like he's great, the class itself is awful! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF IT IS VIDEO-BASED. There is no homework, but there are only five times  you meet in the semester. You teach everything yourself online and there are only two tests: one worth 50%, the other worth 50%. Time consuming and hard. Don't take it."
1867,881353,Jay,Muza,Broward College (all campuses),Geology,GLY1001,3.5,2.0,I love him..... He made this semester smooth and understands students who are not majoring in this subject. Take him you won't regret it. He is awesome.
1869,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,1.0,5.0,"WORST PROFESSOR EVER. Not only is she terrible at teaching she is also extremely cruel. She likes to do test questions with multiple parts and they are all or nothing. So if you get one part wrong and the rest of there parts are right you will get 0 credit. Save your money, time, and tears and stay away from her class."
1870,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,2.0,"This professor is no longer teaching at Broward College. Regardless of this, she is a legend in broward. Her students perform better in their programs because she teaches and not only passes students. Rate my professor allows a form of harassment weak students have against professors who really teach and push them forward."
1871,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BCS2085,1.0,5.0,"WORST professor iv'e ever taken! She teaches right from the PowerPoint and does not make it easy to understand at all. Attendance is mandatory! Test are very long and are extremely difficult, I noticed that some of the material on the test are not even on the PowerPoint!"
1872,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086L,2.0,5.0,Took the fast course class and it was very challenging. Shes super strict. alot of people dropped out of her class until there were only 10 of us. In this class you have to study hard but i feel like she made it more harder. pick someone else if you can.
1873,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,5.0,3.0,"Being a medical doctor gives this class at particular edge, and angle that you can not see in other classes. I am lucky to have her as a teacher this semester. I am inspired and will take her for anatomy 2 in the winter term. Amazing"
1874,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,3.0,"Health sciences are not for everyone, face it. I knew the class was not going to be easy but I wanted to learn from somebody who is among the best in the department. Dr. Ampudia is sweet and caring but far from a pushover. She really knows micro and can help you learn even the most difficult stuff if you let her know where youre need help."
1875,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,1.0,5.0,She teaches off of power points that does not pertain to the tests. STUDY CONNECT! Her tests are from connect. Sh gives no study guides and does not help at all. She doesn't get through all the chapters. You basically have to teach your self microbiology with her because she gets through not even half of a chapter! Good Luck to who ever takes her!
1876,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,1.0,5.0,I know Micro is a hard subject and studying is a must but having a teacher that tries their very best to make sure students are grasping the material helps. I strongly believe this prof does the bare minimal. You will be basically teaching yourself. Covers all chapters with little to no assistance from the prof. Save your time and tears.
1877,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,4.0,"Take this class with Dr. Ampudia if you are serious about learning and passionate about science. You can learn a lot from her but many are not willing to do the work, I don't get it. I recommend asking a lot of questions, she is very approachable. Tough but interesting material. Will take her again."
1878,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,4.0,By far the most challenging yet rewarding class I have ever taken.
1879,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,1.0,4.0,"Does not listen to her students when they ask for help. She directs students to pay for a tutor when they are having difficulty. Connect homework takes forever to complete and is mandatory for the tests. There is a test every two weeks with 3-8 chapters per test. No study guide given. Beware of this professor, avoid her while you can."
1880,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,1.0,5.0,"I just want to give a heads up to anyone considering this professor  This class you basically have to learn everything yourself bc she doesnt help you out at all. Shes all or nothing. No reviews, no study guides, no extra credit. She also has a bad habit of lecturing past the class time. Very strict professor. You only get grades from exams."
1881,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085L,1.0,4.0,"Cruel rules. If you are even a few minutes late, you get zeros for all of the h.w, class assignments, and attendance for the day. Rude to students. Must be super human to please her"
1882,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,2086L,5.0,4.0,"Dr Ampudia's class fills quickly since everyone knows she is an actual MD with a passion for teaching. Few make it to the end of the class but you can do great if you study and not spend time like so many looking for ways to get the answers to tests. I learned so much from her was able to get into medical school, she was my inspiration."
1883,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,4.0,"The best professor that I have had thus far in my college career. Ask about anything: she knows about i! Amazing lectures, she really helps you remember things with useful tips and tricks. She relates course content to the real world. Remember micro is a hard class as is, it will take a lot of reading and studying. Will help you succeed if you try!"
1884,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,5.0,"Im currently taking microbiology with this professor. So far I have gotten good grades and more important than that, I am learning. We cover the whole book in one semester so the class is hard, I cannot lie. But there are some of us who take it and do well and those that complain. I think some of the reviews are false and probably all done by 1."
1885,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BIOL3320,5.0,4.0,Shes awesome!! At first she was very tough but its because the class itself is hard you obviously have to study a lot. She teaches really well and ties in what we learn to things she has experienced from working in the medical field. If you show motivation and that youre truly interested in the class it also helps. Honestly would recommend her
1886,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,3.0,4.0,"She is a nice professor but only reads off of slides which is a problem for me because I like professors to teach off of their own knowledge and experience. This class is tough and you WILL NOT pass if you do not study. There are 6 tests and she does give extra credit opportunities, but your grades are heavily dependent on the tests."
1887,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BSC1005,5.0,2.0,"One of the best teachers I have ever had. Her criteria was clearly explained in syllabus and she read and explained that syllabus point by point to us. When some said she quizzed on material not in book, she showed highlighted and numbered by question, the book material. Quiz before each lab is standard lab practice. Just ask around. be nice."
1888,1333098,Carolina,Ampudia,Broward College (all campuses),Science,BSCL1005,2.0,4.0,Be prepared to take a quiz every class. She expects you to read and complete the lab manual before class. You can read the manual multiple times and still do poorly. Only if you have no other option should you take this class. You must have a strong science background and be able to work independently in order to take her class.
1890,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2011,5.0,3.0,would take this class 100x again. he gives feedback and grades proctored tests with curves. love this guy.
1891,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2100,5.0,4.0,Professor Applebaum is an awesome professor that cares about his students. He gives extra credit to help you because some of the chapters are very difficult. He is responsive to your emails. I love this professor and wish I could take him for ACG2110.
1892,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2100,5.0,4.0,"If you want a professor that gives you fast and detailed feedback; have all his expectations, assignments, and due dates in the syllabus from the beginning of the class; post your grades as soon the assignments are closed; understanding and ready to help chose professor Applebaum. He gave us extra credit points and also extra credit opportunities."
1893,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2011,3.0,4.0,According to the syllabus there is 25 points extra credit but we only received 10. Did not reopen assignments/discussions to give you a chance if you missed anything as most online profs do. The tests were HARD no matter how much I studied. The problems would be completely dif than the classwork. Syllabus had wrong due dates. Do not recommend him.
1894,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2011,5.0,4.0,"Good professor. Answers emails and questions quickly. Syllabus did have errors but was corrected the third day of class. Lots of emails but all had important information. 2 to 3 hours of work each week. Do all the discussion, easy points. Got an A better than my acct 1 prof."
1895,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2011,3.0,3.0,I don't know how this prof has such good ratings. He emails non stop but his syllabus had all the due dates wrong so I planned ahead in vain. You can't work ahead because chapters are closed until a week before they are due. He takes off petty points in discussions. Would not take again or recommend. I still got an A but my acc 1 prof was better.
1896,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,AGC2001,1.0,4.0,"I took this professor based on the reviews from here. Although is he very nice, he does not help you at all. If you email him for help he explains it to you the same way the book does and always refer you to a tutor. I know that online classes are always harder but Ive always managed to do good. Just choose wisely before taking him."
1897,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2011,5.0,3.0,"He is so kind, he always answers your questions and concerns so promptly. He is a very easy grader and makes the class so much easier to work with. Since it was all online, you just need to log on to do your HW and Tests on Cengage and discussions on bconline. He's incredible, you can't go wrong with him! One of the best accounting profs ever!"
1898,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,3.0,"Love this professor! Class was fairly simple, mostly work on Cengage. You do have to do 1 discussion question per chapter but it helps you understand the material more. You also have to respond to two other students discussions. This is a great professor, he really cares about his students success. If you have any questions you can email him."
1899,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG0011,4.0,4.0,Great professor. Cant go wrong if you choose him. Attendance not mandatory but you could get lost if you dont attend. Took him for both ACG1101 and 1102 blended. Easy to reach if you ever have homework questions.
1900,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,3.0,Amazing funny professor. Not an easy class but he makes it enjoyable and is willing to help and answer all questions. 4 test plus homework. do not skip his lectures and put in atleast an hour of studying a day and you will pass with an A or B.
1901,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. He replied to my emails right away, and would send reminder emails when assignments were due. Also, sent handouts for the tougher chapters. I would definitely take him again."
1902,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,4.0,3.0,"Taking him now and it really is all about time management. Cengage takes up a lot of time (3 hours on the low end, 5-6 hours on the high end) so prepare for it accordingly. Discussion every chapter as well as online test, which is usually pretty hard."
1903,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACCOUNTING1,3.0,4.0,Honestly this teacher is fine I took it blended online so I had to do Cengage. Expect to teach yourself the material. I think I am reconsidering becoming an accountant haha. You never have to show up to class. Only like 6 people including myself do.
1904,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2011,5.0,3.0,He's wonderful I took it blended so that's where it hurt me. I just despise cengae .. But he's great . I had family trouble so that's why I didn't perform well in the class. But he's very understanding. I would take him again.
1905,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2011,5.0,2.0,Best accounting teacher at BC. I decided to  become an accounting major after the first accounting class i took. He explains everything perfectly and makes sure you understand before moving on.  I took ACG 1 &amp;2 and Managerial with him and got A's. If you don't pass with him you should probably change your major.
1906,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACC1101,5.0,3.0,"Except Managerial I took all the ACG with him in person and online. He doesn't give away points. He has great study guides, answers his emails promptly and the online homework, lessons, discussion, tests, well organized and will assist you if you were troubled to handle all the online process. Classes in person are engaging, and real life examples."
1907,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACC1101,5.0,1.0,"I took this class in the fall semester. It was one of the easiest online class i ever took. All the test are online. No proctored exams. There are discussion, but they are not very hard. If you spend time doing all homework, it's and easy A class. I would love to take this class again"
1908,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,1.0,"This professor is awesome, he really knows his stuff and is very good at helping you understand. The class honestly is not hard but the homework on Cengage is very tedious and is mainly busy work. You have plenty of time to do. I have an A so far and will most likely pass with an 95+ you do have to buy Cengage 120$. Def take him well worth it"
1909,306619,Alan,Applebaum,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2450C,5.0,1.0,Loved this teacher! He always answers any questions during class - quickbooks. He is very approachable!
1911,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,"I will say she is a pretty darn harsh grader when it comes to the journals. But almost anything else, she gives chances on. Her lectures are amazing and she is VERY honest. She made her own textbook so do not worry about buying one. She makes her class super comfortable while teaching. She really helps reform the way you type."
1912,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101ENC1102,5.0,2.0,Professor Wagner is one of the best professors at Broward College. She's very organized and her class is super straight forward. If you show up and follow directions it is impossible to fail. She gives a lot of feedback on work so you can improve. She's really nice &amp; always made the class laugh! If you put in the effort she will work with you.
1913,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101ENC1102,5.0,2.0,Truly my favorite teacher I've had so far! Grades super easy and doesn't keep you waiting for feedback on any assignments. She makes lectures super fun and she reads the stories for assignments with you in class and helps to give a better understanding of what you're actually reading. Took her for 1101 and 1102 and I 110% recommend her!!
1914,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Wagner was a very well respected, hilarious, and motivational teacher. She gave the options of pre-reads for papers so you can get the best grade with feedback for final drafts. She allowed us to print 60 pages off D2L for our ""textbook"" and read from that, so no purchase of text required. SHE'S AMAZING! I am taking her for 1102 in summer"
1915,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"Favorite professor ever! The discussions in class are intresting and informative. She does pre reads for most of your assignments, if you do a pre read and fix your mistakes, you'll most likely get a high grade. She is open to questions and really wants her students to suceed in her class. 10/10 would recommend."
1916,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,1.0,"AMAZING, please take her. She is the realest of the real doesnt make you feel stupid at all and really knows how to relate to class.

1919,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,I took her for 1101 and 1002. She's very entertaining and gives amazing feedback on papers and lets you fix them if you do the pre-reads. Show up to class even if it seems pointless. She reads the stories we need for our assignments in class and has a class discussion about them so the lectures really help. Take her you won't regret it.
1920,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,2.0,"I LOVE Ms. Wagner. So funny, and I loved the class theme. If you turn in your essay by the pre-read date, she edits it ALL for you! So easy to pass with an A, take her!"
1921,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101ENC1102,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors. I took Wagner for ENC1101 and again for 1102. Attendance is important; if you miss over 3 classes, points get deducted from your grade, don't miss unless it's an emergency. You will have to do some projects and write papers but she gives plenty of time and helpful feedback to make you a better writer. No tests or books!"
1922,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"I would recommend for everyone to take her, she is funny. her class has very easy assignments and everything she gives you is very clear to what she expects out of you"
1923,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,2.0,She is a great professor. She clearly wants her students to pass. She is incredibly fair with how she grades and will give you great feedback. You also get a chance to redo if you messed up really badly on papers. Sometimes it seems pointless but just show up to class. Attendance counts as part of your grade. I have no complaints about her class.
1924,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"I took her class for ENC1101 and about to take ENC1102 with her again next semester. She is the best teacher I've ever had. We had 2 essays to write, 3 journals, and a research paper. Everything is simple and she make it even easier by being available to pre-read your paper. You won't regret it. EASY A, TAKE HER RIGHT NOW"
1925,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,Her class was not hard at all but she does not hand you your grade. She gives mini essays but she will proof read them and correct any grammatical errors you may have so its hard to not get a good grade on them. She also has journals but those are easy as well as long as you answer the prompt. Syllabus is clear &amp; up to date.
1926,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"Professor Wagner is fantastic. This course is extremely easy, she holds your hand through every assignment.

1928,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,This is the only review you need to read. Professor Wagner is great she gives good feedbacks and she wants you to pass her class. Anyone who gives her a negative review didn't try. She has pre read (reading and giving feedbacks on the assignment) and she have rewrite so if you get a bad grade you can rewrite it. You get 4 freebies on being absent.
1929,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,I loved her ENC1101 class so much that I'm taking her for ENC1102.

1930,1152771,Michelle,Wagner,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,2.0,4.0,If you do your work you'll be fine just make sure its MLA format or she will fail you. Also make sure you make it to class even though it may feel pointless sometimes.
1932,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPAN1121,1.0,4.0,"Professor Gilley is not a teacher you want during the coronavirus pandemic. She does NOT notify you about any absences and if you are absent more than four times during the semester, you automatically fail the course. Also, she gives many lectures and her connect assignments were usually 30+ questions with 4 assignments a week. Would not recommend."
1933,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPAN1121,2.0,4.0,I'm currently taking this class online due to the pandemic. This professor does not really care about your grade or helping you out. She explains everything in english and teaches the class in english when the class is originally Spanish. That to me is not right. Other than those things she is a fun teacher and respectful.
1934,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,2.0,4.0,"She's not terrible but her way of teaching is just awful. She's rude to students with technical difficulties and isn't patient with anyone and we're in a pandemic and struggle as well. She works with what benefits herself and randomly assigned a test on a Saturday. If you don't know spanish at all, I don't recommend her."
1935,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1121,5.0,3.0,Professor Gilley is amazing. She was always available for help outside of class. I learned so much. I wish that I had taken her for SPN 1120.
1936,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPAN1121,1.0,4.0,Not a native speaker and marks you wrong for any little thing. She talks a lot and doesn't give good examples for homework or tests. Don't try to email her.
1937,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPAN1121,2.0,4.0,"Her tests are fill in the blanks and any spelling or spacing mistake will mark you wrong even if the answer might be correct.

1938,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1121,5.0,2.0,I excelled in SPN 1121 because Prof. Gilley is a wonderful teacher. She was always available for help before and after class as well.
1939,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1121,1.0,4.0,"Professor Holey at tries her best but she follows the book way too much. For Example, you translated something from the Internet and she sees some tense or verb which is explained in the next chapter, due to this takes off a lot of points. And the tests she gives do follow the example she gives but is quite hard for non-English speakers like me"
1940,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPAN1121,5.0,3.0,"I love Profe! SHe cares so much about her students, and I think everyone should take her.

She has online work but theyre all fairly simple, honestly with a little practice and some work put in this class is an easy A"
1943,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,5.0,3.0,Great profe!!! If she makes you work for it? Of course!!! This is college people not kindergarten anymore.

Other than that just study the material, pay attention and you should do great."
1948,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPAN1120,5.0,3.0,Great professor. She was always prepared. Contacts students if they are absent. Reviews material in class and during office hours. She is smart and she cares...
1949,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN2220,4.0,4.0,"Great lectures! She knows how to teach in a way for non-natives to understand. Made a 2 1/2 hr, class go by quickly w/ her humor and energy. However, gives a LOT of hw and from different platforms/worksheets. I had a messy binder due to this. Grading can be unclear. Has a standoffish attitude sometimes, but overall a knowledgeable professor!"
1950,546081,Holley,Gilley,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,4.0,3.0,"I learned so very much this semester in Prof. Gilley's class. I am looking forward to taking her for SPN 1121 in the fall. She is caring, funny and the class time flies because she is creative."

1953,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,1.0,"Without a doubt, easiest professor ever. I took him in fall of 2019. Answers for homework assignments are on quizlet. But considering every single student that semester passed with an A, I'm pretty sure things are a bit different. Anyway, he's pretty good."
1954,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,2.0,"One of the most greA test professors I ever had, he teaches excellent, is very funny, and gives all information for quizzes. Highly recommend."
1955,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,2.0,1.0,"Although I got a B in his class, I really had to work hard for it. His lectures are long af and can be very tiring, and he can talk from 12 o'clock to 1:50. On the bright-side, everything he say is on his test. You can take him if you want, but I would not recommended him to anyone."
1956,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,3.0,3.0,"More than half the time in class he spent talking about his life, then would randomly say something that would be on a test. He You will have to buy an online code for Revel. His ""lectures"" were very long and boring. No one paid attention in class. As long as you pass each test, you'll be fine."
1957,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,4.0,1.0,I'm pretty sure this class is the easiest class I will take in college. You have to take the tests in class and through Revel (which is basically the online textbook that you can access on your phone and do all the work on your phone) and those are SO EASY. We had to do a very EASY vocabulary assignment and that was it. He's a super easy A.
1958,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,1.0,open notes for tests which are super easy. He goes over a review of exactly what's on the test so write down everything he says. Revel is easy you can finish it in a week.
1959,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,1.0,best professor ever you wont regret him
1960,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,2.0,3.0,Not a great experience. He is not organized. Take someone else. Trust me...
1961,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,4.0,2.0,"Dr Hart is very caring and respectful. He has lived an impressive life and has alot of useful information to share with you. He has been in the Navy, business world, and an educator. He may seem a little bit unorthodox but in a good way. The course is an online Revel program with 17 chapters and a class with easy tests. You SHOULD get an A."
1962,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,2.0,4.0,Dont take.

1965,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,4.0,1.0,"He is great teacher! I took him over the summer fr 6 weeks, just do the connect assignments (those were time consuming) , exams were also on connect. He opened everything (assignment + exams) on the first day of class, attendance is not mandatory."
1966,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,1.0,1.0,"Dr. Hart is clearly a very passionate educator. But, he passes on misinformation in his classroom and discusses a lot of things that honestly have no place in a school setting. He's very vocal about his political beliefs and that very clearly skews what he teaches. It can be distracting. That aside, the class was very easy so long as you attend."
1967,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,3.0,3.0,He was ok.
1968,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,2.0,3.0,Great!
1969,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,1.0,I have to say this was the easiest semester by far. The best professor I've had thus far at BC. The work was easy and I do recommend taking notes during his lectures. Other than that you will pass with flying colors. Sociology is an interesting subject and he made it fun and he is worth listening to.
1970,356731,Michael,Hart,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,Very easy A and is laid back professor. Only 1 paper for a writing class. Heavy lectures. Just get the book and you will pass.

I did not enjoy this class."
1975,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,4.0,3.0,Took his online SYG200 class. Was impressed with his quick response to my emails. Made changes to lighten the load after March.
1976,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,1.0,3.0,"Nice guy, but not a great teacher. He knows his stuff, but has a hard time communicating information to students. I don't think that he is comfortable standing in front of class."

1978,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,1.0,2.0,I took this class online and I am not sure that the professor has experience teaching an online class. He was not organized and did not respond to emails. We did not know our grades until the very end of class.
1979,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,1.0,5.0,"I enjoyed the material but not the way that he taught. He knows his stuff but I don't think that he likes people,"
1980,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,So grateful to have taken him. Super accessible and gives great feedback. The class was also very interesting to take. Great Professor.

1983,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,5.0,2.0,"This Professor is a funny and entertaining one, he makes sure to make a subject such as sociology (which for some might be a boring one) a fun and interesting one. I'd highly recommend to take his course, he makes it easy to learn and there's not much study to do on your own if you simply pay attention to his lecture."
1984,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,5.0,3.0,"I took him this summer for syg2010. Great class, homework similar to other classes. Tests are not to difficult, just listen and take good notes."

1987,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,1.0,4.0,Lots of work and reading. Not a lot of interaction. He is very rigid and talks down to us.
1988,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2340,1.0,3.0,He is a nice guy but I am not sure what if anything I learned in the class. Lots of papers and reading and he likes to lecture but wont share his notes. I didnt feel as though I got my moneys worth and was really looking forward to taking sociology.

I feel terrible that people didn't get a chance to experience him. Love him. I would drive to north campus just to take him. Great lecturer and cares about his students. If u stay after class, he'll help you understand the material. Highly recommend"
1993,371501,Todd,Bernhardt,Broward College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,1.0,5.0,"My situation was similar to one I've just read, the teacher abandoned class just before it started and I only took this class to have him as one of my teachers. Disappointing to say the least."
1995,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,2.0,"I loved his class. Best professor i have ever had. You wont regret of having him for any of his classes, he will male sure you learn and have his knowledge for the rest of your life"
1996,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,4.0,1.0,"Definitely not a bad teacher very kind to us students.

1997,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2010,1.0,2.0,"I really regret choosing this professor for philosophy. I was told to take Kimber for it but this class fit into my schedule better so I chose this instead. If you truly want an interactive and inspirational philosophy class, DONT TAKE HIM. He just lectures every day and doesn't even ask his class for their opinions. Take someone else if you can!"
1998,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"Great classes, it's good to see someone that really likes what he does. Easy and fun class. The blended class was well organized, grading clear and an easy A"

2001,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI1100,3.0,5.0,"I struggled with this class. It reminded me a lot of math (which is not my strong point). Memorization is key in this class, unfortunately. The professor does give you many opportunities to gain points from extra credit assignments which helped me out a great deal. Read the syllabus carefully, he is very strict on word count for writing assignments"
2002,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,Dr. Oliveira is an amazing philosophy professor! He lectures through out the entire class however it is never boring! He makes the material interesting and it makes you want to learn more!

2003,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,2.0,He is one of the best professors I have come across. Always comes to class on time and teaches smoothly! Answers any question you may have and explains the various topics well. He truly knows his material! I took him for session 2 of summer 18. Assignments were clear and so fun to research. He also gives extra credit which is a bonus. Take him!
2004,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,2.0,"I am very glad I got to take his class. I HIGHLY suggest you pay attention to your word count for the assignments. One word can mean the difference between an A or B! I took his 6 week class and I did not find the amount of work overwhelming, in fact, it was easier to pace myself. I learned a lot and will use what I learned in the future."
2005,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,1.0,Loved his class ! Very easy as long as you pay attention in class and read his power points. He's very funny. You can miss 2 days of class and won't get penalized for it. After 2 days you get 10 points taken off your attendance (you start off at 100). TAKE HIM YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!! SUPER EASY CLASS. Learned a lot !
2006,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI1100,4.0,3.0,"The content of the work is hard to grasp , but he is a great professor. He gives extra credit. There are 3 exams and 9 quizzes, and 5 assignments. Not very hard but the info is hard to understand. My suggestion would be not to take a 6 week class because it is hard and too fast. Also, the quiz answers are on quizlet"
2007,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,2.0,"Overall very nice and respectful teacher always greets the class when we come in. Knows his subject very well and hes a doctor as well. Pretty chilled class reads off the powerpoints, and all of the assignments and tests are online, so this class was a breeze. Take his class if you want an EASY A !!!!!"
2008,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI1100,5.0,2.0,Easy class. Relaxed professor who will make the class enjoyable.
2009,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI1101,5.0,1.0,TAKE HIM! The man knows his stuff. The class is actually ver enjoyable.
2010,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI1100,4.0,1.0,"online quizzes, half of them were extra credit ones. super easy and the extra credit quizzes really help boost your grade. three online tests that were pretty easy as well. 5 assignments that were only need about 150-300 words basically a paragraph each assignment and they're simple, definitely recommend"
2011,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor! You will not only pass the class if you read and do the assignments, you will also learn things that will help you all your life!"
2012,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI2600,5.0,1.0,"I just finished my 8 weeks class with him. HE IS AMAZING. Everybody loves his lecture. He is so real and clear in his lecture. Don't be afraid to ask questions. I voted for him to be elected professor of year. In his class not only you will understand and pass it, but also you will learn stuff that you need  for your life."
2013,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI1100,5.0,2.0,The class was very well-structured. The online assignments and tests are not very hard if you read the printed notes in front of you. Prof. gives tons of extra credit so if you don't pass - It must be something wrong with you! Prof. Oliveira was extremely knowledgeable and funny. Strongly recommend this class for Computer Science and Prog majors.
2014,427108,Pedro,Oliveira,Broward College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI1100,5.0,2.0,"Pedro is a great professor if you have the chance to take a class with him, take it. you won't regret it. he is very passionate about what he teaches and he makes the class very easy."
2016,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,4.0,Professor Hennessy delivers information fluidly and is easy to listen to. Hes stern but caring. Excellent experience overall.
2017,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,5.0,2.0,"Very kind man, gives great feedback and isn't afraid to compliment students' work. Lots of reading material but it is a lit class after all. Reading selections were great, and gave lots of historical context to go with it. Take him if you have the chance!!!"
2018,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,LIT2020,5.0,2.0,"Lit2020 with Professor Hennessy was very straightforward. The class is very easy AS LONG as you make sure to read the short stories and stay on schedule. Each short story has quizzes that consist of 5 questions, if you read the quiz it should be a breeze. The class consists of 2 sets of critical summaries and a paper. Professor was very helpful!"
2019,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,1.0,5.0,"This is one of the worst classes I've have ever take, you have to read more than 20 pages to do only one attempt test with only 12 minutes to complete the test of 10 questions. He does not have considerations. It s almost impossible to get an A in this class."
2020,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,4.0,5.0,"had a 4.0 gpa, but i got a B, which is causing me to graduate with 3.96 ! this is the only class i got a B in lol. im a straight A student &amp; had an 88.9% in this class. I begged him can I do extra credit or anything to bring up my grade but he said NO. i was so devastated i cried. grades papers tough! beware of no rounding. ill never forget him"
2021,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Hennessey is great. I took a blended course so sometimes we only met up during his office hours. Professor David made us learn about real-world issues, was very informative, interactive with students, and was very easy to talk to. Grades very fairly. I thoroughly enjoyed this class."
2022,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,3.0,4.0,"Took this class online. Prof Henessey is a good professor! His class definitely isnt easy . Tons of reading. Discussions are mandatory, and quizzes on all the stories. As long as you participate and read you will definitely pass. He gives great feedback."
2023,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC101,5.0,2.0,"Great English teacher at Broward College. You only have to write three papers in the entire semester, and he gives you good one on one feedback during the rough draft portion so you can finalize your paper the best way possible. Highly recommend this teacher, he's really nice and respectable."
2024,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,2.0,"Simply amazing. Work is easy, merely have to put in effort to do the content assigned with it. Not hard just requires minimal amounts of dedication. Literally just attention/review content. Lively lectures, extra credit, fast grader, and helps revise essays. Took for ENC 1101, ENC 1102, and AML 2020 and am NOT good in this subject matter."
2025,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,5.0,2.0,"He's an amazing professor. Although some of the works of literature were difficult to understand, he made sure to go over the material so that it's understandable. Lots of quizzes, but they're easy if you've read the text. His lectures aren't boring and there are some funny jokes thrown in. Extra credit is offered."
2026,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2020,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor.
2027,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101ENC1102,5.0,2.0,"Best English professor you will ever have! He really cares about his students, and wants everyone to pass. He is really funny, gives good lectures, and is a down to earth guy. All that's graded in his class are 3 papers, mini quizes, attendance, and discussion posts which are very easy. I took him for ENC1101 and 1102, and got A's both semesters."
2028,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,3.0,5.0,"I chose him for my English class based on good comments that Ive seen on here , but turns out majority of the comments were actually WRONG�� If youre thinking about choosing him over someone else , CHANGE YOUR MIND AT THIS VERY MOMENT!"
2029,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,4.0,4.0,"He offers two extra credit assignments in quiz form. The lectures for the most part include a video version of the information. He will email you back faster than youd expect and is genuinely interested in your success. If the content feels overwhelming, break the reading up over a certain number of days, use an audiobook, and annotate."
2030,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2020,5.0,2.0,"Work is all online. Multiple quizzes, midterm, final, &amp; 1 research paper. He provides the short stories but you have to acquire the 2 novels yourself. Easy A If you put in the effort. Quizzes have relatively simple questions, but you do need to read the stories/have a basic understanding. Gave slight extra credit + entertaining lectures."
2031,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,5.0,2.0,Theres a lot of reading but nothing is too difficult to understand. A lot of discussions and quizzes but all of them are easy as long as you complete the readings. He is really quick to respond and is very understanding.
2032,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2020,5.0,2.0,"Reading material (usually short stories) was provided. LOADS of quizzes (online) w few questions. Actually read the stories, questions were VERY EASY but often specific. Gives extra credit. Had to read 2 short novels, do midterm + final (Online), &amp; write1 research paper. Follow rubrics and should get an A! Interesting &amp; hilarious lectures as well!"
2033,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,4.0,4.0,"This professor was great. I took the class online and he was very easy to get in contact with. The course is primarily reading, taking quizzes, and discussions. There are no assignments, which is great. If you dont do the reading you will fail, no doubt about it."
2034,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,AML2010,1.0,4.0,"Began as an easy going professor but it definitely didn't end that way. The quizzes have questions that you would think would be in the course, but they aren't. Great in communication. Just wish his class was better."
2035,1135177,David,Hennessy,Broward College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,1.0,I loved this professor. He's very knowledgeable in the subject and makes the class and work fun. I thought he was hilarious and looked forward to going to his class. His assignments were very easy and straightforward. I would take him as my professor for every class if I could.
2037,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,Be expected to teach yourself because she won't help guide you along the way. She has no patience for when you ask her questions and will make you feel insignificant. She is very lecture heavy and doesn't provide any extra credit or opportunities. She goes fast in her lecture as well. No feedback from her and quizzes during her lectures. Be warned.
2038,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,4.0,"If you are taking this class online, and if you make any kind of mistakes don't expect any sympathy from her. She doesn't go over how does the website works, so you better click on every tab because discussions, assignments and quizzes are everywhere. She didn't meet with the class at all. She was there merely to hit a button for the assignments"
2039,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"She was very heavy in her lectures, right after a test you would have to learn a new lesson. She didn't give any chance nor gave a final test so I could get my C at least. It was on the syllabus but she completely ignored it. I wouldn't recommend her."
2040,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,2.0,4.0,Pros-: Her syllabus is clear and to the point. Her syllabus is organized. She answered all of my emails and concerns. Con-: Lots of homework that barely impacts the grade percentage. 70% of her grade are proctored exams. The majority of the test questions were not up for review on the lectures or homework. No extra credit.
2041,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,You have to do your work and you would be fine. Tests are easy if you do your homework. She will help you out if you talk to her.
2042,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"I took prof Polyakova class for mac11105. it was great! she gives very clear instructions which are easy to follow. there is a lot of homework, but if you run into trouble and don't understand something, she' s super helpful. just be sure to come on time. Overall best professor i've had. two thumbs up!!!!!!"
2043,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,1.0,5.0,"The absolute worst math teacher I think I've ever had in my life. There was no learning material provided, just outdated videos of other professors who used calculators that we could not use, so the problems were done differently. You have to teach yourself, I get good grades but the exams were hard and I failed each one. Study guide does not help"
2044,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,3.0,"Just like any other math class you have to study. Homework was the objectives on ALEKS and we just have quizzes every other week. As long as you show up quiz days and do good on them and do the homework assigned you should be good. I saw a lot of people mention her accent but to me is was easy to understand, she's also nice."
2045,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,3.0,Aite:/
2046,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,4.0,The way she grades is a bit complicated.
2047,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,5.0,I like this class and I like her as a teacher. This is the hardest class Ive took yet but I have a good grade so far. If youre a person who misses classes or come late often you shouldnt take this class because it will be hard for you to catch up. Cheating wont do you any justice either. As long as u pay attention and study youll be fine.
2048,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,One of the best Math teachers I've taken. It was a 6 week course which is really fast.  You had to put your all into it but she taught really good and it was worth it in the end. Her grading was quite understanding. Not that many tests or quizzes... She has an accent but that's fine with me. I advise you to take her class!!!!!!!
2049,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,4.0,She's a really good teacher. She tells you what she expects and her classwork isn't all that difficult if you pay attention and go to class.
2050,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,4.0,"I dropped this class because it moved to fast for me. before I had the chance to understand something, she moved on to the next thing. the majority of the grades are quizzes and tests so there isn't much feedback from her. I don't think she was a bad teacher I just think I didn't fit her teaching style."
2051,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,5.0,"THIS WAS THE HARDEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN!! NOT BECAUSE MATH IS A DIFFICULT SUBJECT, BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IN THE WORLD TO UNDERSTAND HER EXTREMELY HEAVY HEAVY ACCENT!   SHE DOSE NOT GO BACK AND ONLY EXPLAINS PROBLEMS TYPES ONCE.  IF YOU DONT WANT YOUR GPA RUINED, THIS IS YOUR WARNING, BEWARE!"
2052,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,4.0,4.0,"Let me start by saying that I am not good at math, at all. Took MAC1140 as an online class since it was the only way it would fit into my schedule. There is definitely a good chunk of work that needs to be done. But Professor Polyakova was more than helpful from the start. Ended up with a B in the class, which was more than fine with me."
2053,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,4.0,"I took Pre-Calc as a 12 week summer course.  Prof Polyakova is an excellent Professor.  One of the most organized that I have taken.  You will always know what to do and what is coming up.  She also provides weekly summaries of what to do.  If you have question, you have to ask her.  She will respond in detail.  Discussions.  Quizzes, and 3 Tests."
2054,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,4.0,She's is a very good teacher who clearly knows the material she is teaching. You get your attendance based on the classwork so if you don't do the classwork it is like you're absent. The homework assignments are tedious (ALEC) but it definitely helps you understand the course. Test are easy if you do the homework and listen in class.
2055,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"IF YOU DONT LIKE THE ALEKS PROGRAM, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! It even has a warning when you signup, that she teaches with ALEKs. For those who don't know what ALEK is, it's homework x1,000 every week.... Aside from that she is nice. If she didn't teach with Aleks then this class would have been perfect because she explains well and cares."
2056,500444,Marina,Polyakova,Broward College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,1.0,3.0,"I wish I listened to the other people. She doesn't respond most of the time, class room is insane, and no extra credit!!!!"
2058,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,4.0,4.0,"Professor Sahagun is a tough teacher, but caring. She can be a little snappy at times, but that is because she is passionate about her students learning Spanish. I really enjoyed being in her class, she has a sense of humor as well. There is a verbal and written test after each chapter, so pay attention to her lectures and you will do fine."
2059,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1121,1.0,5.0,"This professor is very test heavy, she likes to do verbal tests through the camera and takes off points for everything even though she sees you trying, this class was very difficult, I had no regrets withdrawing."
2060,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,BEGSPANISH1,2.0,3.0,"She has an attitude to her, it can be interpreted as good or bad depending on what side you're on with her. she defiantly feels like she is infiluable in herself and doesn't admit her mistakes. i have had good and bad experiences with her"
2061,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1101,5.0,2.0,Here I am writing this review years after graduating from college. This professor was EASILY the most caring professor i've ever had in my life. She definitely made the class feel like a second home and she was the mother. She cared about everyone in the classroom and made everyone feel welcome. She was always so nice to my sister and I.
2062,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,4.0,4.0,"Professor Sahagun was fun and creative but tough. Took her class online due to COVID19 but she made us feel like we were in person. She made sure that everyone understood the material even though it came out a little harsh, she tells it like it is. She will recognize if you're trying or not. Do your hw daily except the day before a test and STUDY!!"
2063,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,4.0,2.0,"Very good professor! As long as you PAY ATTENTION!! , ask questions, and do the homework she really looks out for you. Spanish can be difficult, but she is able to break it down easily so even the non spanish speakers understand. Graded by 6 quizzes, final (easy), 1 presentation, and connect. Take her. Youll learn alot without feeling overwhelmed."
2064,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor! Makes sure you know the concept and really helps you get your money's worth. Explains everything in-depth and gives you hints on how to answer when you're asked to answer a question.
2065,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1121,3.0,4.0,Not a bad professor very fair but you know who her had favorite students were. I know i wasnt the best student in her class because i was slacking. And she tried her best to understand my problems and help me. I pass her class. She try her best to help you learn Spanish. She is very friendly. Not a bad professor!
2066,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,5.0,2.0,"Profe was absolutely amazing when it came to teaching me Spanish.

2074,502316,Claudia,Sahagun,Broward College (all campuses),Languages,SPN1120,2.0,5.0,"She is a nice person, thats not a question. But for a beginner course, she is teaching just like you have been talking spanish your whole life. Her class is very hard, I would take it if you already have good knowledge in spanish."

2083,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,1.0,4.0,This professor is by far the most conceited at Broward college. SHE SPEAKS SO FAST to the point where if you get lost and ask she puts you on blast in front of the class. Participation is heavy in her class too so if you don't know the correct answer you're punished by being belittled in the class.
2084,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,4.0,3.0,"You have to show up to learn the materials. I honestly recommend doing well on cengage and participation points. 5 tests but drops the lowest grade, cengage hw, &amp; participation points Q given during class. I got 3 Bs &amp; 1 A on the test. And yet, I have an A in class. Not very easy, but doable. Study the powerpoint esp the problems/journal entry etc."
2085,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACCT2001,1.0,5.0,Forget these other comments. This professor is very conceited and does not teach properly. She feels it is ok to teach a chapter one class before the test. If you want to contact her good luck. She will get upset if you don't understand the material. Is not prepared for class and does not let you know when class is cancelled. So be prepared.
2086,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG1102,4.0,3.0,"I took Accounting 1 and 2 in class with her, she knows her stuff to the highest degree but she lectures fast. I took most of my notes from the ""Show me How"" tap on Cengage and online Power Points. But she always stopped and answered any questions, I also didn't mind her teaching style although I heard a few students say they preferred her sister."
2087,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,3.0,Ms. M is amazing. She cares about her students getting A's and gives us all the tools to do well. You can tell she really likes accounting and tries to get everyone excited about it as well. Study for tests and show up to class because she gives out participation/ EC points sometimes.
2088,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACC12,5.0,3.0,nice
2089,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2071,5.0,4.0,Very entertaining class. Accounting can get boring but Prof. M keeps it lit with her outgoing personality. You go to class solely for the lecture. All graded work is on cengage. She gives a few EC opportunities(must attend class to hear about it. Grading is clear. Defiantly recommend taking her class.
2090,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,4.0,"She is the best accounting teacher to take if you actually want to learn. I took her for Accounting 1, 2, and 3. She goes fast but is always asking if anyone has questions. The homework is a little tricky to figure out at first so I recommend trying to make a friend to do the homework with in the beginning. She loves accounting."
2091,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,3.0,An AMAZING professor. I came in to Accounting 1 terrified and she took all of that fear away. She dedicates her time to making sure every last student understands the material. There's four tests and an optional final as a replacement for a bad test grade or grade booster. She's super funny and has an all around great personality. Highly recommend.
2092,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACCOUNTING1,5.0,4.0,"I TOOK THIS CLASS ON ACCIDENT!!! I'm so glad I did to tell you that Professor Montesarchio is AMAZING!!! She goes above and BEYOND for every student. She truly cares and will meet after class for any futher questions. She wants you to understand the material and WANTS YOU TO PASS!!! However, studying is key!!"
2093,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,2.0,"I love this professor! im gonna take her again for ACG2011, and ACG2071. TAKE HER! Homework is okay, 4 tests, and some extra credit"
2094,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,5.0,4.0,"I adore Dr. M! The rumors are true, the class is fast paced. BUT she's one of those rare profs that actually teaches. She has everyone pull out paper &amp; she walks around to make sure you're getting it. There are 5 tests (not hard) &amp; the lowest grade is dropped. They make up 70% of your final grade, the other 30% is the Cengage HW. Highly recommend."
2095,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACG2001,4.0,4.0,"Love her but accounting really isn't my thing. I struggled for a B but then again I didn't read as much as I should've. READ THE BOOK. It's boring but read it, please."
2096,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACCT2071,5.0,3.0,"Take her, she makes sure you understand the material and she'll help you if you need to on the homework questions. She talks fast and goes quick through the powerpoints but its all posted online so that was not an issue. There's lots of homework but you'll have that in any accounting class as all use Cengage. Took her for all three ACG classes."
2097,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,ACCT2001,4.0,4.0,A lot of work in Cengage. And I mean a lot.  Majority of your grade is based in Cengage so do the work.  Read all of the examples and do exercises.
2098,484141,Cathileen,Montesarchio,Broward College (all campuses),Business,MKA2949,5.0,1.0,"I just finished MKA2949 - Marketing internship, and my supervisor was Professor Montesarchio. She is really caring and a nice person. She provides informative feedbacks. When I had questions, I could call or write to her, and she helped me with any questions. I'd love to take one of her classes yet. Highly recommend!"
2100,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,4.0,2.0,Michael is an amazing professor - his lectures are very informative and gives a greater understanding of what was said in the book as well as providing supplementary videos with his slides. He's very caring of his students and accommodates for any circumstance.
2101,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"DR Bakst is a great teacher. His lectures are interesting because he makes jokes during them. He gives extra credit by just participation, the credit helps at the end in case you are facing a failing grade. If Mr Bakst see that you are trying, he will show you love. 2 tests, 1 final, a group project and review homework assignments that are easy."
2102,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,3.0,2.0,"Prof. Bakst has an eccentric personality for sure. The grading scale is a little confusing. The textbook will be a big help for homework, but otherwise, the test's content will not reflect ANY of the information taught through the textbook or in class. Participation will definitely help you get through the class."
2103,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,2.0,He's very funny and likes to let students speak and ask questions. It's important to try and participate as you can get a lot of extra credit too. Weekly homework was simple and just two exams and a group project. I would not recommend skipping his class though and he does not accept late work.
2104,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"First of all, he's HILARIOUS. His class is amazing, and you can tell he's extremely knowledgeable in his field. The midterm and final are online, not timed, and open book. One group project, about a dozen easy homework assignments, and gives out extra credit cards for participation. You cannot go wrong in choosing this professor."
2105,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Bakst is seriously funny, and makes class very enjoyable. All homework is based off the textbook, but not hard as long as you do the readings. Only two exams, which were both take home and open book. Gives very important notes in class, and extra credit for perfect attendance. Willingly to meet with you outside of class to help."
2106,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor! Grades and timeline of when everything was due was clear. His lectures were always interesting and he is hilarious with his cheesy jokes.
2107,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,2.0,"Had his summer Psy101 class and it was great! Purpose of the class was not to test/trick you, but to foster an interest in psychology. He makes typical corny professor jokes, but is very knowledgeable in his field since he's a retired clinical psychologist. Homework every day due the next week, both midterm and final were open note + online."
2108,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,2.0,HE IS AMAZING. take him. you won't regret it. he is one of the best professor I've ever met
2109,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,5.0,3.0,One of the best teachers I've had in a long time. His lectures keep you interested and he doesn't teach anything you'd wanna forget. One of my favorite professors if not the favorite and I'll miss taking his class dearly!
2110,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bakst is a great instructor! His jokes are extensive and funny, but can be a bit much. He offers extra credit just for participating. His homework is just to show him that you understand the material. There is one group project towards the end of the course and its an easy presentation. I recommend this prof. to any everyone."
2111,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,2.0,"The lectures were pretty interesting, Prof. Bakst made the class fun. The class was easy for the most part, just homework due every week for the chapter, two open note exams, and one group presentation at the end of the semester."
2112,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"Lectures pretty much the entire class. He doesn't spend much time on each slide so it's hard to take notes in class unless you have the powerpoint open on your computer. There's only one homework assignment per week, 2-3 q, 2/3 of a page each q. 2 open book exams on canvas. 1 group project, doesn't post grades. Lots of extra credit opportunities"
2113,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"Professor Bakst is brilliant. His lectures are mind opening. There is homework every week, three questions based on the reading of the chapter. Two exams that are open book and are done on canvas. A group research presentation towards the end of the semester. It is very easy to earn an A if you do all the homework and do well on the both exams."
2114,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,2.0,Attendancemandatory. Hw once a week. Doesnt put grades up though. Open book exams.
2115,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,3.0,"I'm still taking this class, I was going through hard times when I start taking this class like depression and anxiety and I learn a lot about it and how deal with it. Professor Michael is a great person. Is also a super interesting class you wont fall asleep. You will love it and you wont regret."
2116,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,MHDD123,1.0,3.0,"I took this online class so I have enough time for assignments,tests, etc. I emailed him and he didn't give me the time I needed. He makes you check the schedule and you don't get any notifications like you do with your other classes on canvas. If you have a busy life I do not recommend he doesn't care to help you with your problems."
2117,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,2.0,"Easy A. Mid and final are open book that really helps alot! One research project that you have to do as a group, ( In my opinion I think that's annoying. I'm used to working alone lol. ) and you have weekly HW from the book. Yes he a great professor in his field. However, I don't think he is funny. He tries way to hard to be funny. lol"
2118,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,3.0,"He is such a great teacher! All of his test are pretty easya nd they are well taught, he gives you a fair amount of time and is great if you need help!"
2119,1067444,Michael,Bakst,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Bakst is very knowledgeable in his field, very professional also. He ensures you will pass his class with clear understanding of the subject. Not only he is serious about his field, he is hilarious - tells good jokes! I highly recommend his class. TAKE HIM!"
2121,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,4.0,4.0,Took her for 223 &amp; I'm taking her for 224 right now. She bases her exams off of her PPts so study them real hard! I had a study buddy &amp; we would ask each other questions off the slides. No mandatory zoom meetings so you can do the notes at your own pace as she posts them &amp; 5 exams w the cumulative final! Not a hard professor but you have to study!
2122,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,AP224,4.0,4.0,"Take her, shes awesome and sweet outside class. I would take her again If I could :-)"
2123,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,AP224,3.0,4.0,"Shes an awesome professor, no books needed, study pp upside down"
2124,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,4.0,5.0,"I had her for both 223 and 224. 223 was definitely a lot easier, but 224 was so difficult! Shannon is amazing and everything on her powerpoints will be on the exam! Make sure you memorize the powerpoints word for word. 224 is no joke but she makes it manageable!"
2125,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,AP224,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE her class!!! she makes the class very boring, does not give examples to remember stuff, all test are super hard and tricky, not caring at all, chapter assignments are hard. Her favorite words are"" I don't care and you have to apply it"". every test gets harder and harder and the final is a killer (comprehensive test and again tricky)"
2126,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,5.0,3.0,"Forget all these other reviews. I retook BIO 223 &amp; 224 at the SAME TIME this semester, both under Professor Larson. She gives out powerpoints &amp; study guides (which correlate exactly to the exam!). BIO is a hard course but just go to class, study PPTs, and you'll be fine. 4 Exams 1 Final. Didn't use the book! If I got A's in both, any student can."
2127,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,1.0,5.0,"Dont to take her, her exams are overwhelming! 90 questions each exam and her final is comprehensive. Took her class for spring 2020 and the whole virus situation was going on, her online exams were extra harder and overwhelming."
2128,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,4.0,2.0,I took Professor Larson for an online class and she was amazing. Whenever I had a question she would get back to me within a couple of hours of emailing her. She provides useful slides and as long as you read the textbook and study you should pass with an A no problem. I would definitely recommend the online class!
2129,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,4.0,2.0,"Easy class if you just do the work. The labs are easy you just have to read through them really well and make sure your work is right. The worst part was making the figures for the labs, they weren't hard, just tedious."
2130,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,5.0,3.0,She is AMAZING. Makes biology understandable and bearable. Seriously she is the best! You dont need the book. Everything is off her powerpoints (which are not too much at all). Study and youll do fine! Wish I had taken her for 223 as well.
2131,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,1.0,5.0,"If you like to just memorize PP literally down to each word and understand it on your own, this is for you. She uses real life scenarios Test to ask questions and will Give you 5 choices all were you cant really do process of elimination. IVE SEEN OTHER prof. Notes &amp; REVIEWS and this puts her 2 shame! U will nvr use the book she encourages not 2."
2132,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,3.0,4.0,I really do like Professor Larson but I learn by the prof expanding on the topics. Her PP has everything you need to know and you really don't have to understand the subject or attend class to get a good grade. Just memorize the tiny details on each slide and recall them on the exam. I didn't really learn much and I feel behind in 224 now.
2133,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,5.0,4.0,"Larson gives out study guides and numerous other tools for exams to help you do well. No trick questions on exams; very straight forward. I like that she paces herself by writing on the board so you're not scrambling to take notes and you're able to absorb info. Take her! A&amp;P is not easy, work for your grade. STUDY STUDY STUDY!!"
2134,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,5.0,5.0,Absolutely love Professor Larson! Definitely not an easy class because she makes you work for you grade but no anatomy class is easy. Everything on the powerpoints are on the exams so STUDY. Exam 3 is her hardest exam. I'm going to take her for 224 because she is that good! TAKE HER!
2135,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,5.0,4.0,One of the best instructors here at CSN. I don't agree with some of the comments here. Larson's lecture are literally her exams. No tricky questions! She is just straight to the point. Not like the others who teach unnecessary/heavy lectures. Larson understand that this class is already hard. Students just don't know how to study.
2136,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,1.0,4.0,"I do not recommend Larson, she read exactly what is on the slides and write exaclty on the white board. I asked questions and she is not liking to be question, she doesnt explain further the lecture. Test is tough, very different with the lecture. I watched a lot of youtube to understand the lectures. I honestly dont recommend her teaching style."
2137,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223224,5.0,4.0,"I do not recommend C. Milne cuz hes way too tough. But Larson Is a saint. Bio is hard, but she made it manageable and understandable. Exams are challenging, but doeable. She can be rather rash and aggressive on the outside. But shes really sweet on the inside. And also helpful. Shes honestly one of the best professors I ever had in school."
2138,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,5.0,3.0,"Prof Larson lectures straight off her power points and tests are all info from power points. Crossword puzzles and study guides are SO HELPFUL! I barely cracked the book once and got a 96% for the class. All her tests are very straight forward- no trick questions. Final had like 3 questions that were ""What day is today?"" type questions! She rocks!"
2139,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,AP224,1.0,5.0,Nothing but trick question and gotcha moments. No substance to her lectures.
2140,832121,Shannon,Larson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,5.0,4.0,"I enjoyed her class, it was pretty straight forward. She makes what she wants you to know for exams clear and gives you extra study material for not just lecture but lab as well. The exams are based off her powerpoints but you have to attend class to get all the information. The book isn't necessary but it's helpful when studying."
2142,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,"Matt is a great professor! I wish he taught all the bio classes I need. I would definitely take him again! He has a way of breaking down complex information in a way thats more understandable. I learned a lot in this class. There were 4 exams, exam recovery, online assignments, and iclicker points. Attendance is important for notes."
2143,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,4.0,3.0,"He's a great prof, they way he explains material made it easier to retain. He wants you to apply the info so his exams can be challenging. He doesn't teach out of the textbook so show up to class to keep up. I rated him at a 4 instead of 5 because we were behind most of the semester and he really dropped the ball after we transitioned online."
2144,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,4.0,On the first day of class i regretted signing up for him. He talks a lot &amp; it's always useless info. Going to online due to Covid made the class worse. He posted 2-3 hour long recordings and had workbooks to go along with them. It took the whole semester to grade 1 assignment. He is still giving out new material and the semester ends next Friday.
2145,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,I highly recommend this teacher! He has a knack for explaining complex material in a way you can truly understand and learn. He has lots of material online to help you learn as well. He also has exam recovery which gives you a chance to recover points from exams you missed. Hes a great teacher. I wish he could teach all my bio classes!
2146,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"Take CHEM 103 prior to this class. Four exams, three exam recovery, online homework assignments, online quizzes, and iClicker participation questions. Will not test you on information he does not cover in class. Amazing at breaking down complex information. Everything based on his lectures/powerpoints. Studied 3-4 hrs/wk. Highly recommend!"
2147,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,Great professor!!! He says the textbook doesnt make sense no need for one. Everything is on his notes but you need to present for them b/c he only has the outlines online. Easy online quiz each week but you have 3 attempts. 4 exams and test corrections for first 3. Humor is blunt but funny. Makes bio a lil less stressful than youd think.
2148,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,As someone who has taken bio 189 before let me just say this HE IS AMAZING. He is so knowledgable and BLUNT. TAKE HIM! He makes things so easy to understand and actually enjoys being in the class room. No need for the book but if you feel like you need another resource go ahead. I clicker is used and making it to class should be a priority .
2149,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"I'am so happy I had Matthew Mahrt for Bio 189. Honest to God great teacher. He has been doing this forever, and puts everything in a way you can understand. No need to get the textbook, he goes off his power points. His lectures are amazing, and keeps you wanting to hear more:)"
2150,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"If you want to pass Bio 189 the first time please get Professor Matt, he is worth the wait even if his class is booked up then take him next semester and don't waste your money on another professor. This is my third attempt trust me i know. A book isn't mandatory in his lecture, he gives good feed back and teaches in a way that you understand."
2151,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"Matt is an amazing professor! Although this class was tough, Matt had a way of breaking down complex terms into simpler ones to make sure that we understood what he was teaching. He did not use a textbook but did use an I-clicker. Attendance isn't mandatory, however I recommend attending all his lectures to keep up with class."
2152,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"Mahrt is a really good prof. I worked 7 days/week, took his class at night, (missed a few) but I still got a B because his lectures are amazing and I learned a lot. He lets you ask questions and discuss. His class and grading was organized. He has truly mastered the class which I respect. If youre a Christian, just brush off what he says sometimes."
2153,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"MAHRT HAS MASTERED THE ART OF 189! Print out his powerpoints, take notes as he goes -- and you're golden! Clear grading criteria. Exams are challenging -- but easy points for online quizzes, 30 points for iclicker participation, and offers optional extra credit by doing exam recovery on questions you missed. Online final. Easy A if you just TRY!!!"
2154,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,"Do the work and study a lot for the exams. Ask him questions, he seems rude but he wants to help."
2155,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"He is amazing!! extremely knowledgeable on all the material! Most classes you can memorize things YOU CAN NOT DO IT IN THIS CLASS. You have to learn the material and understand it to pass the tests. Read the chapter, watch the videos he provides online, do the practice tests and you will be fine!"
2156,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor. I'd definitely recommend him. Tones of knowledge and he knows exactly how to put it in a way his students understand.
2157,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,1.0,"I got an accident a day before 3rd exam and he totally give me a change to recover what I lost in the exam. The best instructor that I ever have in my college school. Take him, Thanks a lot professor!!!! your the best..."
2158,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,Great teacher! He is very knowledgeable about what he teaches. Notes are outlined in the powerpoint he provides on canvas. Go to class everyday even though it is not mandatory. He relates all info to subjects we understand and it makes this class easy. Use the online material he provides. Homework is easy points. Tests are not comprehensive.
2159,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Like others before me said, he has a great way of turning hard concepts into easy to understand concepts. Everything you need to know for the exams are in his lectures, practice quizzes, and homework. He gives you all the tools to succeed just make sure to show up to class and listen in on his lectures. There is no real need for the book."
2160,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,1.0,"Amazing teacher! Grade is based on HW, iclickers, tests &amp; final. Do the online practice quizzes/vocab, as some questions from there will be on tests. Record lectures as well for same reason. He truly cares about his student's success, and has a way of teaching difficult concepts into simpler ones. I wish he could teach BIO 223/224."
2161,1206342,Matthew,Mahrt,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,4.0,1.0,"Best professor. I highly recommend, 4 exam and final through canvas not hard, I highly recommend .don't need a textbook but I take a note and record his voice. I'm always be the last to finished every exam but I let you know his exam is not even hard at all. He don't waste your time he wants everybody to succeed and explain the lecture right."
2163,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,1.0,3.0,"If you plan on taking Mulholland for an online class, don't. He doesn't give good feedback at all, doesn't answer student emails, doesn't give notes, and takes forever to grade. He allows revisions but doesn't specify what to revise. His instructions are unclear. His class was disappointing, especially after seeing the great reviews."
2164,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,2.0,4.0,"Don't understand why his rating is so high. He makes you participate every class and does not give clear feedback whatsoever. He will make you define words like ""good"" just to be a jerk. Took him when COVID took over and he was even worse online."
2165,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,2.0,2.0,"I'm only speaking for online classes, but this is probably one of the worst professors that I've ever had concerning feedback and clarity. Professor Mulholland does not respond to any student emails, he takes millennia to grade essays, and he does not keep students updated on anything. The only upside to this class is that the syllabus is easy."
2166,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,4.0,3.0,"The 4-week online class consists of 4 essays, a timed blue book essay, and a short show and tell assignment. My best advice is to include as many stages and archetypes in each essay as you can. He really looks for a strong thesis so make sure to follow his essay structure. The movies are fun to watch too."
2167,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,4.0,Professor Mullholand is just awesome. Yes his class requires lots of reading and writing papers but nothing that is above a college level class. His main goal is to make his students expand their minds and start thinking. He makes you question things and ask questions and of course he knows a stupid question when he hears one and doesn' like them.
2168,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,2.0,4.0,"Not clear on feedbacks. So I do the same mistake over and over again. First hour of the class was usually spent watching films, and then he discussed. He is not very clear what he wants on essay because he wants your creativity. I went through sleepless nights whenever he posts an essay. But it wont be hard if you love reading and can write easily"
2169,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,3.0,5.0,"Literally watched movies EVERY class of the semester. Not clear lectures on archetypes. I had to study and find resources outside of class to understand his class. 4 essays, 1 blue book exam. Not clear feedback. He seems all over the place. He is funny and entertaining. inspirational. When it comes to the material, it was difficult to understand."
2170,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,4.0,4.0,"As a person he's really amazing and can make the whole class laugh. As a teacher however, he's strange. There's only 4 papers and a blue book so there isn't much homework throughout the year but the papers are very difficult and broad. He doesn't expect it to be perfect the first time but it's incredibly difficult to get clear feedback."
2171,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,Professor Mulholland is one of those professors that makes you participate for a good purpose is to hear everyone's ideas/views and opinions. Also he gets everyone interested in the class by expanding our horizons so we learn new stuff every class which is awesome. I was thinking that english 223 was going to be hard but it was easy
2172,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I have had hands down, I have taken him for two semesters in a row now (102 and 223 monsters) and he is just really amazing! Class is mainly discussion based and if you just listen to his critiques on your essays its easy to pass :-) his classes are truly great so I highly suggest taking him for any english course"
2173,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Mulholland is great, his classes are spent watching movies and recognizing the Hero's journey in ea. movie as well and the Archetypes. 4 essays for hm, 1 essay in class and 1 short presentation. His class shows you how to perceive life more than just the superficial, I won't ever watch movies the same, something in you changes after his class"
2174,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mulholland is a unique individual, I really enjoyed our class discussions. He does not say that he takes attendance, but I am sure, he notes who shows up. You have few assignments, but he is a tough grader. We had four essays for this class."
2175,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,4.0,4.0,"I took his English 102 class and decided he was easy and friendly enough for another semester. He's way better this time around. Monster lit. gives him the ability to be more creative in what he talks about and he is very opinionated. He swears a lot and is not subtle in the way he thinks, but he's very smart and open-minded."
2176,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,5.0,4.0,"Professor MulHolland is on a mission to teach his students to critically think, ask good questions, get to the point, and is successful in doing so. I took 101 with him also and each class was very interactive. Although a bit rough around the edges, it is clear he sincerely wants for his students success."
2177,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,4.0,3.0,"Alright, for the most part this dude is alright. If you want to learn something, this dude is it. However, if you want to get an A, you'll really have to work for it. He also really loves asking you and your classmates questions about what you've learned. His class isn't for the faint of heart, or easily intimidated. We also tend to watch movies."
2178,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,4.0,4.0,This professor is very strict on thesis if your thesis isnt good he will make you redo it until he likes it. He comes off as mean but he really isnt. You learn a lot from his class and he isnt scared to say what hes thinking. If you want an A probably dont take him but if you want to learn something id recommend him.
2179,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Mulholland's literature of love class, his teaching style is unorthodox. He helps you become a critical thinker by teaching you how to question topics on a deeper level. His class discussions are unique and interesting, and his writing assignments can be hard if you cannot grasp the concepts from the class discussions."
2180,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,4.0,4.0,"Took this class over the summer. It was one assignment after another. He is not your average professor. He really makes you think and have a different perspective on life. He might be a hard pill to swallow at first but eventually grows on you. I really enjoyed his class. If I could I would take it again. Yet, this class is not for everyone."
2181,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,"I loved Prof. MulHolland. He has a very intricate way of teaching. 5 essays, and 2 books. You will not get an easy A in this class, he makes you work for it. Attendance isn't mandatory, but I highly recommend going to as much classes as you can or make some friends in class so you know what to expect on the next. Be prepared to ask questions!"
2182,545157,Anthony,Mulholland,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223PSYCH,5.0,1.0,This professor is caring he makes sure that if you need help he will help you. He cares about time and start class right away. Focus on your thesis and make sure prompt connects to your papers because he emphasizes that a lot in class. He is funny and I like the fact to learn how drugs effects people in this psychedelic literature summer class. :)
2184,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,3.0,"I didn't learn anything. Textbook is required which you rarely use. Her made up ""workbook"" required which is useless. You are on your own. All she did was post all the lectures. That's it. If you ask her about assignments, she's no help at all. She won't explain what you did wrong or sometimes not reply at all. Dont take her!!"
2185,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,1.0,"I never write reviews about about any professors, but this professor is the worst of the worst. She is only rude, but also means. She is very irresponsible and unprofessional. She doesnt teach you AT ALL. You just read the book and learn whatever you learn and do her exercises. Avoid at All COSTS! pls!"
2186,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,4.0,"There wasnt much interaction with her, just make sure you read the instructions a few times and do everything on time. She also drops your lowest test grade which helped a lot."
2187,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,5.0,"I would suggest you to please stay away from this teacher. Please(10x). Rude, very disorganized, and lack communication skills."

Extremely rude and does not teach anything"
2189,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,3.0,Id take anyone else. Youre on your own in this online class. Little to no involvement with students. Feedback on assignments/questions is either non existent or extremely limited. Assignments are vague and reply's received are rather short and in a condescending manner. The workbook only has 3 assignments that you can easily get from the library.
2190,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,3.0,"First of all, this professor was the rudest and most unhelpful professor that I've ever had. She was very rude whenever you asked for a question and then made you feel stupid for even asking."
2191,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,5.0,"I wish I looked her up on here before i started her class. Worse teacher ever. She gives unclear directions to her work, you get like few assignments and sometimes none at all before the chapter test. She is a very lazy grader and a very harsh one at it too for someone who takes their sweet time to grade. It's impossible to understand her."
2192,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,5.0,"Worst class I've ever taken online. Two ""assignments"" before exam 1, nothing due for 2 weeks- 2nd exam, then nothing again for 2 weeks and a 3rd exam? then suddenly 5 assignments all due in the last month of class? Complete mess, no flow of work to keep you engaged and learn anything. Grades extremely hard, was excited to take Psych, she ruined it."
2193,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,5.0,"Great professor! I Loved all the knowledge you acquire in this class. If I could do it all over again, I would not take the summer course, (4 WEEKS). You must read two chapters a week and do your assignments. More than likely you are also taking other classes as well. It is a bit too much when you have a busy life as it."

2195,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY233,1.0,5.0,"Coming from a student with a 3.8 GPA, I received a C in this class and found it to be very challenging, not because of the subject itself, but because of how she ""taught"" this class and her unclear instructions. There was not a traditional textbook, but a workbook that we used *sometimes* and then she gave unclear notes. Would not recommend!!!"
2196,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,5.0,"I wish I would've looked at rate my professor before I picked this class. The professor talks about herself frequently and is always off topic. She does not explain what she is talking about and gets angry when you ask her to clarify. She skips through the workbook, you're lucky if you could keep up with her to get all of the definitions."
2197,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,1.0,5.0,"Don't take this professor!!! She is HORRIBLE. The worst I've literally ever had. I was on my phone in the hallway before class and she yelled out a snide remark about me being on my phone. She doesn't lecture, all she does is talk about her former students, and random ramblings about various topics. Oh, btw, she makes you BUY her lecture notes!!"
2198,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,4.0,"Take good notes, because the class is judged by tests and attendance. Dr. Sala gives multiple small extra credit assignments. She does talk softly or in vague terms, but ask questions. She will clarify herself. No textbook, just a packet of notes, but know your notes because the tests are multiple choice. Make sure to understand the concepts."
2199,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,2.0,4.0,"Shes a tough grader in a sense that she does not make it clear what she wants done on an assignment. If you want something specific done, write it in the instructions. Shes expecting you to figure out what shes thinking. Were not in your mind. We dont know what youre thinking."
2200,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,4.0,She throws workbook work at you with VERY vague instructions. Its teaching at all... I would not recommend
2201,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,The class was a 4 week course over the summer. It's not difficult as long as you pay attention to her assignment due dates and the quizzes aren't hard. She's also quick to respond via CSN email whenever I had a question.
2202,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,2.0,All her quizzes are online just look them up and you'll pass. Easy A class everyone is a hater. She only has a few assignments. I recommend taking this course online.
2203,212418,Angela,La Sala,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,5.0,"She makes you feel stupid when you ask a question, as if you are a bother to her. Her ""textbook"" is a joke. She skips things on the test. She skips around and goes off topic. She is late and then lectures us on being on time. I wish I had never enrolled in her class and seen the reviews beforehand. Her class is purely pass or fail and most fail."
2204,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL197,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!! he is the worst ever. he expects you know everything and when you don't know something he doesn't even try to help you. he will tell you to study hard or you will fail his class and he doesn't even care about his students at all! he's a very rude person too and gets frustrated easily
2205,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO1107,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Parker is a good professor.  I took in summer 2013 and I enjoyed his Principles of Biology class.  He knows the info can get tough and he was very helpful.  Hey, people if you want to work hard go some place else. He knows who is trying and who wants a donation!"
2206,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,2.0,5.0,"I took this guy for 3 days and walked out of his class! He is extremely rude and egotistical. He made some lil' girl cry for asking a question, so I left and told him that he was a joke. Anyway, I walked over and was lucky enough to get into Dr. Kimberleys lecture. Got an A. I gave you fair warning."
2207,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,he thinks he smarter than anybody
2208,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL113,2.0,5.0,"Take a different teacher! Ya, he is full of knowledge and loves biol; but, he seems to get off on making things difficult. You might be an A student &amp; study hard and still fail his tests. What's the point in making things so difficult for yourself? Head all the advice, Take Another Teacher and Call It A Day! (He even brags about students failing)"
2209,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1151,1.0,5.0,"He is not a good professor.  His understanding in this subject is not very clear to be a Dr. in this profession.  He is very short-tempered to avoid questions asked by the students.  Study guides are not required by professors, but if you think you are going to get help from him----you are sadly mistakened!!!!"
2210,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO1151,1.0,5.0,VERY RUDE AND NOT HELPFUL TO STUDENTS AT ALL.
2211,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.5,5.0,"He is a horrible professor. When you ask him for help he gives you answers like, ""study and you'll be fine."" But thats his answer to everything. He's rude and just reads powerpoints. Thats it. He doesn't elaborate on anything. The only good thing is that he is incredibly hot. But other than 80 minutes of eye candy, the class was worthless."
2212,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Regardless of who your instructor is this is a hard class! I think Parker is an excellent instructor. You will do well as long as you listen and record his lectures, read the book and be able to apply the knowledge. His test questions may seem hard if you don't understand the information but if you take the time to study you will be fine."
2213,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Parker is very knowledgable but expects a lot from students.  His test are very difficult, at a level of a colleauge not a student."
2214,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,4.0,5.0,"Fun and engaging lectures but to do well you must attend all classes, read the entire chapters, pay attention to slides texts and your notes. Study and understand all figures/pictures in your text book.  Tests are difficult if you don't study. Don't just memorize definitions- understand them. Don't over analyze test questions."
2215,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL113,1.5,5.0,"He is a horrible professor. Highly knowledgeable, but doesn't know how to convey his knowledge. He reads slides and that's it. Also, he is a tough paper grader. The whole grade is based mostly on exams and a research paper.  I think he should read these comments and adjust his ego teaching style. He is unapproachable and not helpful when you do."
2216,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,2.0,5.0,"Gosh, is this guy hard or what?  If you are not the studying type, this is not the class for you!  He makes you ACTUALLY learn things.  He's very knowlegable about Biology, but is not very approachable.  Very stiff, stern, and a little intimidating.  Parker will definitely prepare you harder, more demanding courses."
2217,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,3.0,"If you are planning on a career in healthcare, then Parker will prepare you for the many harder classes to follow. This class was by no means easy, but if you do well in Parker's class you will survive A&amp;P too. I found him approachable, was quick to answer questions via email or in office. I can see why people dont like him but I thought he was ok."
2218,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,4.5,4.0,Dr.Parker is a great teacher. If you take the time to review your notes you will do fine. It is not a walk throught the park but if your looking for one go find another profession. Plus he isnt to bad to look at! Id almost be willing to take it again just to stare.
2219,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,3.5,5.0,"DON'T TAKE HIM!Dont understand why he makes Biol seem so hard. He starts off the first day saying that students fail his class because they don't ask for help. But how can you when he tells you more than half drop or fail.And if you ask him for help on something, instead of helping you he tells you to drop the course. Wish he didn't teach Biol 197."
2220,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,4.0,4.0,"I took him this spring and I must say he is very knowledgeable about his stuff. if you are prepared to study biology and not just breeze through the class you can take him. he would enhance your study skills cuz you will actually be studying biology if you are looking for an easy A, this is not the class for you. he is my favorite bio teacher, even"
2221,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,2.0,5.0,BEWARE!  His classes are very boring.  He uses the powerpoint every time and goes extremely fast.  Most people bring recorders.  He is unapproachable and likes to brag on the first day of class that 75% will fail.  I dropped his class and took it with another professor and I learned so much more.  He is one of the worst teachers. I've had.
2222,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Parker is one of the best teachers I ever had, if you want to go into the health profession, take his class.  He wants to make sure that you understand the integral elements of Biology.  Are you trying to pass College, or do you really want to learn?"
2223,452351,Joshua,Parker,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL841,1.5,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HIM! Seriously, he is one of my worst teacher ever. Being in education is not easy to talk negative about a teacher but he's just impossible to follow. We had a substitute when he was away and OMG what a difference! He should not teach but be in a lab or do researches...would do all students a favor!"
2225,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,3.0,3.0,"I had this professor in the Spring, and though he wasn't my favorite professor, I really don't think he's as bad as some of the reviews claim. I did not like his politics nor having to do papers, but he was at least accessible and his exams were pretty easy so long as you read the book. The class at least served its purpose."
2226,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,"I had this professor in the Spring. He was one of the few professors that prepared us for the shutdown. I was not happy it went online, but he started talking about what we would have to do if there was a shutdown. The transition was smooth in this class. Not in others."
2227,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PCS101,1.0,5.0,"Professor Monardis syllabus is intimidating, He states that is best to not work while taking his class. That is how demanding his class is, his online class has 5 timed quizzes and 4 timed exams. 5 papers and weekly discussions, his study guides are extremely long for each chapter and go by the book. Be prepared to read and search for the answers."
2228,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,1.0,4.0,I had a very hard time following along with this class. His lectures made no sense because he would go off topic often. Butt ton of readings and study guides to answer that do not help you whatsoever on the test. When asking him to clarify something he would say to just drop the class instead of helping. 100% would not recommend this professor.
2229,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,1.0,4.0,"Let me be as clear as possible hes not a bad tescher , but he definetly is a 0 in every other area. He goes off topic on lectures often making it difficult to single out whats important. He assigns a MOUNTAIN of reading. His study guides will help very little . Worse of all he is not the nicest guy socially (rude). However his papers areflexible"
2230,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,2.0,4.0,Monardis class was alright and made me wish I took someone else but it was the only class available. His class wasnt an easy one and will only pass if you take it seriously. So much required reading and much of the test questions didnt reflect on study guides or lectures. I would recommend taking a different professor if you can.
2231,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,1.0,5.0,"this professor is very disorganized, hes always off topic. and every powerpoint is completely different from the textbook. when quizzes come you have no idea what to be studying for! he messed up the grading scale. he makes you remember 12 vocab words and only puts two on the test. would not recommend taking this professor."
2232,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,1.0,4.0,"Goes off topic about politics so you dont know whats important. His study guides &amp; notes have a lot info thats not even on the test. A lot of reading. You have to memorize 12 words but there are only 2 on the test &amp; 3 essays but 1 is on the test. Grading system is so awful, many people were confused and upset. Pretty much busy work for no reason"
2233,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,I was not happy with this class at first. The first couple of quizzes or exams are hard. But he gave great suggestions to improve. Listen to that. I appreciate how much I am learning now.
2234,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,3.0,4.0,"So much reading! The information on the study guides he provides does not reflect the questions on the quizzes and exams. Incorrect page numbers were posted in the modules throughout the semester, so I was often reading the wrong information. I would not take this professor again; he's curt, disorganized, and his tests are really difficult."
2235,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,I really enjoyed this class. I did not expect that at first. The professor is enthusiastic and explains material clearly. The weekly study guides help.
2236,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,"8 Week summer course was fast. The assignments were interesting though, even though. Professor responds quickly to emails."
2237,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,"I had to study harder for this class than any other class except A &amp; P. But now that the semester is over, I realized that I learned more in this class than most others. The humor is very subtle."
2238,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher! He has 3 quizzes &amp; 3 Exams throughout the semester. The exams consist of questions from the quiz and we do weekly kahoots in class which really help! He does not try to trick you, he tells you exactly what is on the test. Some took advantage of his kindness. Show up, study, &amp; you'll exceed! Textbook is not really needed but helpful."
2239,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PCS101,1.0,5.0,"I do not recommend this teacher. He is disorganized and rude. He requires you to download a special program on your computer that can not be downloaded on to school computers, ipads or lap tops. so if you are a student who relies on school computers, this is NOT the class for you. I can not believe I paid for this class."
2240,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,3.0,This professor explains course material very well. Exam and quiz questions are from class and the readings. There were a few papers to write. He provides feedback to improve future papers
2241,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,"Clear, organized lectures with some discussions. Need to take notes. Need to read!"
2242,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,3.0,He really reads your papers and gives you good feedback. He likes to see examples in the papers.
2243,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,He has good energy!
2244,570268,Fred,Monardi,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,1.0,4.0,"He frequently argued with students in his class. The class is easy to get left behind in and is very unforgiving when it comes to missing lecture/work. Seems to have some anger problems. Would recommend trying to get into another class. If not, good luck."
2246,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189L,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Wainscott is one of the best professors I've ever had! I'm so glad I got to take Biol 189 with him I don't think I could have learned it better with anyone else! Study his powerpoints, show up to lecture (he's so funny you won't be bored), do his optional study guides and everything you need to learn will be there! If you study you will pass!"
2247,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,"The people who gives Wainscott negative comments and low numbers did not study. In order to pass you need to study, you cannot just go into class every week and think you will pass. But if you study he gives you every oppertunity to pass and get a high grade. If you fail in this class its on you not the professor. He does an amazing job!"
2248,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,"Wainscott is an amazing professor that really makes Biol 189 fun and easy. He is accesible outside of class. Never opened the book, all exam questions are from his slides. If you know the slides by heart and the examples you get an A on the exam. He is the most amazing professor you could ask for! 4 exams and a cumulative final. TAKE HIM."
2249,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Wainscott is amazing/funny! Class consists of 10 EASY online assessments, 4 Unit Exams, &amp; 1 Final Exam. PRINT OUT his powerpoints and write notes on them. Stay on top of every lesson and complete review questions for each one! He makes it easier for you to succeed if you put in work and try hard. The material is tough, but its biology! 10/10"
2250,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Professor Wainscott is an amazing professor! You have to earn your grade! Print out the powerpoints for each lesson, read them, and take lots of notes. The study guides are very helpful. Khan Academy and Amoeba Sisters help a bunch too! You have to study for HOURS in a week to earn a passing grade. Recording each lecture helps too! Good luck!!"
2251,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"He is an amazing professor, you have to earn your grade. Print the powerpoints for each lesson, read them and take lots of notes. The study guides provided by him are very helpful. You have to put the HOURS in all week to earn a passing grade. I wish he taught other classes I need. Do yourself a favor and take him as well as study."
2252,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,3.0,"At this point in your academic course, attendance shouldn't be an issue if you really cared about your education. Therefore, my review will be based on the fact that you're a student that does his/her part. Yes, this course is dense. However, he posts his powerpoints online and has lenient office hours. There's no reason why you should fail."
2253,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors Ive ever had! His lectures are actually interesting and he relates things to real life so you can remember them. He is super funny and helpful. The material is difficult but he gives you study guide questions, just pay attention to those and youll be fine!"
2254,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO197,5.0,3.0,"This professor was hands down my FAVORITE teacher of all time! I can not express how wonderful he is, he is available for professor hours, so if you are struggling there is no reason you can't get help. HIs love for the subject shows in his teaching and has inspired me to look more into biology as a career path, as I am currently Pre-Med student."
2255,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,difficult tests material in tests not found in book. very tough grader
2256,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,he's Terrible. I retook class with different professor and had a way easier time...
2257,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,Brian is funny and likes to use objects and students to get you to understand the lecture. You have to study the slides he has for you (they will be on the exams). I did not have to use the text book at all. You do have to study a lot. I wish he taught other Bio classes.
2258,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO197,5.0,3.0,Best Professor hands down!! Missed an exam (got dates mixed up) and he still let me take it!! He makes biology fun and is funny! He cares for each and every student and wants you to succeed. Textbook was not needed. Everything on the test comes from his lecture and p.p slides. Also provides study guides! STUDY at least 2hrs a day and YOU WILL PASS!
2259,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,Wasnt required to attend his lecture classes unless their was a test or quiz. I do think that I couldve done better if I did go to all of them. He does modules so no text book was required for lec. You do have to attend all the labs. Make sure you study the last lab for the following week for the quizzes he gives them to us beginning of class.
2260,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,4.0,4.0,"He's a good professor! This class is tough, but he teaches well. Everything on his powerpoint is on the exam. As long as you study the power points then you will do good! He does not go over the exam and his grades only consists of exams. He also drops the lowest exam grade so that's good!"
2261,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"This professor was the best! Bio 189 is a hard course overall, but he made it easy and fun as it can get! I took him for lab and lecture and I would def take him again. His tests are off his powerpoint and the book is not required but it was helpful to get more information to understand the material! He was awesome!"
2262,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,Hes not helpful at all. He gets offended really easily if you ask him a question. His study guides and tests are completely different. Doesnt go over exams. Doesn' give hints or tell you what to study for. He gives way to many exams and quizes and his questions are ridiculous. 10/10 dont do it.
2263,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,Professor Wainscott is the best professor I've ever had! His lectures are entertaining yet informative and he tries to keep everyone engaged. He creates power points for the lectures and posts them online. Print them off and use them to study! Your grade is based solely on exams. The exams aren't easy so study. Seriously take him!
2264,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,2.0,5.0,A tough grader and really difficult exams.
2265,673051,Brian,Wainscott,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,1.0,5.0,Hated this class. Find another professor
2267,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,3.0,4.0,If you're not a visual person don't take his class. His lectures are mainly on the white board and he likes to draw. Don't skip class because you'll be behind.
2268,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL101,1.0,5.0,"I am not sure how Mr. Jackson got good reviews. It seemed like he didn't care for the class, didn't bother to explain the assignments, just expected us to understand the material. Extreme lack of participation. This online course is very difficult. The readings, quizzes and tests are custom made by Professor Dawn Nelson at CSN. Not an easy class."
2269,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL224,2.0,5.0,"He is an amazing prof, but I am not good at notes &amp; studying so I did not do well on the tests. I stayed the whole semester to get the feel of 224 and labs, but I chose not to retake 224 with Dr. Fred because his teaching method and my learning method do not go well. His drawings are not clear! They require alot of looking through books - beware."
2270,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,5.0,3.0,"Everything he goes over in his lectures are on the exams! Id suggest having a laptop, he goes over on for rather quickly , so Id imagine you wouldnt be able to jot down information before hes finished. If you dont have a laptop record his lectures. Read the book, he follows it for the most part!"
2271,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL224,5.0,5.0,"Took him for 223 and 224. Hope he's well enough to return. Tough, tough test-writer but I made an A for 223, B for 224. Available during office hours for questions; even tutored one classmate for 2 hours twice a week. Record the lectures: I cannot stress this enough. Listen to them over and over. Make flashcards. It's a tough class. But I loved him"
2272,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,5.0,4.0,"If you feel you NEED PPTs and handouts to pass, he may not be your first pick. His teaching materials include markers, the whiteboard, and his brain. However, if you're willing to try something new, you may be pleasantly surprised. His tests are not as difficult as everyone makes them out to be. The ones leaving terrible reviews did not try."
2273,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL224,5.0,4.0,"Don't cheat yourself and take the ""easier"" teacher. Dr. Jackson will help you comprehend the human body and all it's complexities with more clarity than any teacher out there. You can tell he has a real passion for teaching. I took him for 223 and 224 and I can honestly say I'm going to miss him"
2274,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO225,5.0,3.0,"Ok I dont understand all the negative feedbacks, he is one of the BEST professors Ive taken at CSN, You cant expect BIO to be easy you have to work for it. I studied at least 40 hours a week maybe more plus lab. He writes everything down so be ready to keep up and record his lectures it helps! Only 5 tests plus a final , and he curves a lot !"
2275,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO223,5.0,3.0,"Ok so most people have him negative feed back but I can say I LOVE this professor ! Took him for 223 and 224 and passed! You need to actually try and study a lot, dont go into bio and think its a easy A with out trying . Everything he says is on the test so bring a recorder ! Good luck !"
2276,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,5.0,5.0,"Visit every lecture! I got A but it was very hard! My strategy: write down everything you can at the lectures. Read the book at home once, refresh 2-4 times the info from your notes before the exam. I did the voice recordings in the beginning but never used them"
2277,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL224,5.0,5.0,"To pass the class, have a recorder, colored pens, and a notebook. Although you can read the book, it has too much information and MOST of the questions in his exams are based on his Lectures (NO PPTs or handouts). I would probably get an A if I took the first exam more seriously, but once I got my recorder my grades shot up significantly."
2278,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,"I took priofessor Jackson fall 2018 evening class at the henderson location. I never knew how to study my whole life with schooling, but always end up passing. He gave me pointers to study differently, which helped me to understand biol better. When you need help, hes always available and always smiling. Just study!"
2279,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,5.0,4.0,"Straight old school, uses white board and lectures on everything he draws. Very clear with his explanations and always willing to answer questions. Tests are tough but come straight from his lectures. Recording is ok. He doesn't require textbooks but suggests them to help study. I strongly recommend if you can listen and note take at the same time"
2280,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,5.0,3.0,"Professor Jackson was the best teacher I have ever had at CSN/UNLV. His lectures are easy to follow. Best thing to do is record his lectures and then scribe them word for word, if you do this and study just your notes alone, you will get an A. His exams are straight from lecture. Don't buy the book. I took him for 223 &amp; 224 cause I love him so much"
2281,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,5.0,4.0,"Dr Jackson is seen as ""tough"" because he doesn't use powerpoints. If you put in the work, record/re-listen to the lectures, you'll be fine! Don't get scared away by his old school ways, you'll learn more than you ever thought you could. I took him for 223 and 224, would take him for other classes if I could. Master his tests and you'll be good!"
2282,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL224,5.0,3.0,"I loved him so much! His lectures are great and he's very knowledgeable, he does each lecture from memory! Biol 224 is a very hard class but he was able to explain things in ways we understood. Be prepared to study, I've never studied more for a class. I recorded his lectures and spent about 3 hours on each one."
2283,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL224,5.0,4.0,"I tediously worked hard for this class and the results showed. The professor is very knowledgeable with the material. He explains the lectures in a manner where one can really understand, even though the material is difficult to understand. These are one of the gems of CSN, Jackson exams are difficult but I would recommend just study the material!"
2284,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Jackson was my favorite professor. I had him for 223 and 224. He doesn't use powerpoint because he doesn't need to. He does his entire lecture by memory and by drawing detailed diagrams on the board. He highly recommends recording his lectures. When reviewing for exams, the recordings are very helpful to add text to your diagram drawings."
2285,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,5.0,4.0,"BIO 223 with Dr. Jackson in 1997. I learned a lot from that class and took those lessons on to medical school. Dr. Jackson's teaching made medical school anatomy relatively easy for me. Dr. Jackson was very inspirational in my journey towards medical school. His encouragement and belief in me, when I doubted myself will forever be appreciated."
2286,2009757,Fredrick,Jackson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL223,4.0,4.0,Biol 223 is tough no matter how you look at it. What great about Dr. Jackson is you must attend his class to get the materials. Recording his lectures is a must. He does not refer much to the textbook (only on the first 2 chapters). His teaching technique is old school. No powerpoints or pictures. Study from his lecture. Study hard and you'll pass.
2288,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,MHDD127,4.0,5.0,"Professor Moya is one of the hardest professor I had to go trough, she does not give second chances , very strict , few options of extra credit , and she is tough when grading !!! Heads up , I wouldnt take another one of her classes ever !"
2289,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY240,1.0,5.0,"Professor Moya is literally insane, Do not take a class from her. She will not help you with any question you ask, and she will not take any accountability. I contacted her about a grade I got on extra credit and that I had followed the instructions to a T and still got 4/15 she told me she wouldn't be manipulated! What? LOL! she wants you to fail!"
2290,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,1.0,5.0,"I learned a lot from the book, did well on the exams but her UPSURD formatting requirements with minimal instructions on how to actually meet them, and non-helpful remarks when reached out to, did not make for a good learning experience. Was also the only professor I had that did not release a Course and Instructor Evaluation, weird."

If you take her online your grade is only based on few things so DO THE EXTRA CREDIT. Like other people said her formatting is time consuming! Be ready to not get the grade you expect on your hard work!!!"
2292,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,3.0,3.0,"Prof. Moya has some great lectures, that may be because the subject is pretty fascinating. She is extremely intimidating, and not understanding to your situations. If you are a minute late you do not get the attendance points. I was in her class during Covid-19, so this may differ but her tests are relatively easy true or false right from the text"

2295,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,MHDD109,1.0,5.0,Dr. Moya DEMANDS a very specific format for all papers. If you do not format her way she will not grade. ALL papers had a minimum word count of 800 words. If you email her with a questions she will respond in a very blunt way; no real explanation. Be prepared to write A LOT and still not receive the grade you hoped for. TOUGH GRADER!!!!!!!
2296,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,1.0,5.0,"Professor Moya was the worst prof I have ever had. First off, the formatting is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS, she makes you bold, underline and color words but, doesn't tell you what words or give any examples Second, so extremely rude. Don't even think about asking a question because she pretty much answers with ""Are you stupid."" DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!!"

2299,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,MHDD127,5.0,3.0,Everything is clear and she gives tons of extra credit. You are just lazy if you do not pass her class.
2300,1094518,Maria,Moya,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY200,5.0,1.0,This class is based on two tests in the summer. Tests were straight forward and a lot of the info was found on quizlet. Take her for psy200 because you will get an A without studying

2313,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,If you want to take a professor who is great but also challenges you I definitely recommend her class! Hopefully in the future i'll have the pleasure of attending one of her classes again!
2314,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,This professor is a gift from the gods. She is amazing at teaching. If you have the opportunity to take her. DO IT. She makes everything so understandable. She definitely tough but as long as you put in the work she will make the class a breeze the way she teaches.
2315,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO122,3.0,4.0,"Lots of lectures. Make sure to allow time for studying and do the study guides. Also, don't miss a class because a lot of information is covered in each class period. She will mark you down for being 5 minutes late with an assignment regardless of the circumstance; a complete stickler for turning things in on time."
2316,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,"I highly recommend taking Dr. Preite! She is an amazing professor and wants you to succeed. Trust me, I am not great at science, but I worked hard. I studied at least 2 hours a day and it paid off. Her tests are hard, but you will pass as long as you read your materials. RECORD HER LECTURES! When she says study 2-3 hours a day, she means it."
2317,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Dr. P really makes things very understandable with her memorable examples. She's very available with office hours and even hosting exam reviews during her own free time. Like really, who would do that? She would. She cares a lot for her students and I'm so fortunate to have taken her for BIO189 LEC and LAB. Best professor ever. Thank you Dr. P!"
2318,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189LECTURE,2.0,5.0,If taking her class she's tough. Record her every lecture and take n ask as many question you have. Go to quiz review. Her test need to be to her liking her wording. If i was you take different teacher all together for lecture and lab. Unless you want a challenge n tons tons of homework n late nights.
2319,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"DR. P is the best! She really wants you to succeed. Tons of canvas material to supplement learning. Don't expect to not study and pass. 189 is HARD. No matter the professor. But it should be because most are going into health care. I wouldn't want a nurse who can't pass a basic biology class. She gives you all the tools, you need to do the work."
2320,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,3.0,4.0,"Exams are difficult, and has written portions on her exams that are no joke! Everything must be written and spelled correctly. Good professor over all, but definitely a very tough grader!!"
2321,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Preite's class is challenging: she requires you to learn the material and also know how to apply it. Dr. Preite cares about the subject and her students. Her lectures are interesting and entertaining, and she's incredibly available if you have questions. She's thorough and expects a lot, and I think I got more out of the class because of that."
2322,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"I love her! So much. 189 was the first class I took at CSN. I have a bachelors from another, much larger University, and honestly thought that going to a small college would be a cake-walk. Holy moly - nope. Not only are these classes challenging, but I have found professors like Preite to be some of the best teachers I've ever had! She's amazing!"
2323,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"I am currently finishing up my nursing prerequisite classes. I am in 224 and 251 this semester, earning As in both. I attribute my good grades to Dr. Preites 189 class. I remember everything! She was one of my favorite teachers. I studied HARD and earned an A in a summer term. Use her study guides! Theyre everything you need to know!"
2324,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,Dr Priete was an amazing professor. Biol189 is an extremely hard class and she made it easy to get help and understand. Her lectures are interesting and she breaks down everything so that you can understand. Definitely take her if you want to learn and get a good grade.
2325,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL196,5.0,4.0,"Dr P is EXCELLENT. If you are a biology major this is exactly who you want teaching you. She packs in so much information, and provides tons of resources in Canvas to help you understand the material from different angles (use them!). Highly recommend her for lab as well. Grading is slightly tough, but you will learn to really know your material."
2326,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL251,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Preite is amazing! Her lectures are not boring, she breaks everything down so you can understand it. Do not miss class!! She provides PowerPoint slides on Canvas, but theyre blank so you need to be in class to complete them. She also will not give you your homework or test grade if youre not in class."
2327,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,2.0,"You guys. Don't listen to anyone who say she is hard. They must have not tried. I came to class, listened, filed out the study guides, and passed the class with a 96% in the 8-week summer semester. I hardly studied outside of class except to fill out the study guide with what she said in class. Take notes. Listen. Do the study guide. You'll ace it."
2328,1644709,Carrie,Preite,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,3.0,"Dr. P is not an easy A, but she also is NOT hard. I got an A in the class over the summer, when it was shorter and much more intense. I read the book, but many people said they didn't need to. I thought her tests were fairly easy and never got below an 89% on them. Doing the study guides after class will save you and help you ace the tests."
2330,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,3.0,Great professor who does a great job of relating the class to the real world. Definitely worth the time. Take him for your BUS101 for sure. It's not tough but it's interesting at least.
2331,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,4.0,Prof. Robb Bay is great at his job. He does not micromanage you or overload you with unnecessary extra work. But he does give you work related to the course in interesting ways. I enjoyed the course overall and I feel i learned some great ways to stay focused on my goals and to define my goals for career and life.
2332,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,MGMT201,4.0,2.0,"If you show up to his class, you will get an A. I took his class in person, until we were forced to go online because of Covid. In class, he lectures for most of the time and you watch a video at the end. It is kind of boring sometimes, but I recommend it because its an easy grade with easy assignments. Also, all tests are open book!"
2333,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,2.0,"You'll need a textbook, though the access code that comes w/it also has the book digitally as well. The txtbook assignments are easy to do if you read the whole chapter. There's a project that consist of 4 parts: vocab, 2 essays (1 book needed) and making a poster due at the end. Recommend to do some chapters every week so you don't get behind."
2334,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,4.0,"20 Spring The first Professor that Ive studied under who utilizes all learning styles in his instruction (audio, visual, and kinesthetic). Lots of work, but its engaging. Theres a requirement to read another book and article in addition to the required text book reading. 4 projects replaced a final. If you enjoy reading, youll love this class!"
2335,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,2.0,"This professor is awesome! He has three major deadlines on an online program that you have to pay for. Program consist of video with questions which is super easy. Then you have the big final project consisting of vocab, a treasure map showing your goals, analysis of a business book, and a summary on a CNN saving money article. Seriously take him!"
2336,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUISNESS101,5.0,2.0,"His online course was cake. He gives THREE major deadlines in the semester and basically leaves you alone to meet the deadline yourself. The final project is a two page book report (double spaced) a ""treasure map"" and 150 vocabulary word assignment. Take the course, about as easy as it can be for CSN. Plus he has worked with managament Gurus"
2337,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUISNESS101,2.0,2.0,"Taking the class online. This guy doesnt respond to emails, like at all. Were in the middle of a pandemic what else do you have going on at home you cant reply? Theres a chapter I missed do I bother doing it if Im not sure if I get any credit?"
2338,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,MGT201,2.0,1.0,"Literally got an A's on both tests. Turned in my final said my work was ""poor"" and gave me a C. Showed up every day for class and participated daily. He literally talks about useless information the first half of the class. Then you watch a lame video sign the attendance sheet and that's it. ONLY FOCUS ON THE FINAL EVERYTHING ELSE DOESN'T MATTER!!"
2339,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,2.0,"I took the online class and it was easy yet I still learned a lot. You do need the textbook for the vocabulary words and also the book he assigns for the book report. Besides that, the online work consisted of powerpoint/video and quizzes. There are two extra credit assignments. You also get extra points for turning in all of your work."
2340,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,MGT201,5.0,1.0,"Videos and Exams, easy A"
2341,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,MGT201,5.0,3.0,Super easy professor! Barely any work and we had group test. All of our work is due at the end of the semester so just keep up. Easy A.
2342,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,2.0,"This class was awesome!!! Easy assignments. They kind of take a while, but they are actually educational and helpful to everyday life. The projects in this class are the absolute best. We have to create a vision board &amp; it meant so much to me. The book assignment is amazing. All around awesome guy who wants success for his students!"
2343,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,1.0,Super awesome professor and really easy class in general as long as you keep up with the assignments. I would definitely take this class again. Also a fun project at the end.
2344,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Bay is very helpful and available. Make sure to start working on the final projects early, and you'll have no problems. Syllabus is a bit old school in that it could be updated a bit but it's fine, but all the course materials are up to date. I would definitely take from him again!"
2345,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,2.0,"I took Business 101 over the summer. Honestly easy A, simply read the chapter and/or lecture, do all the online homework and youll pass. You have 2 papers, vocab, and a vision board type of projects at the end for the class for a final grade. Definitely recommend!"
2346,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,5.0,3.0,"Took the class on-line over the summer (8 weeks) got a B, clear directions not a super heavy workload. Super fun project at the end :)"
2347,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,BUS101,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bay is a realistic teacher. His course is not test heavy as he understands business isn't always black and white. The textbook he assigned was easy to understand. His case studies are a good glimpse into the real world of business. This course is an easy A. He leaves most of the work for you to do at home, so you must be motivated."
2348,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,MGT201,5.0,1.0,Book is online in a PDF form. Buy/rent second book. Tests are easy as are the assignments. I will agree to try to finish all the assignments ASAP so that you are not rushing last minute. Everything is turned in at the end via e-format so I would recommend an app to make everything easier. Would def. take again if he taught other classes.
2349,403844,Robb,Bay,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Management,MGT101,5.0,5.0,Professor Robb Bay is a great professor and excellent professional. I have taken BUS 101 and MGT 201 and in both my score A+. Thank you professor It was a pleasure to meet you. God Bless you.

2352,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,2.0,I took this class online. You don't need a book. He gives you all the info needed in the modules. Gives lost of extra credit opportunities.
2353,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,2.0,"This is, by far, the EASIEST class I have ever taken! There are 9 quizzes, 1 midterm, and 1 final during his 6 week summer course, along with lots of extra credit opportunities. There's no book because he provides all the lectures for you, and they are all interesting! If you need to take PHIL 102, take Professor Howe!"
2354,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,2.0,"He is an amazing and easy professor. I took his 6 week summer session and finished the entire course within the first week. There were 9 quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam. They were all super easy. He also give a lot of extra credit."
2355,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,There is no textbook and all of the reading is broken up into separate modules. The quizzes follow the modules. Great Class with an easy to digest format. I would take him again if I needed any other philosophy classes.
2356,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,4.0,"This class is not easy because you have to think outside the box, but you can pass if you really try your best and put in the work. The reason I would definitely take professor howe again because how caring &amp; humble he is. He takes the time to explain everything to you. Unlike other professors that say ""Did you read the book?"" when you ask for help"
2357,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,3.0,"Dr. H was beyond amazing, he has a deadline for all quizzes due at once so you are able to work ahead if need be and manage your own workload. He also requires no textbook and has all the info you need in the modules. I found his class super inspirational - I really took his words in! Extra credit is available as well. Thank you Dr. H!"
2358,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"I honestly recommend this course to anyone who needs to balance their schedule. Half of the assignments are due at midterm and the other at the end so you have the freedom to complete them when you can. There's no papers, or discussions, just module quizzes that can be completed by reading the modules. He also offers extra credit periodically."
2359,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"No Book needed. All his lectures are written out &amp; includes practice questions for the tests &amp; exams. If you read the assignments &amp; do the practice quizzes, you will pass. He lets you work at your own pace, all assignments are open, first half due by midterm, second half due by the final exam. He answers questions quickly and allows phone calls."
2360,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"Take this class if your degree needs it!! Easy A. You can work ahead on all your assignments. You dont need a textbook, he will have all his readings on the modules."
2361,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL101,4.0,2.0,"Grades based on only quizzes and test. PHIL 101 you can take the quizzes twice, which sometimes he shows the answers after and sometimes he doesn't. PHIL 102, you can only take the quizzes once. Pointless to do extra credit, I never got credit for them. Fairly easy classes if you do the readings."
2362,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,4.0,1.0,"Professor Howe is a solid choice for PHIL 102. There is no required textbook; instead he uploads his own written material for students to read and test on. There are no papers or writing assignments, only the occasional exam, a midterm, final, and extra cred. If you have the chance to take him, jump on it! He's a great professor with a great class."
2363,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL101,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Howe is the bomb dot com. He gives great notes, so use them because the information he gives will be on the mid-term and/or final. He's more than fair and doesn't try to trick you with useless information. AWESOME Instructor. I want to take him for Phil 102 online also!"
2364,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL205,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! Before you turn in your midterm/final, he lets you email him a draft and gives immediate feedback. DO THIS! A few books to read but they are fairly easy to understand. Only four quizzes of 10 questions so be careful. Everything is available at the beginning of sem, but don't wait until the last second! Don't stress unnecessarily."
2365,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,3.0,This class was beyond easy! His lectures are in the modules. There are many quizzes but the deadlines are manageable! He answers you right away and his extra credit is very easy! Fantastic Class for online!!
2366,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"EASIEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. Seriously, his material is so straight forward with tons of extra credit opportunities. I passed with more than 100%. Also, the answers to all of his quizzes (midterm &amp; final also) are online."
2367,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,2.0,Great professor who always responded quickly when I needed help and is very understanding.
2368,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"I just completed a 4 week session with Professor Howe and I was impressed. Exceptional professor with a clear syllabus and course work outline. There is no homework. 9 Quizzes, Midterm, Final, and you are done! He also unlocks almost all of the course material allowing you to work ahead. Read the modules, take good notes, and you will get an A!"
2369,864728,Richard,Howe,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"Great Prof. Accessible anytime, provides good feedback. No textbook needed. Do the work and you will pass. 5 Opportunities for extra credit. Must take, you will not regret!"

2372,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,2.0,4.0,Since the COVID 19 pandemic started we switched to remote distance. It was very difficult and lots of homework to instill the concepts have been understood. His study guides were useless and same with the practice test. I did heavy reading and practice test on the My Lab and Mastering but his test were extremely difficult. He needs a SI tutor.
2373,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,2.0,4.0,He's okay but his wording makes everything harder. The practice tests don't help with the actual tests. His wording of the questions makes it difficult to get them right. He makes you work really hard for the grade that you want. Don't recommend
2374,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,The way he teaches is confusing only because what he says isnt on the test . He is very tricky with his test questions and into detail about the subject. He doesnt like when you ask a question from previous chapters. He talks at you like a Biology scholar &amp; not a student that doesnt know the stuff . Most of my class got Fs on the test .
2375,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,"By far the worst professor I have ever taken. I'm not one to blame a professor, but he is the reason I withdrew from the class. His lectures are so confusing and he goes on these long tangents about something and then says ""you don't need to know that though."" The majority the class failed his test and he stated that ""it was normal."" TERRIBLE PROF"
2376,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189L,2.0,4.0,"If you absolutely have to take him for lab like I did because he was the only option, here's what you do: READ THE LAB MANUAL (it is your friend), WRITE DOWN HIS NOTES HE PUTS ON THE BOARD, ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE THE QUIZZES, AND GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS FOR HELP! DON'T BE AFRAID NOR ASHAMED. IT REALLY HELPS!! GOOD LUCK YOU BRAVE SOUL!"
2377,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,2.0,5.0,"If you absolutely have to take him like I did because he was the only option, here's what you do: RECORD HIS LECTURES, TAKE ALL NOTES HE WRITES ON THE BOARD, UTILIZE HIS POWERPOINTS (even though he doesn't use them), &amp; MAKE FLASHCARDS. Beware of him tricking you on ALL exams and REALLY STUDY. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS! DON'T BE AFRAID NOR ASHAMED."
2378,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,"Avoid this instructor at all costs. I think he thinks we are scientists sitting in these seats. The language he uses in his lectures and tests are very confusing he might as well be speaking in pig latin. More than half of my class failed his class. Doesn't really teach, just lectures, expects you to comprehend by yourself and just read the book"
2379,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189L,3.0,4.0,"Professor Vogel is a tough teacher. He is a great person and means well. Heavy reading, must learn the materials provided &amp; attend his lectures. You will NEED to understand the topics/content from many different angles (using examples, definition, function, structure) that's the only way you will pass his class. Which has only helped me!"
2380,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,Lee Vogel is a professor I would suggest not taking. I ended up enrolling for his class because it was the last option but please take this as your warning. I've retaken Biology 189 and it does not come close to his way of teaching. Most of the material he goes over isn't close to what's on the test. And his homework assignments are not helpful.
2381,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,1.0,5.0,"He's the worst professor I have had. His lectures and tests don't always align. He adds material from the weeks lab to his lecture tests; I didn't get the lab studies until later in the week. He has a very low pass rate, more students fail than pass. Is also condescending. I love biology and was extremely disappointed in this professor."
2382,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,4.0,"Professor Vogel, I felt, was too harsh on his students. First day of class he stated that half the class would either drop out by midterm or average at a C grade or below. He sounded almost prideful when he mentioned that more than half the class was failing during midterm. Wasn't a good learning environment for me, so unfortunately I dropped out."
2383,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,"Not as bad as the comments say. The tests are lecture based. As long as you make sure you understand the concept and are able to apply it to different situations, you'll do just fine. Memorization will not get you anywhere in this class. He may sound a little harsh when explaining something but I'm pretty sure he doesn't do it on purpose."
2384,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,2.0,5.0,a type of professor that thinks he has the same level as his students knowledge and lecture his students as they know everything.
2385,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOLEC189,4.0,5.0,"A pure challenge. I found myself reinventing the way I study b/c the specifics of what is important to this Professor is in the details of BIO189. First I want to say.. find yourself a back up book that is very detailed, it'll help. The powerpoints will show you what is important. Dates get cancelled/change, so it is best that you are in attendance"
2386,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189LAB,3.0,4.0,Prof Vogel wasn't my favorite but he's not too bad. He tends to talk down to his students and makes you feel stupid if you answer a question wrong during lecture. I still got an A+ because he goes over the WHOLE quiz right before you begin so it's kinda hard to really fail his class. He was nice and helpful if you ask questions after class.
2387,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,4.0,4.0,"NOT AN EASY A. Honestly a great into to Biology classes, you have to study. He doesn't take attendance but if you don't go to class the tests will be very hard for you. I hated him at first but he became one of my most liked teachers. Stick it out and put in the effort and you will come out with the knowledge you need! No busy work doesn't hurt!"
2388,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,3.0,5.0,"He is not hard but I think students got used to get an easy A. I see that some high GPA. If you get this GPA without studying, this is just nothing. English is my second language I got a B this class. If I did it, every person can do it. Just study and you will say 'thank you Mr. Vogel' when you take Micro and Chem."
2389,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,4.0,He doesn't explain things very well. He lectures like he expects you to know things and when you ask a question he'll look at you subtly like you're stupid for asking it. He doesn't like repeating himself and he's terrible at explaining things clearly. I had to repeat that because its true. Many people drop out of his class after a month.
2390,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,1.0,5.0,"If he is your only option for a bio teacher, DO NOT take him!! he makes the material so hard, the tests impossible and goes on rants about topics that are not relevant to the class at all. He claims bio is so easy but can't explain it to students!! had to retake the class and I am a 3.7 GPA student!!"
2391,897353,Lee,Vogel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,4.0,4.0,"Focus on content from lecture, the text is good for review of that content. Don't spend a lot of time on everything in the chapter that you are on. Test are based on Lecture info"
2392,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,3.0,"By far the worst professor I've ever had. The entire semester was a huge pain. The class is hard not to pass because of the extra credit but he does not answer questions clearly and often makes you feel dumb. Get ready to STUDY A LOT. He also doesn't ""allow"" students to use the restroom! very frustrating semester. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2393,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,5.0,"I took this dude my first semester at csn, let me assure you he is by far the worst teacher at the school. He gives you maybe ten minutes to take a 30 question test. Doesnt explain anything, and when you ask him questions he just rewords your question and goes but if you can find the question you will be rewarded handsomely."
2394,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,2.5,4.0,"While I escaped with a passing grade, Roby's class can be hard to handle. You have to read the book on you off time. Each week he gives out tests on the chapters. There is also several projects to do, and plenty of extra credit. He does not utilize Canvas, you have to visit his office to keep up to date on your grade."
2395,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,3.0,"Horrible professor.  I had him in my first semester of the high school program as a junior.  He never posted his grade progress on canvas and whenever I would try to question him about my grades, about a quarter of the lecture hall would be around his desk and I'd already be late for my high school class.  Had a B for the mid and a D at the end."
2396,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,2.0,1.0,"This was one of the easiest classes I've taken, but it was also the most annoying. It's hard not to fail because he gives A LOT of extra credit, and the midterm and final are both open notes and textbook.  Be warned that majority of the work is done in groups, so choose VERY carefully. Mr. Roby can be rude. He isn't that helpful and is very sassy."
2397,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,2.0,4.0,It is important to note the following: -All tests will be taken within your group -you will read every page of the book and be quizzed on all of it -participation is his motto -his mannerisms and the way he chooses to speak make him very pretentious that being said do not take this class if your vocabulary is limited. 2 difficult 4 a 101 class
2398,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,4.0,"Reading textbook is IMPERATIVE, but I didnt mind because it was interesting information. Tests are open note, which is nice, but the other assignments are unclear and he actually tries to trick you sometimes. He is very close minded and the style of his lectures is awful. Would not take him again."
2399,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,2.0,3.0,"Roby's lectures are rough. He does not use technology, nor does he relate topics well. He lets you use the book on the tests, as well as work in groups. It's a very easy class to pass, but hard to actually take any knowledge away. "
2400,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,4.0,"What a professor! If you want an easy A, steer away. However, if you truly want to learn the subject, Dr. Roby will guide you to a vast world of knowledge. Very passionate, enjoyable, and inspirational. He wants to see students succeed and if you do your part, he does more than his fair share. You work for an A, but he ensures it's all worth it!!"
2401,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.0,5.0,"He will ruin psychology for you. He tries to analyze his students and if you refuse he he marks off participation. He constantly allows his own psychological issues to interfere with any objective standpoint on whatever topic he's teaching. He won't put ANY grades in until a week after class so if you have questions on anything, forget it. "
2402,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Roby's class was very straight-forward. I suggest taking notes and reading the chapter before you come to class because both can help a lot. A big fraction of the work assigned is extra credit. DO THE INTANGIBLES. As long as you do the work and do the extra credit, you will get a good grade, most likely an A."
2403,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY233,4.5,4.0,"Outstanding professor- not an easy class though. Very intense (once a week). Chapter tests are open book note. Midterm final are take- home. Research paper presentation, video project, and chapter review of your choice are MAJOR. Participation is imperative to your grade. DO THE READING AND YOU WILL DO WELL. Weekly intangibles for extra credit."
2404,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.5,2.0,Roby was a great professor. If you are there to learn he is the professor that can teach you. If I needed another psychology class I would take him for sure.
2405,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH101,2.5,4.0,"Dr. Roby is a great guy but his class is confusing. I'm having an awful time trying to pass a weekly open book test. working in groups is great for some things but not weekly tests where your dependent on others to get through. Study, read notes, kick butt on research paper and do the intangibles. Also, do any and all extra credit."
2406,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.5,3.0,"You'll definitely have to read your book to keep on the weekly tests, but those tests are done in groups, and really only count for extra credit at the end of the semester. He doesn't only teach from the book however - the books introduce you to topics he'll cover in-depth in his lectures, which are fantastic if you're interesting in psychology."
2407,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.5,3.0,He is an extremely confusing professor. You will be telling yourself what ?????? but there is a lot of chances for extra credit all the quizzes are extra credit and the homework assignments given once a week are extra credit. we had one research paper and you have the whole semester to work on it. and you work in groups of three for all testswork
2408,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,2.0,3.0,"Interesting guy, but you pretty much have to self-educate yourself. A chapter every week of 40 pages and quizzes on second day of class. Lectures and notes are impossible to take and follow. DO INTANGIBLES. READ. If you can take another teacher, try too. Oh, and every test and midtermfinal are in a group. CHOSE WISELY. You pick first day. "
2409,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,3008,3.0,3.0,Makes you grow up and step up to the plate or he leaves you behind. Great class to get accustomed to college-level maturity.
2410,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,3.5,1.0,DO THE INTANGIBLES! The answers are in the book or google it. Open book tests w group and chapter. Glancing over the ch before the test will help. Keep all the tests and stress response because you will turn them ALL in at the end. Individual research paper due at the end of the semester.
2411,574700,William,Roby,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,1.5,3.0,"Lessons only useful at final exam, never useful in quizzes. Ridiculous planning, you will not know what you are doing EVER. Mandatory speeches and group projects. Open book tests, but that does not help. Expects you to read 100's of pages by the end of the year out of a boring textbook. Horrible teacher, beats around the bush, does not help. Bad."
2413,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH124,3.0,3.0,I took her fall'20 and she didn't really teach/interact; everything was done on pearson including learning which sucked. I learned the bare minimum and self-taught really. I wish real lectures were provided bc the way pearson taught was so slow. Lots of homework but the class isn't hard I just wished I actually was taught material by the professor.
2414,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,1.0,4.0,The professor did not seem to understand mathematical science. If you know the math take this professor if you need to learn the subject I would strongly suggest a different instructor.
2415,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH096,4.0,3.0,"Took Math 96 online. Class was through my math lab where you watch videos and do the homework. Even though youre basically teaching yourself, Professor Frieda was communicative via email. I passed with a C+, probably couldve passed with a A if I studied for the first test. 2 tests and 1 final but the practice guides are basically the tests."
2416,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH124,5.0,3.0,Many homework assignments. The only deadline is at the end of the class. You need to learn to work on your own pace in a timely manner to stay on track.
2417,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH096,5.0,3.0,"I took her online Math 95 last semester. I took Math 96 this semester. Having taken both versions of her class, I'd say she's better in person. She is effective in her lectures and gives you short cut methods and formulas to use. Sometimes doing the homework her way was much easier. I'd like to take her class again if she teaches Math 128"
2418,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH095,3.0,3.0,"If you are a person who needs someone to explain a problem, then don't take this class. Yes, she replies to emails within 24 hours. She uses math lab, if you hit help, it will explain the problem and the solution. Homework is 10% of your grade, tests 50%, final is 40%. She does give a practice test and you can use that to study. They rlly helped me"
2419,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH095,3.0,3.0,"Online class, A few problems with certain tests/reviews not being released. Not sure if it was MyMathLab. She usually responds to emails with in 24 hours; I only emailed her twice. Self paced, easy, I put 20 hrs/wk. which could've allowed mean to finish early. However The final is locked until the end of the semester. Grading is clear!"
2420,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH116,5.0,3.0,"Took a online class over the summer. Get ready to turn down any family time in the course of 4 weeks because lots of stuff to study. I found it easy to print everything and take a lot of notes. on mid-term and exam, your allowed to use a calculator and one front and back paper of formulas, which was very helpful."
2421,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH095,5.0,2.0,Great online class. I've taken this class with multiple instructors and she is by far the best. Even though most of it you are on your own. Just follow they syllabus and you will do fine. She was quick to respond when I had a test issue.
2422,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH95,5.0,3.0,This was a great online class if you are a busy person She gives all the homework and quarterly tests at once with quarterly deadlines so it is very easy to manage your schedule according to what works for you You get two attempts for the online tests taken from home The final is taken in person The practice final she gives is just like the Final
2423,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,1.0,4.0,"I took her online course and let me tell you, her grading criteria makes no sense. 10% homework, 48% tests 1&amp;2, and your final is worth 42%? I worked so hard all semester to get an 89 in the class only to take the final and end with a 66 despite spending many hours studying trying to understand the material. This class is a waste of money and time"
2424,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT96,1.0,4.0,"This teacher was absolutely horrendous, I could not understand her and she graded to the toughest extents. Would not recommend anyone to take this class ever."
2425,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH96,4.0,3.0,"Prof N has clear class etiquette, don't be disrespectful. Random pop 2 question quizzes to make sure you are learning and doing homework. Worth alot of grade so show up for class! Slow class in beginning to really understand basics. Homework and test online, one test at end of session. Always available outside of class and accommodating as well."
2426,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,5.0,2.0,"Wow, this professor can make math easy to understand. It was a fun class. She really cares about your learning. She spends as much time as you need in the Math Resource Center to help you with your questions. I never thought I could get a good grade in this course. But, I did!!"
2427,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,5.0,2.0,"Excellent course &amp; excellent professor. It was a stress free course for me. With the professor's guidelines and all the features of my math lab, I learned a great deal and passed the course with an ""A"". I love to take another course with her."
2428,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor! I took this course in  class with Frieda. Here lectures were beautiful. She makes sure you understand the concepts. The course was well organize. She was very helpful . And cares about yr success. I wish I could take all my math courses with her.  I definitely recommend her.
2429,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT95,1.0,3.0,"The majority of your grade is determined by only 2 tests, so if you don't do well on both your grade can drop significantly. As if that wasn't enough pressure, this makes the pressure to do well on the final exam even greater. She is not very involved with online students, and when you ask questions she's quick to catch an attitude!"
2430,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,5.0,3.0,"She is awesome. She is very good at explaining math concepts. There are weekly quizzes, 2 tests and a final exam. She gives a good review for the final exam. If you dont miss class and do your daily work you will get a very good grade."
2431,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,5.0,2.0,"Frieda is the best math professor I have ever had. She makes math so simple and easy to understand, I will take her again. And I recommend her to every one. :-)"
2432,610749,Frieda,Nilforoushan,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT096,4.5,2.0,Math has always been an easy subject for me. Her class is awesome because you can work ahead if you need to so that you are always on track as well as that she gives you 2 tries on the 2 tests. As well as the final is easy as long as you study the study guide. It is easy to pass the class if you do the work. Would recommend and would take again.
2434,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,1.0,5.0,Most of the answers were not found in the text book and the exams should be up to two hours at least to look at notes and answers online including the quizzes for 30 mins (at least). Reading a bunch of chapters for back to back exams should limited to a midterm and a final exam during the summer semester. Not everyone can catch on quickly.
2435,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,4.0,2.0,"If you dont get an A its probably because you didnt try. He makes it easy for students to pass. Quizzes, exams, and assignments are all online (online class). Simple class, easy A"
2436,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,EVN101,4.0,3.0,"I didn't find this course interesting by any means but the professor was professional and even though, there was a lot of reading I found it to be an intellectual course."
2437,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,3.0,3.0,Took his 8 week summer class. His syllabus is all over the place and is not consistent. All of the exams and quizzes were at the end of the semester. Heavy grader. Got A on every assignment and B on every test and got 91% overall. 50 question exams with only 50 minutes to finish. Take his summer class if you want to be constantly stressed out.
2438,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,GEOG117,5.0,4.0,"Best professor hands down. He is very clear about his expectations and requirements. He is the most punctual and accurate professor I've had. Attendance was not mandatory, but he would have surprise quizzes so it's all on you. There was weekly homework, the book definitely helps!"
2439,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,NRES210,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sims doesnt like complaining. Deadlines are listed, follow them. Read the chapters, do online research to compliment your answers. His syllabus is crystal clear and very easy to navigate as they should be. Do the work, dont complain and youll do fine. Hes been one of those teachers who changed my life."
2440,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,4.0,3.0,"Show up and take notes at least most days (I also found Powerpoints online) &amp; skim the chapter as per syllabus and you should have no problem passing. Lots of lecturing (reading straight off the slide, which can get a little annoying). Sometimes tries to engage class by asking questions we wouldn't typically know the answer to beforehand"
2441,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,NRES210,5.0,2.0,Great teacher and class. Mr. Sims was awesome and I will take a class from him again if I can.
2442,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,5.0,1.0,"This was my first online class and it was great. Dr. Sims has clear requirements and a schedule that I was able to follow. If you miss an assignment however, you do not get to make it up so, do not miss any items you are required to do."
2443,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, CSN needs more like Mr. Sims"
2444,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,GEOG103,5.0,3.0,Professor Sims was an amazing professor who truly makes his lectures interesting and allows us to learn in such an interactive way! Definitely need to read each chapter in order to be successful in the class also take great notes or your grade will reflect it. He gives packets and extra credit towards the end to help his students!
2445,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,GEOG103,5.0,3.0,Professor Sims is a great professor. Challenging but gives you plenty of opportunities to succeed and honestly just trying will get you a passing grade. He is very understanding of all parents and caregivers. Most of the grades come from in-class assignments that are packets from the lecture. Do the Essay! He literally hands everything you need!
2446,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,5.0,3.0,Professor Sims is a great professor. Challenging but gives you plenty of opportunities to succeed and honestly just trying will get you a passing grade. He is very understanding of all parents and caregivers. Most of the grades come from online assignments that are one paragraph responses and in-class exams. One extra assignment a 3-page essay
2447,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,4.0,3.0,"This class is easy enough. There is one assignment due per week and it is only a couple of sentences, so those are easy points. There are 5 modules and each module has a quiz(10 questions) and test(50 questions) that are timed for online. He gives an extra credit paper opportunity. It was interesting and he gets back to you fairly quickly."
2448,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,5.0,3.0,The class was very simple in terms of class time. You just sit and take notes but he is very helpful with insight regarding the material. Great Professor!
2449,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,EVN101,4.0,3.0,Great lectures and a very welcoming environment.
2450,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,GEOG117,5.0,3.0,"He does expect you to do your part, so do it. Show up as much as possible, as he does give you all the information you need and keep up with your work. He is flexible, he wants you to pass. He offers a makeup exam/quiz and makeup assignment at the end of the semester, which is more opportunity than I have from other professors. He is great."
2451,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,EVN101,5.0,4.0,"An excellent professor in his field. A good sense of humor and shows true heart for our planet. Someone who loves his job and knows exactly what he wants to pass on to his students. Only wants his students to pass but you have to put in effort for your own sake, youre the one paying for this class. Make the best of it because Dr. Sims is worth it!"
2452,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,ENV101,5.0,4.0,"One of the most knowledgeable guys out there, period point blank."
2453,1661748,Douglas,Sims,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Physical Sciences,GEOG103,5.0,2.0,"Took the 16 week course, easygoing experience. 4 quizzes &amp; exams are easy. Grading is a little harsh on the 3 page paper, know how to write in APA. About 10 worksheets that can be turned in late and some are extra credit. Says he doesnt post his powerpoints but ends up posting them for exams. Very easy to reach outside of class. Easy class."
2455,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,3.0,Troy has not graded anything since the first day of the semester. He's very lecture heavy but is impossible to reach outside of class.
2456,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,5.0,"This teacher needs to get his act together. You would think during a pandemic he would try to make things easier for his students. Nope. He has not graded ANYTHING, he doesnt respond to emails, and his lectures make no sense. No syllabus available and most assignments still have no instructions or due date. I do not recommend!"
2457,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,4.0,"Always late or noshow. Very difficult to understand, he mumbles quietly and quickly. I felt like the class was only being taught to the front row. His lectures were NON EXISTENT. Just him talking up front writing sloppily on the whiteboard a word or name. No homework or assignments made sense. All students in my class agreed - most of us withdrew."
2458,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,3.0,"My fiance and I took this class about 2 years ago and we still talk about what we learned there today. Troy might be the most philosophical professor I've met. As someone who's intellectual, he appeals to my nature. If you're not a thinker, this class may not be for you. Troy is the House M.D of CSN and excellent if you'd actually like to learn."
2459,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,4.0,He never graded anything on time. I didn't get my first grade in the class until the last week of the semester. He also never answered calls or texts leaving students to figure it out themselves. I only passed because of prior knowledge of writing in a news format because he doesn't like academic papers. Go to a different teacher.
2460,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,1.0,3.0,"Avoid this class at all costs. He vanished once classes went online. Students called, texted, and emailed but he didn't say anything until the day the project was due, then disappeared again. 12 long assignments with no lecture, no feedback, no nothing. No grades posted until the semester is over. I have never been so frustrated about a class."
2461,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,1.0,3.0,I literally did not know what had been going on the whole semester. He neither posted a syllabus nor graded assignments. His lectures and the assignments had no specific direction and Id been lost what exactly to do all the time. He posted total 12 new stories to write and each has like 25 pages article to read.
2462,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,1.0,2.0,"Gave 12 assignments where we had to write a news story on a sociological document. Each of these news stories were optional but are necessary to have written for the final. Lectures were confusing and had no direction. He barely showed up to class. Didn't learn a thing about sociology, but it was an easy A."
2463,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,1.0,1.0,"He does not care. He's been very, a no-show and since quarantine he has not communicated with the class. Students have been very lost on what is going on. As for textbooks, unless you plan on enriching yourself with it, don't buy it cause it wasn't used. 2-days till the semester is over and not a SINGLE grade has been inputted."
2464,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,1.0,3.0,I hated taking this class. He is a nice person but not a very good teacher. Not clear about what is required. Talks about his own life mainly. The only two grades are the midterm and final. These were extremely difficult because there was not a rubric or criteria or clear directions. I worked on my final for almost 6 hours and it was never graded .
2465,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,2.0,"He's honest when he critiques your work, but it was an easy class. His lectures helped more than the textbook, and the final, midterm, and project were easy. You just have to follow his simple, up front rules and you will be set! I would suggest showing up as often as possible, but you can surely get a good grade as long as you keep up at home."
2466,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,1.0,"Lectures felt more like confusing conversations than lectures. But this class was probably the easiest one I've ever taken. Troy really loves sociology and he cares for his students, he even hosts workshops for the one assignment he gives and tells you about it at the start so you have the whole semester to work on it."
2467,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,Troy is a great professor because he genuinely cares about what hes teaching and the well being of his students.
2468,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,3.0,4.0,"Sociology with McGinnis: I think the topic itself as a class would be almost life changing because its so interesting and rarely taught, but its only effective if it was taught correctly, appropriately, and in an organized manner. This is not a class if you are fresh from high school because you won't get the point."
2469,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,3.0,"Passionate Professor. His class is very unconventional, but you have to be open minded and patient with his teaching style. His lectures are student driven, so you have to actually participate in order to gain the knowledge that you want to gain. There is only one assignment due at the end of the semester, and all assignments are weighed as EC."
2470,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,5.0,"Great prof and person. Not too great on the assignments- midterm was easy, the manifesto you have to do is hard. Pretty much only gives you newsletters to write. ""Do it as creatively as you want but do it wrong and you fail"" sort of guy. But his lectures are great, very kind, super f'n smart."
2471,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC102,4.0,4.0,"Troy could easily surpass any other sociology when concerning means of sociology. He has literally flipped sociology inside and out, learning from all angles of it. He is a really smart guy. However, he could work on his teaching a little bit, and getting on students level to help them understand. I think that is his main struggle."
2472,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,PSY101,3.0,4.0,"Professor McGinnis is interesting. He is extremely smart and I think this is why his instructions aren't very clear. He thinks that you understand, when you don't. The lessons are good if you can keep up, however doesn't involve the book and you're only graded on 2 assignment, the midterm and final."
2473,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,2.0,"He is a cool teacher and he is funny but he rambles on throughout the class and he's all over the place. The only 2 things he grades are the midterm and final. The midterm and final have little to do with sociology so if you want to actually learn about sociology this isn't the prof for you. I like him as a person, not as a prof."
2474,160926,Troy,McGinnis,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,An Amazing Professor. Makes you think. Easy A if you pay attention. Goes out of his way to make sure you understand what he's lecturing about. He absolutely appreciates people when they participate. Always available when you need help. Incredibly intelligent. We need more professors like him! Will definitely recommend taking his class....
2476,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM242,5.0,4.0,"Listen, OChem isn't easy. Hammond is a tough as nails teacher, but he's good. Once you understand his style of teaching, and work your butt off for this course, you'll have a new respect for him and Chemistry. He is intentionally difficult because if you can get through his class then you truly understand Chemistry. Tough but totally worth it."
2477,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM241,5.0,5.0,"You will most likely hear ""Hammond"" and ""difficult"" in the same sentence and you would be correct. But I will say, if you take this class and are genuinely ready to study and reread lecture notes, you will leave this class absolutely understanding organic chemistry. I'd recommend this professor for those that are serious about learning chemistry."
2478,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM242,3.0,5.0,Hammond has a very distinct teaching style and is very old school with his teaching ways. I do appreciate that even though he is not a fan of technology he attempted to still help students online. O chem is just a very hard topic overall regardless of the professor. But Hammond will ensure you know your material being his student.
2479,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM110110L,1.0,5.0,Professor Hammond was the worse prof I ever had. He will expect you to be genius like him. His so fast in doing lecture and his exam is super long no multiple choice and there are a lot of topics included in 1 exam. Quiz is hard as well. He is a genius so if you are just average student it will be hard for you to take his class.
2480,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121,3.0,5.0,"very old school, no way to contact him outside of school. lectures are all over and doesnt do any examples unless asked. even then hell rush it. teaches and then expects you to know it same day for a quiz or next lecture. rushes through lectures because he gets side tracked"
2481,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM110,1.0,4.0,"The worst professor I've ever had. He is demeaning and pretty much calls you dumb when you ask questions. He isn't supportive of his students at all and, while he's an interesting person, he gets sidetracked and talks too much of his personal life sometimes, leaving no time for lecture. He expects you to know the material as soon as he teaches it."
2482,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM242,5.0,4.0,"Ok so I very rarely write reviews on my professors, they all have been just eh! I have written one bad one for a really terrible one in the past at UNLV, and one great one for one of the best professors Ive ever had (also at UNLV). This is quite possibly my 3rd review ever! And its because Professor Hammond is amazing!!! Dont believe the bad!"
2483,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM110,1.0,5.0,He is a genius professor but really strict and if you are not like him then you will surely fail as in get a F. His exams does not have multiple choices.
2484,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM242,5.0,4.0,"Professor Hammond is amazing. Compared to any of the organic professors at UNLV, Dr. Hammond is an excellent professor. He helps you pass his class and guides you to pass the ACS final. There are 4 quizzes, 4 tests, and 12 labs totaling 1000 points to be had. He is a fair grader and gives numerous opportunities for extra points. Take this class!"
2485,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121,1.0,4.0,"He knows his chem. But 121 is so easy for him, he thinks it should be easy for you too. Gets sidetracked about comicbooks then rushes through lec. Very disorganized on the board. Lectures, then quizzes you on material the same day. Very demeaning when you ask a question and interrupts you. Makes you feel dumb. Overall, poor. Wouldn't take again."
2486,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121,5.0,4.0,"Professor Hammond is the real deal. If you put the time in and pass, you will come out of his class and have a breeze in 122. He definitely makes you work for your grade, but there is always opportunity for extra points (he doesnt like to call it extra credit). Study with his old exams that he makes accessible and go to his office or the tutor."
2487,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM110121,4.0,4.0,"If you're not a chem major I do not recommend this teacher, he goes the extra mile on everything making problems harder than they need to be. Does not give any homework and if you don't study his practice test or quiz most likely you will fail the class. That being said he is passionate about chem and knows what is talking about. Be ready to Study."
2488,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121L,2.0,4.0,"He is a very tough grader. He has weird ways of teaching and if you are not comfortable with them, it is best to teach yourself. He does not like to answer your questions or he will give you a blank stare."
2489,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121,1.0,5.0,"Very tough professor, don't take him if you have other subjects to juggle. He will consume your time and demand your 100% focus and study time. Exams every day, every week, all test are solving NO MULTIPLE CHOICE since day 1. Lectures are very fast and disorganized."
2490,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM110,5.0,3.0,"As a student who struggled with Chemistry, Mr. Hammonds teaching was clear along with fair grading. The material is heavy on math, along with Chemistry basics. I recommend all students to join a study group, YouTube videos, practice problems, and dont miss class. This class is hard work, but with enough study time you can surely pass."
2491,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121L,4.0,5.0,"Hes very by the book. He is intimidating and not so easy to talk to. I always felt uncomfortable to ask him questions. Tough grader, and goes off topic quite often. Wouldnt take again."
2492,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121,1.0,5.0,"a nice guy, easy to approach. how ever, his lectures are confusing, he has no notes that he uses to organize the notes on the board that's why his notes are always all over the place. he does not follow the syllabus at all so if you miss a class be prepared for a pop up quiz. to take his class make sure you have money and time for private tutoring."
2493,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM241AND242,5.0,1.0,Professor Hammond has a great passion for chemistry. His lectures are amazing. My tip for taking Professor Hammond is to be one step ahead of him in lecture. Treat lectures as a review session after you've studied off the textbook he's recommended to study off of. OChem isn't easy. You must study if you want to earn the grade you want.
2494,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121,1.0,4.0,"Marion Hammond doesn't care for the success of his students. If you do not already understand chemistry, don't bother. If you are a girl, he will interrupt you to explain things you have already stated, without answering your question, and then praise a boy for your correct answers. His teaching is mediocre; expect many anecdotes about raspberries."
2495,579367,Marion,Hammond,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM121,2.0,5.0,"A quiz practically everyday, and they are not easy. He often gives bonus points but even then you are lucky to get a C. He is very picky and not willing to explain what he writes on the board. If you do not listen for one second you will be lost for weeks."
2497,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Pulver was an amazing professor! I enjoyed his class and recommend everyone take him. I took his 6-week summer class and it was loaded with work but if you study and participate, it is not hard and you learn a lot. He is clear on his assignments and when work is due, also he provides tons of extra credit opportunities! TAKE HIM!!"
2498,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1001,1.0,3.0,"Wow. What a nightmare. He lays everything out, sure. But, there is so much crap in the online portal , I cant find half of what I need to find out what to do for the assignments. His assignments ask VERY uncomfortable questions about your personal life. Ive tried emailing for help but he doesnt respond."
2499,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,"I ended up with a 96 with Professor Pulver. His syllabus is very helpful and there is a lot of work tbh, but they're easy. Just give it your time. He gives feedback and lots of extra credit opportunities. DO NOT CRAM AND STUDY ON THE DAY YOUR GONNA TAKE HIS EXAM. Lots of material, homework and you will use the book, but it was very interesting!"
2500,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,3.0,4.0,Dr. Culver has a great personality but he can become monotone in his power points. There's lots of reading and lots of exams. His exams were challenging because he words his questions a different way so you think it's one answer when it's something completely different.
2501,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,"He is one amazing professor. He gives so much extra credit opportunities that if you do an average work you can probably get an A still. You will learn a lot. The only downfall is that it is a lot of group work, and online that is hard because everyone won't participate and it ends up with a lot of work for one person. He is an easy grader. TAKEHIM"
2502,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,4.0,Lots of reading. easy quizzes and hard exams. tried very hard to get the A
2503,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pulver online 16 week course is well organized and structured. There is alot of work to be done, but he always gives out extra credit. He will be able to give out redo's on exams depending on the overall pass rate for the class. There are group projects, discussion posts, 6 exams, no final. I got an ""A"""
2504,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,3.0,"This Professor was very objective. This class was beyond well-rounded! As long as you put forth effort and participate, you should get an A."
2505,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,4.0,"Currently in his SOC101 online class. He's caring, and gives extra assignments for extra credit points. His modules are easy to understand and follow. You're gonna be reading a lot and you have to understand them. The tests are HARD. Make sure to take notes on every readings and videos given and you'll be fine."
2506,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,2.0,"Professor Pulver himself is a solid choice, it's just the setup of the class that can be difficult. By this I mean that working in groups in an online class can be extremely stressful when it comes to relying on other people to contribute. Other than that, the class was straight forward and organized in a way that helps you pace yourself well."
2507,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,4.0,"Dr Pulver makes it easy to pass the grade with an A. My other classes had been listed as easy As on RMP and I wanted to work in this semester with at least one class. Print everything, even the powerpoints. There was a lot of extra credit available. You can't see your grade until they are turned in which was a little stressful but I still got an A."
2508,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,WMST275,4.0,4.0,"If you take this class online, this course will be divided into different modules that will focus on different aspects of a relationship and families (divorce, communication, conflict resolution). As someone that has had to take this class twice, I would recommend using the money on your student account to print so that you stay ahead."
2509,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,1.0,5.0,"For a sociology class, he had tests on stuff completely off topic of sociology. Tests made no sense, bought a text book for no reason, we didn't even use it. He's trash."
2510,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,4.0,There is a lot of reading and writing assigned throughout this course so it does take up some time and the exams are written to be more thought invoking since they are the only ways you really lose points (unless you don't turn things in). Gives a lot of extra credit opportunities and gives great feedback on assignments. Very nice too.
2511,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,5.0,"Currently taking his class, and as a full time college student, it's a painful go due to the heavy load of work, but he's a VERY nice and caring person, so it makes the strenuous workload bearable. Exams are difficult as the questions are testing you on applying sociology rather than simply knowing it, so understanding the material is vital."
2512,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,4.0,I took this class summer 2017 with 2 more subjects plus  a full time 5 days of 8 hours work. He had a lot of assignments and things to do in the list. Very inspirational and I learned a lot from him. I got a grade of A and he grades according to how you have participated. I would gladly get him again
2513,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,4.0,"Took this professor for my 6 week summer course online. Obviously I knew there would be more work since it's such a short semester, but his work is insane. Defiantly not material for a 101 class. You always feel behind even if you're doing everything right. Would not recommend if you get stressed easily."
2514,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,4.0,This Professor starts out the course just right by moving straight to the chapter that can get us immersed quickly and feeling very motivated early on. He inspires us to use our own brain and not just mimic exactly what he wants or thinks in each assignment. He is just silly enough to make him lovable and just serious enough to really know stuff!!
2515,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,WMST275,4.0,2.0,"He wrote his own book, but it's more like a series of essays on separate files on a disk. Really frustrating. Lots of reading. He's a generous grader. Discussions are graded by your ""group"". Missed an exam and he reached out to me and opened it back up before I even had to ask. He's a really nice guy and wants you to succeed in his class."
2516,488882,John,Pulver,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,3.0,4.0,I'm sorry but he is a horrible professor when it comes to grading. He doesn't post any grades for us to see throughout the whole semester and there is way too much work to get done in little time. The exams are too long 80 questions in 80 minutes? I don't get done in time because the questions are too long and some don't even cover what we learned.
2518,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,"This professor is a joke. She does not give clear, if any, instructions for assignments or helpful feedback, all you get is OK or a bad grade. If you aren't Hemingway or a mind reader, don't waste your time."
2519,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,4.0,"Gives little to no feedback and if she does, it isn't helpful. Good luck understanding anything, she does not respond to emails and if she does she'll make sure you're aware how incompetent you are."
2520,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,BEWARE! Honestly stay away from her. She grades very strictly. Is not clear at all in what the assignments need to be. Theres been multiple times where I have to ask other people and they say the same.
2521,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor for ENG 102. She does not give instruction, just example. Like what? My mom is a professor at SUU and she doesn't understand this professor at all. I even had my mom sit down and basically do my assignment with me and I got a 60% .. I really suggest not taking this teacher. She is literally the worse I have seen."
2522,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,4.0,"One of the WORSE teachers I have had. She barely gives a rubric and if she does, its VERY minimal. I have taken 4 week and have got A's but this class is just too much. She doesn't respond to emails at all. I haven't learned anything so far from her class because her responses don't make sense. Don't take her if you actually want to learn. Simple."
2523,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,"I advise not taking her. She is the worst. Her assignments could be easy if she gave you directions on how to do them. The Syllabus is your friend here, it will tell you what pages to read for your assignments. She dislikes being contacted and is rude if you do contact her. If I didn't need this class I would drop it."
2524,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,2.0,"Worst english class ever taken. Instructions for every single assignment are unclear and absolutely nothing is TAUGHT, you are just expected to be a novelist by your first assignment. Don't expect anything to be graded in a timely manner, its the 3rd month of school and I have had 4 assignments total.. do with that what you will :)"
2525,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,4.0,4.0,"The instructor is not friendly, but she does her job, and will crankily make sure you know how to write well and follow directions. This teacher was excellent at preparing me for future classes."
2526,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG235,4.0,3.0,"Its an English class so expect papers and reading. Overall an easy class if you enjoy reading long readings. We did use the book, so be prepared to buy it. Try and find it used already way cheaper. The only ""bad"" thing is she is a SLOW grader, but still a good professor."
2527,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,4.0,"Instruction was never clear, but students were expected to complete papers flawlessly nonetheless. Professor is politically charged, and rude to students when they get things wrong or ask questions. In 12 years of schooling, this was by far the worst English class I'd ever taken. All work is done on paper as well, do with that what you will."
2528,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG235,4.0,3.0,"Her syllabus is admittedly vague, so make sure to triple check to make sure you have all criteria mentioned. You have a lot of academic and creative license to write. This course is entirely what you make of it, she doesn't do any direct lectures so it's a lot of reading and question answering."
2529,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,4.0,3.0,"I really liked this class and the prof's assignments. You have group peer reviewing each class on your homework assignment. She isn't very clear on some of the instructions for the assignments but if you ask her after class, she'll explain more. I would take this class again because I love her discussions and her views on the topics we talk about."
2530,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,4.0,"Shes a tough grader, and is not clear with her instructions. Her syllabus is a mess and cant be trusted if you missed class. Very crabby and rude lady. Barely responds to emails. Assignments arent terribly hard, but there is no rubric, so dont expect an A unless youre a pro writer. Overall would not recommend. Avoid at all costs"
2531,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG231,4.0,2.0,"I took this as a 4 week summer course. She doesn't explain where to get each story from. She needs to clarify in her syllabus which version of each story she wants her students to read to minimize confusion (no textbook). Also, a few assignments she should've been more clear on. Amount of reading required was manageable while working fulltime."
2532,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG231,1.0,5.0,"I took ENG231 as a 4 week summer course, this professor has extremely vague instruction and is wishy washy with her grading. She grades tough and if she doesnt like your reading responses she just docks points and gives either no feedback, or very vague feedback. For one of my assignments she said she didnt read it all the way &amp; still docked pts."
2533,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG231,1.0,5.0,Her directions are vague and so is her feedback. Its hard to understand what she truly wants since she gabes you really basic instructions. 10/10 do not recommend. The first prof to ever give me an F on a paper ï¿½ï¿½
2534,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG231,1.0,2.0,"Easy assignments, terrible professor. Syllabus offered no criteria for how she grades. Assignments are straightforward but without a rubric, you have no idea what she's looking for outside the basics, so she'll dock you points if she doesn't like your interpretation of her analysis questions. When she answers your emails, she is curt and rude."
2535,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG231,5.0,2.0,"Loved this course! As a four week summer class online, I was able to do all of the work each week within one day. You read about two plays a week (FREE ONLINE PDFS), then answer 8-12 questions based on the reading about simple plot points. One discussion post per week, 400 word minimum, which is quite simple once you read the plays/poems. EASY A!"
2536,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,"AWFUL, AWFUL prof. Taken as an online summer course, class was extremely hard for such a short term. She gives vague unhelpful feedback, and is such a tough grader. After not receiving a high grade on the first of MANY papers, I looked for feedback and fixed it on the next to only experience bad grades after another for the rest of the semester."
2537,887860,Elisabeth,McLaren,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG231,1.0,4.0,"Professor is not clear about her instructions on syllabus. She also comments ""Good Work"" on assignments without probably even reading them. She does this when she has already decided that you're failing. I only realized that after looking at grade on MyCSN. I would never recommend this professor for ENG231. There are others who teach it online too."
2539,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,1.0,5.0,"I wouldn't recommend him, his tests are timed and hard 30 to 40 min. doesn't give us a study guide, he makes us download a stupid browser to take the test called lockdown, a lot of discussion messages, we have to sign in 9:00 am on time for 10 points! the only good thing he did is giving us the online book link for $60.00"
2540,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ270,5.0,2.0,"Loved Professor Aberle. One review question was due a week and they were easy to answer with a quick google search or finding the section in the book. The textbook can be found online in PDF form which makes it easier. The four quizzes use a lockdown browser with no camera, so it's easy to use your book during it to pass. Overall great."
2541,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ270,4.0,3.0,"I took Aberle for 104, 270, &amp; am planning to take him again for 225. His grading criteria is clear, assignments are reasonable &amp; actually help understand concepts. Lockdown browser is required for all tests, closed book (which doesn't make sense for ESSAY tests but whatever). I recommend his online class very heavily."
2542,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,3.0,4.0,"currently in class right now, he makes us download a lockdown browser so we cant use any sources to help us on the test, including notes! gets upset if you don't show up to online meetings its also worth 10 points, I paid 60 dollars for the online textbook, two Quizzes and two Exams are timed! he does not accept late work"
2543,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,3.0,4.0,"Hes an average professor with annoying aspects to his class that make me wish I took someone else. For example, he puts these really annoying restrictions on your assignments that feel like micromanagement and make assignments unnecessarily complicated. Particularly for his discussion posts. I wish I took someone else. He doesnt grade on opinion."
2544,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ270,5.0,1.0,"I recommend taking this class if you need to balance your schedule. It does require some effort, but it's pretty straight forward. You will need the textbook since there's a weekly assignment from the text. The quizzes are closed book, and discussion are graded. As long as you try, you should get an A."
2545,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,2.0,"He was basically following the textbook. As long as you can remember vocab terms the tests will be fairly easy. A few papers, but they're opinion based. His experienced background and his stories help to remember certain aspects and make the class interesting. Honestly he's a great teacher and I feel like a learned a lot from his class."
2546,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,3.0,"Great lectures and great story telling. I like when he shares his experiences in the force and always relates it to the lecture (never just rambles on about unrelated nonsense). Not a hard class to pass. Take notes, study the textbook, and write your essays and youll pass."
2547,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,1.0,"Hes very easy going and lenient. His assignments are fairly easy and mindless as well. However, I suggest actually reading all of the textbook material for the best grade possible. Although I got an A in the class, I never got an A on a test, mostly low Bs because the tests are timed and I skimmed the textbook. Extra credit available too"
2548,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. He has a large background in criminal justice, making him knowledgable about the subject. The information on the slides he teaches off of comes straight from the textbook, so just pay attention in class and you'll be fine. There's two 1,000 word papers and an extra credit paper. I didn't buy the textbook and I easily passed."
2549,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,4.0,3.0,"If you follow the syllabus you do well, and watch the dates things need to be done by. The quiz/tests were a challenge because there was a lot to review and no real guide as to what might be on the quiz/test."
2550,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,4.0,3.0,If you do the work as instructed you get 100%.
2551,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,1.0,3.0,"his exams/midterms are not accurate on what info will be on them so you can be prepared. For example, Quiz #2 covers chapters 7-9 but it has information you don't even cover until chapter 10 on the test? He needs to structure his class better. He also gives NOTHING to reference for where/why you lost points. Otherwise easy class, workload minimal"
2552,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,3.0,2.0,"It's a good class, clear criteria however be aware when he says he wants your opinion, he'll bunk you if he doesn't agree with your opinion. Abuse of power in my opinion but! apparently opinions dont matter to him LOL. Outside of that, easy class and enjoy the readings."
2553,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ101,5.0,2.0,"Class is really great if youre looking for an easier A for a criminal justice class. There is an assignment every week due on Sunday, these assignments being very easy. A quiz/test thats here and there and discussion posts. Though, he doesnt really give feedback, hes not that strict, to me, on grading."
2554,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,1.0,"I would say if you're a CRJ major or even thinking about making it your major, take Aberle. In his lectures, he talks about his experience in the police force and gives you perspective on a lot. Easy book work, take him!"
2555,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ107,4.0,2.0,"Aberle is a really easy professor, however his lectures are EXTREMELY BORING. I wouldn't recommend him as a morning class (and I usually only take mornings). He's a pretty easy grader, but his tests are difficult. This is not a ""study later"" type of class, you will need to be prepared."
2556,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,3.0,Good professor. Easy class. Do the assignments. Chapter review questions result in a couple hundred word short essays. Two writing assignments that were big. Discussion posts were interesting and easy. Tests were trickier but doable.
2557,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,2.0,"Easy class, easy A. Remember to do all discussion posts and replies for full credit. Papers are 2 paragraphs due once a week. PowerPoint online accessible for notes and studying if you need them and overall really interesting class with fun topics to discuss with the class. I actually learned something"
2558,734391,Robert,Aberle,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CRJ104,5.0,3.0,"Grades quickly. A lot of the links are broken in his online class but the tests are based on the book and his lecture slides. It's an intro class, was pretty interesting."
2559,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSCH101,5.0,1.0,This was by far the easiest class I have ever had in my college education. You literally learn nothing and still get an A. If your a slacker this was the class to take. Lowest grade he gave students was a C that's if you choose not to do the APA style paper he assigns. Unfortunate he is no longer with the school anymore. Great professor
2560,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"I miss Dr. Solomon very much, he was one of the most inspirational people I've had the honor to come to know, and it deeply saddens me that he left the college.  Solomon cared about all of his students and his final hurrah for all of us was a beautifully orchestrated boycott of the college to defend our rights.  CSN's greatest treasure by far.   "
2561,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,He was an amazing teacher who clearly cares deeply about his students. I am glad to have been in his last semester class at CSN.
2562,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Solomon has been the most inspiring,and empowering professors I had ever met. His compassion for the students and passion for psychology clearly shows throughout the semester.Iam saddened to hear he had to resign, but I understand and support his decision. He's all about protecting the goodness in humanity. I'm honored&amp;privileged to know him"
2563,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH241,5.0,2.0,Best teacher I have had at CSN. We had to research and present on a specific psychiatric diagnosis. Great sense of humor. Made me feel better about myself.
2564,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,2.0,"Can't say enough good things about Prof Solomon &amp; class. Liked not using traditional text. First day of class he announced ""If you want a traditional psych class this in not the place for you.""  Emphasized ""thinking out-side the box"". Used every day events to discuss psych issues. Liked learning APA style writing which I had not learned before."
2565,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,2.0,"Can't say enough good things about Prof Solomon &amp; class. Liked not using traditional text.

Liked learning APA style writing which I had not learned before."
2566,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH101,2.5,1.0,"This was his last semester and I hate to say that I'm happy about it. He was constantly talking about himself, I learned more about APA format than I did about Psychology.. It wasn't a traditional class, which would have been amazing if I could have learned what I had payed for, it was a complete waste of money, besides getting the credits for it.."
2567,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,Solomon is a very caring teacher. He wants the best for his students you can literally not do anything in the class and  he will still give you a C.But attendance is mandatory!There is no final or quizzes. The only thing you have to do is a 10 page paper and it's really simple!
2568,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"Easy A! funny guy, no final exam, no quizzes and the lowest grade that he will EVER give is a C... best teacher"
2569,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"He's a great teacher, Very helpful he cares about his students and goes the extra mile to help his students."
2570,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,Best of the best.  Money well spent.
2571,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"Great class. Show up, listen, participate and you will get a lot out of it!"
2572,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,2.5,1.0,"His class was easy and he is a funny guy, but I don't think it was a class worth paying for. You don't learn anything really and he doesn't teach much of anything. You mostly just learn from the presentations given by the others in the class. Although he is a nice guy I just would rather take a class where I actually learn something."
2573,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY241,5.0,1.0,"BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER HAD!! Dr. Solomon is funny,keeps things interesting and makes class a very enjoyable expierence, wish he taught more classes he is the best teacher @ CSN"
2574,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"awesome dude definitely recommend him , easy class , no homework &amp; just one easy paper to write , attendance is necessary but no textbook required, he's super funny &amp; down to earth :) I would take him all over again if i could !"
2575,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"Greatest professor of all time. The easiest class with no work, yet made me think the most. I looked forward to every single class he provided. Hilarious and if you can't take a joke don't take this class. Recommending everyone who needs PSY to take Doc Solomon. Definitely think outside the box.. Really don't have anything negative to say."
2576,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher I have had at CSN. He is brilliant and changed my way of thinking of school and life in general. He inspired me to change my degree to PSY. Great guy, fun class."
2577,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.0,1.0,Definitely not the typical psychology class BUT it's very easy! Probably one of my most favorite teachers! He's very personable and open! Definitely take this class!
2578,344280,Gary,Solomon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Psychology,PSY101,4.5,1.0,"Awesome and entertaining. Make sure to participate and 'think outside the box', unless you want a lame class."
2580,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,"Four speeches total, each speech connects to each other. Very simple class, one assignment do every 1-2 weeks. You just have to send a speech outline, then record the video and post it on YouTube. He has detailed step by step instructions to help."
2581,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,2.0,4.0,"This professor is very tough at grading. Unclear instructions, isnt helpful with questions and speeches must be turned in 2 days before the due date - Professor James. Since he wants all videos uploaded to YouTube and it takes very long and is unpredictable, however he doesnt care. Deadline for this class is also 11pm for all assignments."
2582,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,4.0,2.0,"Instructor gives clear and concise instructions with all assignments. As long as you follow those instructions, you'll do fine."
2583,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,4.0,"Professor James is not just thorough, he is meticulous in what he delivers and doesnt expect it back right away yet he tries to build you up to that degree of meticulousness. I wish all teachers were as detailed. Wish I had taken the in person course as it seems he has a good sense of humor! He has a lot to give -if your willing to do the work!"
2584,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,"Professor James is one of the best teachers I have ever taken online. His grading criteria and feedback were crystal clear. For online you need 9 people to present your speech in front of, he made that easier by making a forum for all his students to communicate. He's strict but honest! He really cares and wants you to pass, I would take him again!"
2585,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,2.0,4.0,"He's a really tough grader. I took it as an online class and there was a lot of requirements for everything. He says he knows public speaking is number one fear yet he makes this class so difficult. Answers to quizzes are on quizlet. Prepare to do a lot of research (do it ahead of time for your own good, don't procrastinate). 4 speeches in total."
2586,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COMM101,2.0,5.0,"He is a passive aggressive professor so communication is difficult. I had to beg for a face to face meeting. He takes off 5 points for each error in your speech, there's a list of about 50 errors that you can make so the negative points add up quickly and will cause your A+ to sink to a D very quickly. Do Not Take this class online."
2587,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,1.0,1.0,Awful
2588,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,1.0,1.0,Tough Grader
2589,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,1.0,4.0,"Gives you a ""How-to"" handout OVER 100 PAGES! That's how specific he wants you to be when it come to these videos (was online class so we had to do a vid of our speeches). If you've had any hard/strict professors before, then you know how its like when you go out of your way to do things THEIR way but still get a bad grade when you miss ONE thing"
2590,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,3.0,4.0,Such a tough grader. Like ridiculously tough. But a nice guy overall.
2591,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,4.0,3.0,"This professor is very strict about what he wants, however this is a good thing in his case. This means you know exactly what to do when making a speech. Anyway, you read a few chapters of the book, take a test, read a couple lecture slides, read the speech instructions, and prepare the outline for the speech and make the speech. Only 4 speeches."
2592,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,4.0,3.0,"Very easy class but what gets you is the ATTENDANCE If you are are late you have a deduction of 15 points (think of it like missing a quiz) If you are absent you get a letter grade deduction (From A, if you are absent a B) essentially only 3 absences before getting a grade of D LOCKS the doors after 5 minutes so essentially being absent"
2593,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,4.0,"VERY SPECIFIC. Alot of people were frustrated with how specific Prof. James' speech instructions were but they left very little room for error if followed correctly. He grades tough but that's because he wants things done a certain way. Print out the speech recording requirements and just follow them to the T. Overall, good course."
2594,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,"Took his 8wk class; it was great! Criteria is fast-paced, but well-organized. Had 4 major speeches; 3 of them were one speech split into sections. He provides an EXACT outline &amp; all you need to do is delete his content &amp; add yours. Quizzes + final are online &amp; all have EXACT study guides to them. He works to make public-speaking less terrifying."
2595,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,Best Professor iv'e had in such a long time. It is such a straight forward class. I highly recommend this class. Dr. James will definetly keep you entertained the whole class. Best part of it all he makes having to give a speech less scary.
2596,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,4.0,3.0,I took his class as an 8 week class so it was fast paced. Everything was online except lectures and speeches. The hardest part of his class was the research. The outlines he had us follow were well done and easy to follow. He has a lot of criteria for speeches which can be hard to meet at times. He gives exact study guides for every test/ quiz.
2597,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,4.0,"This class shed a lot of new &amp; important light on the fundamentals of communication. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The only thing I regret is not being able to take the class in-person. For the accelerated. course, there were 4 speeches, outlines for each and exams on the reading material. Very caring and organized instructor."
2598,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,1.0,"Professor James is one of the greatest instructors I ever had. He's clear about what he wants and expects for the class. Public speaking is something that I've dreaded but Prof. James really helps you if you have anxiety. There are 4 speeches total, accompanied by outlines, 3 mini-speeches, 5 quizzes and the final. PLUS he gives extra credit."
2599,456239,Timothy,James,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,He is a grate professor. attendant matters. there will be few speeches to do and its pretty fun.
2601,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,2.0,I took her English 223-Literature of the American Midwest. Weekly discussion boards regarding the lectures &amp; reading packet she supplies. We concurrently read a book &amp; had to apply both the short stories &amp; book together in our posts. She gives good feedback &amp; outlines her grading process clearly. She was a great professor! I recommend her class!
2602,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,2.0,1.0,Lots of reading. The work was easy. I enjoyed some of the class readings. There are discussions every week and quizzes every 4 weeks. My only issue is: 1) she doesn't grade work in a timely matter. Sometimes she took over a month to grade work. 2) She doesn't respond in a timely matter also with email. 3) &amp; she deducted points for petty reasons.
2603,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,3.0,4.0,"She is a very nice lady that nit picks on the little things. If you are looking to take an easy English class this is not the one to take. She's also the kind of professor that always makes sure she's available to help if you need it. With that being said, be aware of the style of her class and the style you personally prefer before enrolling."
2604,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,5.0,4.0,"Best English teacher I'ver ever had. Took this class during the summer fast paced and I loved it. We had weekly discussions with a quiz due every sunday, a midterm, and a Final, and she even offers extra credit if you have +70%+, I didn't take this opportunity and I kinda regret it. If you're willing yo put it in the work, you will love her class!!"
2605,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG242,2.0,4.0,It was an okay class. I have had better English professors. I would will not recommend (take Rosenthal) Henkel seems really moody. Lots of reading.
2606,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,Class was always active so it was never boring. She always is clear and explains everything and makes sure everyone understands. She works with her students and makes sure they succeed . I took her for both 98 and 101 and I don't regret it at all.
2607,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,1.0,2.0,"Starts the first few weeks of class being nice and easy to follow, then changes the lesson plan without telling anyone else, and gets mad at YOU for not doing the thing she didnt tell you to do. Will just stop teaching and tell the whole class to leave if shes angry, and assigns extra work as punishment. If you value your time, dont take this class"
2608,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG242,5.0,3.0,Easy class. Weekly discussions. You can skim the readings (which are usually 10 pages or less). Be sure to meet the word count and include quote/page number and you'll be fine. Quizzes are super easy. Take this class.
2609,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG098,3.0,2.0,"Easy class ,However if you're looking to get something out of this trust me you won't. 3 essays and 1 letter at the end. She requires you to read papers but sooner or later she stops. She talks way too much to the point where you won't have time to do your assignments in class."
2610,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG098,2.0,1.0,"she has the tendency to ramble on about about stuff that is totally irrelevent to the class. Nasal. Boring. HOWEVER -- If you know how to bs, she will give you easy As. Do not take if you want to actually learn something."
2611,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,5.0,1.0,Shes truly the best I wish I could have her for all my English classes throughout college. Shes super nice and cares about all her students . When she is out sick her husband subs for her and hes amazing and funny as well their great people. Her class was very easy and we only took one final that was five random questions like what was her name
2612,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,5.0,2.0,"What I really liked about the class was the fact that I only had to log in once a week to complete a discussion post about the reading that was assigned that week. There are 4 quizzes, a mid-term, and a final exam. I would recommend that you get familiar with the readings to do good on the quizzes and exams. I could've received an A, but got lazy."
2613,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,5.0,1.0,"LOVE HER! She was so helpful and understanding. Very easy grader! She honestly cares about each student and will try as hard as she can to help. If you aren't good at english, i would HIGHLY suggest that you take this class. Fun assignments, interesting discussions, and lots of group interaction. She was one of the best teachers i've ever had!"
2614,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG098,5.0,2.0,"Took this class online which was super easy as long as you do what is requested. Typically, one discussion question per week plus one homework assignment or test. Three major essays that are only about two pages long and three timed essays. At the end of the course she gives extra credit and is always willing to help or give feedback."
2615,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,"This class is really easy. She is super nice and her class is just lectures about papers. There are some group work and attendance is mandatory. However, only did couple of papers the semester besides showing up to class. Very nice and helpful."
2616,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,4.0,2.0,"There is a lot of reading since it's an English class, but as long as you at least try then it's a pretty easy class. She's clear on her grading and what she wants and she even gives an extra credit assignment at the end. And the textbook is definitely used but it's pretty cheap to rent so that's not really a problem."
2617,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,4.0,2.0,"I took her 6 week summer course along with 3 other classes and this class was manageable. 22 graded assignments: 15 discussion posts (12 pertaining to the course packet, 3 pertaining to the book Destiny of the Republic), 4 quizzes (no final exam), 2 reading responses (minimum of 500 words), and participation grade."
2618,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,"She is such a great professor &amp;  I learned a lot in her class. Comparing myself from the beginning of the semester to the end,  definitely saw results. Great class discussions. She gave 3 essays during the semester along with a couple of quizzes. Flexible &amp; offers extra credit. She is also very interesting to listen to, very smart. Good feedback"
2619,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,5.0,1.0,Easy A! The readings were easy and most took less than 45 minutes to read. Weekly 200 word discussion along with two 80 word student responses. 4-5 easy ten question quizzes. NO PAPERS! There was a midterm and final that were super easy. She even offers an extra credit paper. My Canvas was acting up and she was always flexible about it! Great class
2620,803580,Elizabeth,Henkel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,1.0,4.0,Be very careful for pop quizzes. she is the only person allowed to miss class. If you miss class she will be very upset and find ways to punish you. Does not follow syllabus and if you don't participate don't plan to take this class.  She says no phones allowed in class that your family can call the main csn number if there is an emergency.
2622,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,1.0,3.0,"the classes are not even lectures theyre just debates on what he thinks about a certain topic. Whenever he grades assignments, I think he gives grades based on what your views on politics are. He is so biased on what he teaches &amp; what he wants you to write about, it feels like hes pushing his political views into students."
2623,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,1.0,3.0,A majority of assignments in this course were very political and one assignment even required that you have Netflix in order to do a report on a documentary on institutional racism. Many questions on the midterm and final exam were pertaining to his own personal beliefs and opinions and the questions on the exams were worded in a convoluted way.
2624,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,4.0,2.0,"This classes assignments include lots of online discussions on random life topics, 13 chapter worksheets, credit plan, a daily planner (checked 3 times), 2 tests, a final exam, and lots of extra credit opportunities. Funny professor and genuinely cares about his students."
2625,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,1.0,2.0,LOOK the biggest thing was that this teacher expects you to have the book the SECOND day you start the class and in a four week class which is ridiculous! He doesnt give you much opprotunity for doing the work. Homework due at random times ALL AT ONCE and unorganized grading modules. Horrible grading TAKE ANY OTHER Teacher but ALS is easy for credi
2626,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,"Excellent Professor. He does play devil's advocate and his discussion allow his students to really think about their political perspectives. There are 4 tests and 4 papers. Attend his classes because he will be telling you what he wants you to write on your papers, therefore, you WILL get an A. Use your notes for tests."
2627,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,1.0,4.0,"I took the online class so I can't vouch for his in-class personality, but purely from the assignments I have to give this class an Awful rating. No videos are posted, there's way too much homework (which is all mindless copying out of the book), and I got the feeling that Mr. Tarkanian just doesn't care that much about the class (many typos etc)"
2628,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,1.0,3.0,"Here I thought I was going to get a ""Tark the Shark"" Jr. he's nothing that his last name lives up to. Hard grader and tester, doesn't go over Canvas or the CSN website and has test questions that are outside of the book so read and re-read because ""it's in there"" is the only answer you'll get from him."
2629,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,2.0,"Professor Tarkanian is a great professor, most of his test is in his lecture so come to class, sadly you still need the notebook though. He will always play devils advocate on your political opinion to keep you on your toes."
2630,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Tarkanian is the funniest teacher I ever had. Most people think he's rude because of the way he presents himself, but really he's just a very sarcastic, very dry humored man. If you take this course, be prepared to argue and argue well. Stay on top of the news. Even though attendance is voluntary, show up! Some things aren't in the book."
2631,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,3.0,4.0,4 papers. 4 exams (online and open book). Lots of homework assignments from textbook. Spends the first hour talking/debating about current events and issues. Lectures for rest of class. Pretty easy grader and sometimes pushes due dates back. Models of Congress - group activity of making our own bills (at the end of the semester). Pretty ok class.
2632,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,3.0,"Attendance isn't mandatory, but assignments based on lectures. He's passionate about politics. Debates are the best in his class. Do not miss assignments, stay engaged in in-class debates, give your best effort and you can pass with an A/B. 4 Online timed Tests, 4 essays (3-5 page), a few online group discussions, class project &amp; EC opportunities"
2633,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ASL101,4.0,3.0,"He is nice but a semi tuff grader, lots of busy work for such a simple subject. The homework was time consuming , lots of reading. The book is mandatory. I missed a few classes but not may. He lectures and is outspoken. If you do all the homework you can get a A. Most homework and participate you will pass."
2634,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Tarkanian is VERY outspoken. He will pick on nearly everyone (in the purpose of learning) and expect you to comment on something. So if youre shy, expect him to call on you. The class itself is extremely easy. He is a great speaker and the things he talks about will get you thinking."
2635,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,4.0,He's a good professor. He also thinks about his students a lot and their schedule!
2636,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,1.0,3.0,"Prof. Tarkanian lets just say this guy cannot stay on topic. His notes are not clear.. he expects you to know what he's talking about. He'll want the class to participate but get ready.. he'll always go against whatever you think (which isn't entirely bad, you know, get brain flowing) but sometimes he cant back up on what he says. wudnt recommend."
2637,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,5.0,1.0,"Strongly recommend this class! Attendance isn't mandatory, however, he covers a lot on the exam. Very passionate, funny, and will tell it how it is which makes the lectures so much fun. Lots of homework, but easy to do. Show participation within class he loves a debater. Easy class and you use the material learned. My favorite class by far!"
2638,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,5.0,1.0,"This prof. has been the greatest Ive ever had. Ive never been some excited to go to class. He ridiculously funny, crazy, screams but all in the name of learning. I passed with a 105.47% due to his extra credit, which he has a lot. even one that boost you up a whole letter grade."
2639,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,2.0,4.0,Tests are open book so you basically don't need to show up although there are some questions that are in lectures. He rambles on and on and even takes up more then the class should. Comes off a bit mean at first but you get used to it. Kind of shoves his political view on you.
2640,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,ALS101,4.0,1.0,Pretty cool dude. Loves his politics and debates so make sure you have a clear head and don't shy away from him. Doesn't get close to his students. Had fun in his class though and liked the debates.
2641,441949,George,Tarkanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Tarkanian is an amazing teacher. He encourages class debates and participation. He does have lecture that is easy to follow. He makes sure we are all in understanding before moving on to the next topic. I really enjoyed the first half of class, when he opens up for general discussion. Pay attention and you will do fine."
2643,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,2.0,"Not sure where most of bad reviews are coming from. Ppl seem to think u can come to class and look at the slides and get an A w/o reading the book or putting work into it whatsoever. This is college, get over it. Use the book, participate, and ask Qs when you dont understand. He gives timely feedback and is so encouraging. Would 100% take again."
2644,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. You will not be intimidated. Very approachable. He is fun, lenient and very helpful. I will recommend his class."
2645,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,2.0,3.0,"He is seriously a wonderful man, but  if you are a visual learner I wouldn't recommend taking him. His powerpoint are all pictures. It was really hard to understand anything. I was practically teaching myself."
2646,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,2.0,3.0,"Wonderful man, NOT a good professor. Power points and study guides are not very helpful. Exams ?'s only cover certain sections and can be confusing. Doesn't answer ?'s clearly. Occasional mistakes so look over your graded work! Says he's available after class, but complains when you come by. Better wait for another professor. Frustrating class."
2647,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,4.0,3.0,Dr. Leary is an amazing man trully respected however not everyone learns from images. Some of us need actual computations. Not a hard class if you read all your chapters and understand the work. Mostly learned on my own and went to class to see what was being covered. If you are not ready to put in work I wouldn't recommend taking anyone's189class.
2648,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189LECTURE,3.0,4.0,"He is a nice guy, it's just that his powerpoints are hard to understand on your own since they are just filled with pictures and videos. You'll have to attend to really understand most of the information"
2649,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189LECTURE,5.0,4.0,"Professor Leary is a very nice person. His lectures aren't too hard to understand as he tries his best to make Bio easy as possible for you to grasp. BIO is not easy by all means, but if your looking for a fair bio professor, Leary is your guy. 4 exams and a final and 7 quizzes online. Gives out great study guides for exams. Be prepared to study"
2650,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189L,5.0,2.0,"I took him for lab, but I wish I would've had him for lecture as well. He mentioned to me that he gives out study guides for all tests/quizzes in his lecture class. Bio 189 is really hard, so I would take any help you can get. The lab part of this class is an easy A especially with this teacher."
2651,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,4.5,3.0,"Professor Leary is very fair. It's a tough class with a lot of information regardless of who you take it with. You have to STUDY. Most tests are multiple choice and he gives very good study guides for each. If you put the effort in, you won't fail. He gives you all the tools you need to pass. I wish he taught other bio classes!"
2652,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,2.5,5.0,"Professor Leary is really nice and wants you to pass, but I just did not like the way he taught. He has powerpoints, but they're mostly just pictures and videos and two or three slides with scattered words. Like everyone says, bio is tough."
2653,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,4.5,3.0,"I would take this professor again; in fact I did 2 times to pass the class. He is very encouraging and patient. He makes himself available for any help. The professor is awesome but the subject is hard. Study Study Study and then read, attend SI groups, attend class, and study some more."
2654,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,3.5,3.0,"This professor is amazing, very clear about what he wants. one thing I regret is at first I did not care for my test grades I would study 30-40 mins before class and earn C's on the exam after the third exam I started to study and got very high B's close to an A. my final grade was a B. if you study and do well on the exams, you will be fine!"
2655,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor! Dr. Leary really wants you to be successful and gives you the tools but YOU have to put in the time and effort, go to SI and study groups, read and you should do good. This is a tough class and he is more than willing to lead you just have to be willing to follow, would take it again. He is such a great professor A+ and so helpful."
2656,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,3.0,Dr. Leary is the professor to have if you're a serious learner.  He takes time to make sure everyone is understanding the material and offers plenty of office hours for any additional help.
2657,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,189,4.5,1.0,"AWESOME PROFESSOR!. He is very helpful when it come to topics you don't understand, highly recommend him"
2658,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO122,2.0,5.0,"Leary is a very nice &amp; genuine guy. He's sweet and funny, but his class is not easy. He tends not to answer questions very well, and is not well with answering emails. Tests are very hard and he always throws trick questions in. This class was a struggle. I worked hard and studied, and ended up with a C."
2659,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO122,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Leary is a wonderful man and an amazing professor. It's always refreshing to see professors who truly have passion for what they do. This class was not always easy, but I had fun. He even invites his students to join future classes on hiking trips, and I plan to take him up on that. Awesome guy. Take him if you get the chance.  "
2660,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189LECTURE,2.0,5.0,I don't think I had the same man you all speak of. He is very kind and genuine but I did not engage at all and neither did my particular class. I wish I would've gotten the same guy but no connection no clarity. Very confused
2661,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,189,4.5,3.0,"Mr. Leary is a genuinely nice  and caring professor. He cares about his students, and wants them to do well. He is very friendly and approachable. This is not an easy class, but if you have to take it, Leary is your guy.  I wish he was teaching Micro. "
2662,209603,Patrick,Leary,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,189,4.5,3.0,"Professor Leary has been my favorite professor i have ever had here at CSN. I only wish he taught micro as well. He is friendly, genuinely cares, and inspiring. Will miss his lectures. "
2664,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,2.0,"Professor Cummings is my favorite Professor so far. The man is hilarious and I looked forward to attending his classes. He is fair with his grading and lets you know exactly how to exceed in his class. He does not give vary many assignments, but every student has a solid grasp of the material through his lectures. I would highly highly recommend!"
2665,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,His class is very easy! One group project and one final exam that is five questions! Watch movies everyday and have discussions! He is very funny and nice!
2666,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,4.0,2.0,"No reading, you watch old movies in class. The grade was based on one group film project and the final exam. The final was only 5 questions."
2667,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,3.0,2.0,"The only true assignment that affects your grade is the video project. As long as you do that and its not completely terrible, you get an A. Other than that, you sit in class and watch some entertaining old movies and he discusses afterward. It is an easy A class. A few assignments through canvas are sent out regarding the Hero's Journey also."
2668,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,4.0,2.0,"Do. The. Readings. Chances are, if you take ENG 232 with Professor Cummings (he's very blunt), you will read The Handmaid's Tale and The Road. The great thing about this class is that Professor Cummings shows the film adaptation of ""The Road"" so the content isn't as dry. You may also watch a few critical episodes of THT during class."
2669,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,all you do is watch old movies ! there is one pop quiz on high noon journey so be there that day ! one MAJOR grade and thats a film 2-8 min long and it can be done in a group or solo and you have to present it to the class !! EASY A!! an amazing teacher.
2670,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,Easy class I've ever taken. We had a group project and thats all he graded. Super easy and hilarious dude. We pretty much watched movies the entire time then at the end he graded our presentations.
2671,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,"No reading, no essays. If you want easy, take him. The one thing I got from this class was an appreciation for old movies. Work load consists of: 60% of your grade is a video project, the rest is between your final (which you are allowed to do in groups, only 6 questions), and 6 discussion posts analyzing movies you watch at home. Take him."
2672,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,GREATEST PROFESSOR! Show up watch movies in class he talks about them 1 group project which is majority of your grade people start leaving class he will ask question at the end of class that covers what he talked about earlier just to see who was there watch 6 movies outside class write a review in canvas take home final with 5 questions only
2673,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,"He honestly talks way to much, but otherwise a great teacher. In this class youll watch 4/5 movies, summarize 6 watch at home films, 1 assignment, create your own film, and a take home exam. It was actually a really cool class definitely recommend him!"
2674,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,2.0,"It's definitely a boring class because we just watch films all the time, but there's no homework and only two written assignments due. An occasional pop quiz at the end of class which is easy. One big group project worth most of your grade. Overall easy class though. You won't need a textbook for this one."
2675,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,4.0,2.0,"All you pretty much do is watch old movies. We had two papers to write answering questions about movies. One big group project, you have to make a short film. Homework is to watch 6 movies and post a summary about it. Pretty easy class. Make sure to go to class because sometimes he takes roll or asks for a name on piece of paper for attendance."
2676,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,"The best professor ever! Easy A Just do the group project which is a short film 4-7 minutes. And a midterm, 8 questions which you can do it at home, very easy. And he really cares about his student. He is very lovely, funny, cool, amazing, and will help you so much! If you can't find a group, he will find you a group. Or you can do your own film!"

2678,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,5.0,1.0,Super easy A and he is probably the funniest professor I've ever had. We only did one presentation the whole semester and that was our final grade. He's really lenient on grading it too.
2679,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,5.0,4.0,He explain all the literature and take care of the students. I love Hamlet and the way we study for this.
2680,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG232,5.0,3.0,Took this class over the summer. Professor Cummins really cares about his students. Overall the class was easy and enjoyable. I loved all the films he showed us and I truly enjoyed the final group project which is what your final grade consist of. It was an hour long presentation which seemed impossible but it was fun and educational.
2681,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,E232,5.0,1.0,Amazing Professor !!!! Easy to get A....  He is very hilarious and very great grader.  Take him if you don't want to do many paper works for class.  And I bet you will be fine and get A even though you are ESL.
2682,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,Really awesome teacher very caring about your situations and will talk to you and see what is going on. Class mainly consisted of watching movies and discussing themes of the 50s which was cool. Very easy but fun class
2683,681159,John,Cummings,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),English,ENG223,5.0,1.0,Really fun class - show up to class for attendance and meeting with the group for your final paper - you watch movies and TV of the 1950s for the whole class and often get out early.
2685,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Waucash is for those who want easy. I liked him because we had 4 tests for the semester and that is all he graded on. All of the answers for the tests he gave were in the textbook and lectures. Even though it is lots of homework, you do not need to do all of it to get an A on the test; I promise if you are ambitious, you will love him."
2686,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,3.0,4.0,He is very specific when it comes to answers. He is a very picky and harsh grader your answer has to be exact or it will be wrong. Took this class online and there are 4 test that are like 40-50 questions none of it is multiple choice. All he does is get articles from safari and he post in on the modules and he post a lot.
2687,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,1.0,4.0,"How does a professor grade your answers to your exams with a response that simply says, ""?"" This is Prof W. Be ready to give the exact answer hes looking for, and also, if you're in the ballpark of the answer, your answer is still wrong. He expects perfectionist answers. Just very unprofessionally carried himself, throughout the course."
2688,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,5.0,2.0,"Took this course as a 4 week online class due to Covid over Summer. Was a TON of reading, but given that its a 4 week history course that was pretty much a given. Only had 4 assignments and they were very easy if you actually read the material. Book was mandatory as some of the questions quoted it. Taking HIST 101 with this prof next term."
2689,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,3.0,"He is a nice guy but will never take him again. He always relies too much on outside sources to do the work for him and his class is extremely boring since he can be monotone. Watch YouTube videos basically the whole semester, like lol, I did not pay hundreds of dollars just to be taught by YouTube. In all honesty, just find another professor."
2690,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,2.0,"He is 10 minutes late to every class. Often, his assigned youtube videos teach more in an hour than he has in a semester. He goes on tangents that are often inaccurate according to the material he assigns. His notes are on a word document that he scrolls through shoddily and often deviates from. I enjoy history, but I could not stand this class."
2691,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,5.0,4.0,"One of the most informative professors Ive ever had. If you arent a history buff, he might seem like hes droning on but he talks about cool historical or worldly knowledge thats stuck with me. He had a couple pop quizzes, which were easy if youre prepared. Its a rewarding course but dont take it if you dont like being forced to try."
2692,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,1.0,2.0,one of the worst history teachers I've had. he did not talk about most of what we were supposed to learn and would make us watch videos most of the time. he would not stay on topic of what he was teaching about and he really talked about himself most of the time. I chose him this past semester because his ratings were high but they're false!!
2693,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,1.0,5.0,"If you are looking for an F for your transcript, then this is the class you'd want to take! He talks throughout the whole entire class and many people would fall asleep! He didn't care about his students and only talked and talked, mostly about himself. I tried so hard in his class by always being in class and taking notes and HE GAVE ME AN F!"
2694,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,4.0,2.0,"Professor Waucaush is really good, not like the rest of the professors Ive had. No annoying assignments or homework, just a little reading and some tests. His tests really arent that hard, and theres only a few of them. Genuinely pay attention and review your notes and youll be good."
2695,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,5.0,3.0,Amazing 101 teacher! he can be hard on his students but he is nothing but fair when it comes to grading. His lessons in history subjects are intresting and always manage to capture your attention. but beware there are pop quizzes in this class
2696,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST260,3.0,3.0,"I leaned as much about Native American History as I would've if I'd read a book or browsed the internet. He talks a lot about himself. Doesn't provide feedback on papers. Lectures are important, reading the textbook is not enough. he emphasizes information that is sprinkled throughout the book. Use the lecture notes he puts out and the study guide"
2697,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,5.0,4.0,"This professor was absolutely amazing! I learned so much! If you plan on skipping class or not paying attention, don't take him. He makes you work HARD! Tons of pop quizzes and he puts you on the spot. However, he is so passionate about the subject he teaches. I am honestly sad that I don't have to take anymore history classes he was awesome!"
2698,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,4.0,4.0,Pay attention and read/study you'll pass. He's challenging but you'll learn something new each class. His tests are directly from the study guides.
2699,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,1.0,5.0,"This guy flat out sucks at giving direction, hell say one thing and then change his mind, I would not recommend him at all too many pop quizzes and does not care that you have other classes to worry about"
2700,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,5.0,4.0,Awesome professor! He is a tough grader but the class is well worth it! Learned so much not only about history 102 but what is going on in todays politics that can be confusing. The professors lectures were never boring!
2701,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,5.0,3.0,"Honestly the best HIST prof I have ever had. He has amazing detailed lectures that sometimes put him behind schedule. Also he is not afraid to really show the dark elements in any time frame, this includes pictures so beware. It really shows in the class discussions that he really cares about his field. Wish I needed his other classes!"
2702,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,1.0,5.0,I havent missed a day in this class &amp; Ive NEVER failed a class in my life. He is NOT specific AT ALL when it comes to what is going to be on the final/midterm/pop quizzes. He expects you to read multiple chapters&amp;go by notes but wont tell you exactly what it is on!! Whats funny is I passed my other Hist101 class with a B but failed this class.
2703,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,4.0,4.0,Professor Waucaush's class was fun to take. He is a pretty funny guy and loves to teach. 10 total pop quizzes so be ready. He didn't put grades on canvas was annoying but i just kept everything he handed back to keep track of my grade. Does have extra credit which did help. Study guides for exams and quizzes which had everything on it.
2704,1186420,Chad,Waucaush,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,4.0,4.0,Professor Waucash is hilarious and has a great understanding of history. There was a lot of pop quizzes and some writing assignments. He never posted grades on Canvas so you never really know what your grade is unless you ask him.
2706,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,2.0,"I was nervous taking IS 101 because there was a lot of reviews that said it was a hard class to pass in general. IS 101 covers Microsoft, Excel, and PowerPoint in depth. Luckily for me it wasnt hard because Im computer illiterate. Professor Pete cares about his students and wants you to pass. I highly recommend taking his class."
2707,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Pete is great! I took IS101 online because of COVID, but he was always available by email to answer my questions and is very quick to respond. He definitely wants all of his students to get A's. The class is a lot of modules and projects, but it's not hard. If this class is a requirement for you, definitely take Professor Pete."
2708,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,2.0,"Took this class just to get full time credit. Great and patient instructor. Very easy going, and lets you know upfront how he likes to run class. There for any and all questions and will take time out of class to help others if need be (not always a good thing though). If you feel you can pass the tests ahead of time, he will let you."
2709,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,1.0,"I took Professor Aleman on my first semester at CSN, and he was my favorite. The three tests are easy to pass, especially the second one. Professor Aleman was a great guy and respects his students. If you need to take IS101 take him. Your grade is based off of whether you pass the three tests or not. Pass all the testsA, don't pass themF"
2710,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,3.0,1.0,"This course was a waste.  If you have to take it, take it with this professor.  Hes a great professor for those that dont know how to use these simple applications (basically, MS Office).  More importantly, he provides all the materials for those who already know how to use these applications and want to finish the course early.  Recommend!"
2711,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Pete rocks! His lectures are helpful and you do the assignments at your own pace. If you can pass the tests early, you dont have to go to class anymore!"
2712,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,4.0,3.0,"What was great about this class with Professor Pete Aleman was that, once you pass your 3 ic3 exams you don't have to show up to class any longer! I literally learned a lot more in his class then I did in Professor Patrica Drevons, how ever you spell her name. He really shows you everything. Great Guy! Take him for CSN IS101!"
2713,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,2.0,This is a pass (A) or fail (F) course where you take 3 tests and get a computer literacy certificate for passing them all. Must pass them all to get an A but you can buy another test code and try again. The SAM assignments and GMetrix helped me the most. I didn't use the book but I needed the SAM code inside to watch the videos. Great professor! :)
2714,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,4.5,1.0,"He gives no homework and no assignments, you just have to pass the certification exam. It's 3 tests (40 questions each) that you have to do onsite. Just do them all in the same day and you will get an A. If you don't do all of them, you fail. If you know computing basics it will be easy. I googled study material and didn't even buy the book."
2715,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,2.0,"He is straightforward and organized. You have to pass 3 tests to get an A. You can repeat tests but you have to wait 48 hours, so dont wait to the last week because you may run out of time. The first test seem to me the most difficult, I found the book very helpful, better than videos from SAM web"
2716,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,4.5,2.0,"This is a pass or fail class! There are 3 exams you have to pass to get an A, If you fail you can buy another voucher and try again. The professor gave us free practice test voucher on request, but beware some of the practice tests are harder than the actual test! He truly sets you up to succeed by providing study material &amp; unit guide lines."
2717,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,3.5,4.0,"Theres 3 test you have to take you pass them all you get an A. BUT if you dont know Word, Excel, or Acess get ready to READ AND STUDY ON YOUR OWN TIME. He is such a sweet guy but he will not teach you all you need to know for the tests in class too much to cover If you dont pass all the test you fail the class super nice guy easy A  otherwise."
2718,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,1.0,3 Tests. You pass them you get an A. Simple as that.
2719,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,4.5,1.0,"Pete is incredibly down to earth, and straight to the point. All you have to do is pass the exams, and you're good to go. Answers any questions given, and is always willing to help."
2720,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,1.0,"Professor Pete is very helpful, his IS 101 class has no homework and only 3 tests.  The tests are passfail.  You pass all 3 tests and you receive an A.  You are able to retake the tests as many times as you want.  If you need extra help he is more than willing to help.  He is excellent.  His class is extremely easy."
2721,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,1.0,"You have three tests. To get an A you need to pass these three tests on the first try. You do not need to attend class after you pass these three tests. The textbook for IC3 is not required, but is recommended. I did not buy it because it was too expensive and not necessary. I tested out of the class easily. Professor can be cocky, but he's nice."
2722,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,1.0,AWESOME PROFESSOR ! I LOVED HIM. He was so adorable and sweet and was very helpful. learned a looooot :)
2723,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,1.0,"Easy.  Almost no homework, only about an hour of it each week, which you just do in class. Tests are relatively easy. This class is basic computer stuff that everyone should know how to do anyways. He is the most friendly professor ever."
2724,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,5.0,1.0,"I took this class online. It was the easiest A I've ever gotten. You have 5 tests. If you pass them all with 75 or better you get an A. You get 3 chances per test too, which makes it impossible to fail even if you have never used word, excel, and powerpoint. Just do the tutorials and skim the book. No due dates, just finish tests by end of semester"
2725,330273,Pete,Aleman,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Computer Science,IS101,3.5,2.0,He is very polite and nice to every student. He answer you questions patiently.
2727,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POLYSCI101,5.0,3.0,Great teacher. Thought provoking. Keeps his home and work life separate. No political bias.
2728,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Peplowski was really cool. I'm glad I took this class with him. Political Science isn't a subject I am particularly interested in, but I did learn a lot in his class. I really wish he would use some visual aids to teach, because generally he just lectured the whole class without any notes. Lectures were interesting. Great guy! Take him!"
2729,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC257,5.0,3.0,"He is awesome, knowledgeable and inspirational. He is a soft grader just communicate with him if you can't make class. Different interesting projects, no book this fall semester 2017, not a lot of writing , one major paper essay at the end of semester. He explains things and loves feedback. I dreaded taking this class but so glad I did with him :)"
2730,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POL101,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher , by far the best Ive took , such a sweet man ! Super helpful with questions , tests are easy and all covered by study guides , only con is class is about 2 hours , could be boring sometimes but hes a pretty cool guy ! Only about 5 test(last is take home test ) and some pop quizzes if NO ONE answers his question so make sure to read"
2731,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC295,5.0,2.0,"This course is the Washington DC externship and if you ever have an opportunity to join him on a trip to DC, DO IT! It was an experience of a lifetime and his connections with people in the political world is astounding and a great learning opportunity. You will do and see so much that you would never get to do without Professor Peplowski."
2732,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POLI101,5.0,3.0,Mr. pep is awesome! He knows poli sci inside and out! He always has awesome guest speakers and interesting assignments that are relevant to current events.
2733,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,3.0,Very kind and compassionate professor. I really enjoyed all the guest speakers he brings in. This professor really knows his stuff.
2734,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POLSCI101,5.0,4.0,"Professor Peplowski is an awesome professor, you know when every test is going to be, he gives study guides, and great lectures. Dont miss class, pay attention and youll pass!"
2735,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,2.0,"Good professor, very knowledgeable, can get a bit loud at times but its just enthusiasm.  The only thing i didn' like was that he doesn' use canvas at all. so you dont know what your grade is unless you constantly check with him through his handwritten book he uses. Study guides are given, pretty fair, pay attention during lecture and you'll pass."
2736,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,2.0,I was honestly scared for political science because of essays upon essays BUT thankfully he only has one and it is required to get an A and that's a book report. The rest of your grade is 6 quizzes that he gives you a study guide for. Be sure to study because the quizzes are not multiple choice! He also gives plenty of extra credit opportunities.
2737,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,3.0,"Professor Peplowski is so intelligent that you have to know what you're talking about before you decide to say anything  or else he'll make you look dumb haha. I was too intimidated to ever say anything. He has 4 ""quizzes"". Every quiz is fill in the blank, definitions and T/F. I didn't get an A because I didn't do the book report."
2738,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POLYSCI101,5.0,2.0,"Easy class. I did not receive an A on any of the five tests, besides the sixth take home one, and I will be taking a B. I could have gotten an A if I had done the book report. Do the book report. Also, participate in class because you can learn a lot from the old man!"
2739,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC252,4.0,3.0,Very informative and knowledgeable
2740,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,3.0,"Honestly, one of the most intelligent humans on this Earth! I wish I took this class more seriously because he is an amazing teacher and will teach you so much within the semester. Only tests,  a group project, and a book report if you want an A+. Attendance is not mandatory however, I did find myself struggling on quizzes when I missed too much."
2741,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,2.0,"If you have no sense of humor, don't take this professor. Peplowski, is a intellectual person in his field. Lectures are heavy! make sure to take notes (recommended to take laptop) easy worksheets and quizzes if you study. 6 quizzes, a lot of extra credit, and a book report due with easy rubric grading for an easy A in class. No time for laziness."
2742,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POLYSCI101,4.0,3.0,"he does all the talking, allow you to retake exam if you miss. He is very clear on expectations for the class. is a great prof. Wish i can have him for more classes."
2743,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC295,4.0,3.0,"I've taken multiple classes with Mr. Peplowski and one thing is for sure, he cares about his students. Stay up-to-date on current events, get in the conversations, ask questions, read and you will do just fine! This is true about most of his classes. He is an easy grader as long as you show real effort. If you ned help or extra credit- ASK!"
2744,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POL101,3.5,3.0,"This is a good class not an easy A but definitely a good experience. The class is pretty simple 5 tests 1 take home and a book report(needed to get an A.) He provides study guides so reading the book is not really necessary since it conflicts with what he has on the guides at times. Come to class everyday and stay, review the guide and do all EC."
2745,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,2.5,1.0,"There are four tests that are very easy, he gives study guides. I am not a fan of politics so the lectures are long and boring. He does crack a few jokes here and there. He is not bias,so you will be able to make your own opinions. Attendance isn't mandatory but you should be there because he announces tests only in class."
2746,342510,Mark,Peplowski,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.5,2.0,Peplowski knows his stuff!  He's got tons of experience in his field.  He gets lots of his students involved in local politics.  He's the best!!
2748,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,1.0,"Took this class online due to quarantine, though I dread online classes. This was a really easy one, We got about 5 assignments, and 5 Exams, lowest exam dropped (I Think). And really everything was super easy and spaced out, I probably only had to log into canvas and complete an assignment and exam ONCE EVERY WEEK, which I couldn't ask for better"
2749,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,2.0,"Really nice professor, will help you any way he can if you reach out to him. His online class was super chill and easy. 1 assignment and 1 test per unit and they are not difficult at all if you read his notes and powerpoints."
2750,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,4.0,Great professor! Some of these comments are harsh. I don't understand why! This class is difficult but if you study and give your time then you will do great in the class. The assignments are clear and easy. He's an easy grader and always gives good feedback. He replies to your emails fairly quickly! I definitely recommend it taking it online!!
2751,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,"Really great, easygoing teacher! Gives consistent feedback and puts in grades in a timely manner. To do well on the exam you have to review his notes and go through the textbook, but its nothing too complicated! He has a fair amount of assignments and exams, for you to receive a fair grade. Would recommend."
2752,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,2.0,Super easy SOC class to pass with Professor Gannon. Gives really great positive feedback on assignments. Only four assignments and four exams and you have two chances on exams and you get one drop exam. Take this professor if you need the SOC credit. Assignments are actually really interesting and will get you thinking.
2753,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,I took this teacher a few semesters ago and hes actually the first teacher that truly made me feel welcomed at CSN. Hes relate-able and extremely kind. He really wants you to learn and he has a good way of explaining during lectures. I did all the work and it wasn't hard to get an A if you literally just try.
2754,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,3.0,4.0,"Great person, but it was a hard class to get into because all you did was read the textbook and his notes that he makes. Those are most helpful for the test. I recommend printing them out and making notes on them. All I did was read for the whole semester it felt like.. He has cool writing assignments that are easy and he DOES read them."
2755,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Gannon is amazing! I took the class online. Only 4 units, one exam and one assignment for each unit. The course is kind of heavy on reading but lets be real what college class isn't. Also, he is very fair at grading and provides specific feedback for every assignment submitted. Highly recommend taking his online course!"
2756,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,"I took his online course during the summer. It consisted of 4 exams (+a final) and 4 written assignments. The written assignments were easy because it was mostly opinion based. You have to read a lot for this class. However, I would focus on the notes he provides on each chapter. They are very helpful for his exams. He is a great professor!"
2757,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,3.0,Took this class online and was perfect. Professor always reminds you about your next test or exam. And hes always giving you good feedbacks! 100% recommended
2758,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,5.0,The hardest class ever. The class has four exams which are very hard even though you study hard. However the teacher is very helpful and supportive and each exam has two tries which still doesn't help to do well. I spend most of my time for this class and I had a very little time left for other classes. I would not choose this professor again.
2759,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOCIOLOGY101,5.0,1.0,This class was fairly easy. You have to read and understand the chapters or you will not do well on his tests. The nice thing is you get multiple chances to take the exams. There are 4 exams and a final and 4 assignments. The assignments are fairly easy. Most are about your own opinion. I would take him again. I actually enjoyed this class.
2760,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,2.0,4.0,For this class there is one homework assignment and one test per month. The assignments are easy but have nothing to do with the test. Your are able to take the test twice which is nice but at the end of each test the answers you have gotten wrong are not given. He responds quickly if you have questions but I would personally not take him again.
2761,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,"I took this class online with Prof. Gannon. Although, it was online, Professor was always accessible via e-mail or by appointment. Professor Gannon was very reasonable when it came to the amount of time allowed to complete and turn in assignments and finish exams. I can tell he's laid-back but &amp; cares that his students succeed."
2762,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOCIOLOGY101,5.0,2.0,First teacher i've had with a good sense of humor. If you do the work there's no reason not to pass. You'll be lucky to get him as a teacher.
2763,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gannon is Great! He is clear on what is required for the class, gives good feedback, and posts reminders about deadlines. Read the book and take notes, the notes he provides are really helpful too. There are 4 written assignments and 4 exams. Definitely recommend taking his class."
2764,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,1.0,"This class was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken.  The great thing is that even though it was easy, I found the material to be very worthwhile and found the class to be quite enjoyable. Professor Gannon was very clear  on what was needed for class, and  and always responded quickly to email inquiries. I highly recommend this professor."
2765,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,2.0,"Passionate about teaching. Read book and take good notes in book. Tests were difficult because it was online. Open notes, but questions from book."
2766,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,3.0,He allowed us two chances to take each exam. Make sure to read each chapter and take notes. The notes that he provides was really helpful.
2767,632891,John,Gannon,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,2.0,Super chill class just do the work. Took this class online I wish all of my classes was this lax.  4 written assignments and 4 test. Do well on the four test and skip the final.
2769,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL101,5.0,2.0,amazing professor with grading based off of 10 quizzes. Munteanu made philosophy easy to understand and easy to read. I personally didn't read the textbook and only used it for the exercises/hw bc he provided written notes and lectures that were easier to follow and he REALLY broke down the chapters. 1000/10 please take their class!!!
2770,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,4.0,1.0,This class was the easiest class I've ever taken. I took it for summer and all you had to do was take 10 tests. Don't waste your time buying the textbook you don't need it. You get 4 times to pass the test and you can see what answers you got wrong so process of elimination and most the questions only have 2 options. Such an easy grade.
2771,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,1.0,"The professor is passionate about what he teaches. There are 10 quizzes. There is a lecture, but the professor does post the lecture notes and will have a guide to following along. There is a lot of reading but the tests are easy. I highly recommend taking Professor Munteanu!"
2772,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL101,5.0,2.0,This professor is amazing. His lectures are interesting and you can tell he is very passionate about Philosophy. He seems like he really cares about his students and making sure we have everything we need to get a good grade in his class. I really enjoyed this class and would definitely it again.
2773,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,1.0,Most caring professor I have ever had. Easiest class too!
2774,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL101,5.0,1.0,"This was by far the easiest class ever at CSN. His lectures are pretty motivating and he has a good sense of humor, you can tell he has a passion for philosophy. Didn't use the book so don't buy it because he gives you all the notes on Canvas. Tests were extremely easy just use his study guide. Take this class for an easy A!!"
2775,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL101,5.0,2.0,"He is THE BEST. Graded by tests only but they are so so easy, he even makes chapter outlines for you. Each test is open for like 5 days AND they are only 20 questions. I highly recommend this professor."
2776,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,3.0,"Great instructor. It really shows that he cares and wants everyone to do well. Textbook wasn't really needed since he prepared a lot of notes already for use. Only 2 tests a month, 20 questions each. Definitely would take him again!"
2777,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL101,5.0,1.0,"He is one of the best professors I have had by far. Loved going to his classes, because he can be so inspirational and moving. He tries to go at the same pace as students, not too fast not too slow, and always want to make sure everybody is on the same page. Great professor, and great human being. All of the quizzes are online with study guides."
2778,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,This class is one of the easiest class that I took in my college career He is very respectful I passed my course with a good grade.
2779,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"If you get anything less than a perfect score in this class, you have no business being in college. 10 tests. The professor tells you not only which questions are on the test, but you've already been given the answer key to the questions the week before. If that isn't enough, you have 3 attempts to take each test, and the questions do not change."
2780,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,4.0,2.0,"This class was way easier than expected. He gives you PLENTY of time to read each chapter, but pay attention to which chapters are next as he sometimes doesn't go in order. (I've definitely read the wrong chapters before.) USE HIS NOTES! The key to an A is to read the chapter and utilize his notes before taking the quizzes."
2781,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"Super easy class. Easy A, only 10 tests. two every two weeks. Everything is on quizlet. Don't buy the textbook. It's not necessary."
2782,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,All you have to do is take 10 quizzes online and there super easy. You get three attempts for each quiz and the quizzes are the same each attempt so you can go back and see what you got wrong. He emails you every time there is quiz to remind you. He's a great professor and an easy A take him I promise you you wont regret it! GPA booster!
2783,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI102,5.0,1.0,"Okay so there is two tests every month but they are so easy you don't even need to study for them. Easiest A ever. I took the course online and we had no homework, just the tests. The tests are open book and open note and the questions come right from the text book. TAKE THIS CLASS."
2784,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,1.0,"Professor Munteanu wants you to succeed. He provides all the tools that you need in order to get an A in this course. Read all his announcements on canvas and especially the study guides. Very passionate about what he lectures. No essays, all test formats based off his lectures which everything is provided in Canvas."
2785,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,2.0,"This class was great, the set up really made it easy to predict and manage with a full load of other classes. This class plays well with others. The study guides she creates are extremely helpful, as are the exercises she has us do the week before test week. Thankfully no essays, all tests. Learned a lot in this class!"
2786,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,2.0,"I took Prof. Munteanus PHIL 102 course online and it went a lot better than I expected! PHIL is a tough subject but he breaks it down easily for you! Hes very passionate and it shows through his funny and well thought-out written lectures! Just 10, 20-question tests and a final. Very easy stuff. Definitely recommended for non-PHIL/ENG majors!"
2787,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,3.0,1.0,"His class is easy... Study and take two tests every two weeks. Its not that enjoyable though, its a forgettable class. There are better philosophy profs. If you are looking for an easy A take the class, if you are looking to enjoy philosophy the way it should be taught, take another prof. (His notes/lectures can also be very confusing at times)"
2788,887931,Vasile,Munteanu,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL102,5.0,1.0,"Trust me when I tell you to take this professor's class online! Easy A. The work is evenly distributed and he is veeery helpful with assignments. If you know the answers to the assignments, you will pass every test. All tests taken online. Textbook is required."
2790,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,3.0,3.0,Professor Mirjanian isnt a bad professor. Its just his online class is very lecture heavy! One hour lectures you have to watch and take notes on because his exams are ONLY based on his lectures. Small details matter but other than that the class was okay.
2791,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC200,5.0,4.0,"I swear, this class is easier than it seems. What he expects of you is clear and concise (the questions he gives you for each piece? Study the answers and you'll ace his exams), and his lecture style is also very clean. Engaging questions about the literature. Overall, really enjoyed the class."
2792,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,POLISCI101,3.0,4.0,"I don't like poli sci, so I was stressed at the beginning w/all the work, but then as the weeks went by it seemed better. As long as you give a good brief explanation/opinion on the HW then you'll get full credit. The only thing that brought my grade down was the final exam 1hr/50ques, make sure you understand what you read in the book for that"
2793,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PS101,5.0,2.0,"Took him for online. He is very organized on what assignments are due. They are all posted on canvas on the first day. Only focuses on one textbook (Bower's) and lectures are videos. Listen to the lectures , read the sections, answer the weekly discussions as best as possible and you will be fine. Grades easy too. Only one exam (final)."
2794,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,3.0,3.0,"Dr. M was a great professor, I dont perform well on test and his class is TEST graded, your participation weekly is 25% of the overall grade but the exams are 75%. His exams are 50 questions 40 are multiple choice worth 1 pt and 10 are short answers worth 10pts. Do those first and dont pay attention to the ""short"" part, give detail."
2795,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,4.0,"Even though I took mine online, you have to study heavy for the test. Use key concepts as a study guide to each unit. There are 3 units and 3 test which make up most of your grade. If you think you can cheat, you can't. Test are based off his lectures not stuff you can look up. If PSC is a hard subject for you, I recommend looking elsewhere."
2796,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC200,5.0,4.0,I absolutely loved this class! There was a lot to read and the content was challenging but this professor was amazing! He is extremely passionate about the subject and works hard to engage the whole class in discussion especially with harder to grasp concepts. The floor is always open for questions and he does his best to make sure you understand!!
2797,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,3.0,"There are weekly assignments and 3 exams. The exam has 50 multiple choice questions and 5 essays. The essays are made of the same questions from each lecture video, so you can finish the essays if you answer them ahead of time. I got the textbook, but I didn't use it since the lectures answered everything. You need to put effort, but good class!"
2798,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Don Mirjanian is the best professor I have ever taken. He is really passionate about what he teaches and is a good teacher. Textbook isnt completely necessary, but should get it because it helps, and sometimes he asks question about the reading. ( in discussion form). The grades for his class are made up of 2 papers, 2 midterms and final"
2799,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PCS101,5.0,4.0,"6-week summer course, last class before nursing program. 1st impression: ""Wow, this is intense for a 101 class."" Enjoyed his lectures tho. Got 10/10 on every assignment--just answer all parts of prompt. Three exams: 50 mult. ch. Qs + 5 essays, which are 75% of grade. Open note, open book at home. Rarely needed book but some Qs from it, so get it."
2800,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC200,1.0,3.0,"I've been an ""A""/high ""B"" student my entire academic career &amp; have experienced dozens of educators. I wrote 2 pro-American papers in his course- one received a mediocre grade &amp; I was accused of recycling my second from another class. He refused to provide any evidence supporting his claim and my attempt at dialogue with him was pointless. Shameful."
2801,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,4.0,"I recommend watching the lectures and following along by answering the 10 questions that he gives for each week; some of these questions are the same as the free responses on the exam. I was able to get an A on 2/3 of the exams just by watching the lectures and taking notes but the book does help too, just skim the info. weekly discussions also"
2802,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PCS101,3.0,4.0,"Hes a good Prof, although he is very specific when he comes to asking questions. Hes does NOT accept late work and is lecture heavy. Get ready to sit in front of the computer for 1 - 2 hours. Class is quite boring and not creative."
2803,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC231,5.0,3.0,"You will definitely need to read the textbook, watch the lectures, and participate weekly to get a good grade. His lectures are very enlightening, and I loved them. He sometimes also assigns other things to read or watch, but they all pertain to what you're learning. He isn't a tough grader but as long as you do the work you should get a good grade"
2804,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PCS101,3.0,5.0,"He knows his stuff, he's unbiased, but his grading criteria is tough. 75% of your grade is based on exams and not doing well on one test could easily hurt your grade. The 2 hours given for the exams really isn't enough, even if you have accommodations for extra time from the resource center."
2805,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC200,5.0,3.0,"This class changed my life and my outlook on government and society. I had no idea I could understand so much about philosophy - its like he brought Plato and Aristotle right into to the classroom with us. He's hot and brilliant and an amazing teacher. Take him, take him now."
2806,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC211,4.0,4.0,"Professor uses a lot of discussion posts and his tests are extremely lengthy. Otherwise is pretty straight forward with what he expects. If you want a class you can coast through, I'd look elsewhere, but if you are going to actually put in the work required, you should have no trouble with this class."
2807,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC211,5.0,4.0,"As someone who has always loved anything involving international relations, I took Intro. to Comparative Politics to determine if I want to major in International Studies once I complete my associate's degree. With that being said, this class requires a lot of reading &amp; the ability to think outside the box; 10/10, would recommend this class."
2808,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PS101,5.0,3.0,"Very knowledgeable professor, loves his subject. He tries to be funny and unbiased on political positions, although lectures fast-I had only half of the notes. Three exams, two papers (grades generously). The course book was thrilling but time-consuming, so I studied from his lecture notes. Definitely would show you a bigger prospective. Easy.. B?"
2809,1172833,Don,Mirjanian,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Political Science,PSC101,4.0,4.0,"Personally, I am not a political science person but I enjoyed coming to his classes even if they were 3 hours long. Super funny &amp; definitely knows his stuff and provides amazing slides with corresponding lecture notes and study questions. Very approachable and willing to help on the essays or understand anything outside of class."
2811,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,5.0,3.0,Professor Numrich was an incredible teacher. His teaching style is laid back but I learned so much from his class. It is a fast pace class so if you can keep up with the homework you will do fine (I took the 8-week version). He responds in a timely manner and is always extremely helpful if you are confused. I would take a class from him again.
2812,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,5.0,3.0,This teacher is so amazing! He puts time and effort into his class and you SHOULD WANT to do the same for him. Seriously professors caring about your grades and if your actually learning is unheard of!!! TAKE HIM! he is amazing yes its a lot of homework but do the work and it is A BREEZE! Love ya Professor Numrich P.S. ur cat is super cute
2813,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,4.0,3.0,This class was an 8-week online class and it was mostly based on the homework done through Sapling. He makes discussions on canvas so that the class is able to interact a bit. The class is very structured and if you do well on the exams you'll be fine. He puts in a lot of effort to help his students. He is always willing to help.
2814,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON102,5.0,4.0,"This class is not going to be an easy one, so get ready to turn your thinking caps on. Be prepared to READ and put in all your effort. Professor Numrich makes his syllabus very clear so if you have any questions on how the class will work on an online setting, the answers are all there."
2815,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,4.0,2.0,"Took his class over the summer and his class is a must for those who work 9 to 5p jobs. Homeworks are a lot, but super manageable. There are 4 online (open book) exams and a proctored (CSN Testing Center) that you must pass with at least a D to pass the class. He will tell you the exact topic of what those essay based questions are, so don't fret!"
2816,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,4.0,3.0,"Prof Numrich or ""Rich"" is very passionate about teaching and economics. He takes the time in class to explain the concepts needed to understand the material and to be able to pass the course. He will always let you know if he is putting something on a test or on the final exam. He always replies to emails and stays after class to help a student."
2817,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON102,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Numrich is pretty good, if youre into economics he always sends out informative things in emails to connect everything to the real world. Hes very test heavy. The final is very easy though and Im very thankful for that; he also gave me an extra chance when I forgot to do an exam even though I didnt deserve it, again thankful."
2818,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,5.0,3.0,"He was a great professor, I took his 8-week online course along with other class and the amount of homework was nothing too drastic. If I needed help understanding the material I would go to his office and he was helpful. Final is in person and based off of material from the course so nothing is new material."
2819,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,4.0,4.0,This class is not easy by any means but I personally loved taking this class with him because even though the material was hard he always gave me grace. I missed an exam and he e-mailed ME the next day giving me an extension. That's unheard of! I got a failing grade on my final and he still curved and gave me an A. Nothing gets better than that!
2820,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,2.0,5.0,"One tough course. 8wk hybrid, long lectures (3 hours), lots of online homework with due dates 2 days apart. Makes you watch tegrity videos which are of him just repeating what was in class. 4 exams and a final. Final is not MC and is different in format than all the other tests. Definitely a ""teach yourself"" course as he isn't keen on helping."
2821,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,2.0,5.0,"Probably the hardest class I have taken. Very lecture heavy with lectures lasting 3 hours, he makes you watch tegrity videos which are 1 hour vids that are basically what you learned in class. 4 exams and a final with the final being totally different than the other exams. He stutters a lot and isn't helpful. You must pass final to pass the class"
2822,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,5.0,3.0,Prof Numrich understands that math is not everyone's strength. He grades based not on your algebra skills but your understanding of the statistics concepts. He makes these very boring and abstract concepts easy to understand and relatable with (very nerdy) jokes and anecdotes.
2823,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,1.0,3.0,"HWs and Videos is time consuming. It gives out tasks that take half of the day to finish. He require you to watch video he filmed and most of them are an hour. There is no meaning taking this class online because you would end up stuck at home with his homework, quiz, and video. People who have job and other courses, this class is not for you"
2824,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,1.0,4.0,"Not scientific at all! Confusing long lectures. He repeats the mandatory videos during his lectures. Don't waste your time going to class. Get a tutor and do the work yourself. He won't help, won't answer questions, and he's very bias. If he likes you he'll help. If not you're in trouble. Tries to be funny but it's uncomfortable to listen!"
2825,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON102,3.0,4.0,"Gives many materials for studying outside of just textbook reading such as discussion posts, or short clips that relate to economics. There are also required videos that need to be viewed in a timely matter. Videos are in need of revision, being recorded in 2011 according to his computer screen. Many typos throughout material making it confusing"
2826,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,4.0,4.0,"Statistics is HARD. It's just an intense math-heavy class. No professor on earth can make complicated stat concepts into 2+24. That said, Numrich is the BEST possible choice of teachers at CSN. He gives you more than enough resources to learn from &amp; the homework is purely to help YOU. Go to every class, watch his videos(for online), &amp; you CAN pass"
2827,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,1.0,4.0,"Terrible teacher! Condescending, unpleasant, confusing and not helpful at all. Let's students come in and out of class during finals!! Teaches what not to do first, does not provide well needed real life examples, or step by step explanations. I learned more fromm my Finite Mathematics class with Duke about statistics then with this guy."
2828,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,4.0,4.0,"8 week online course. Chapter readings/homework/quizzes usually due 2 days apart, but you do have more time over the weekends. WORK AHEAD! You have to keep up with the workload or you'll be lost. He posts lecture videos that range from 30 min to over 1 hour long. Must pass in-person final exam to pass the course. Very time consuming class."
2829,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,4.0,3.0,"Participation in the discussion posts matters to him. He's really passionate about his classes and usually his posts will be jokes related to the content in class. Even though there is a lot of homework, he is very helpful and gives good feedback. Always available and replies quickly."
2830,384191,Richard,Numrich,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Economics,ECON261,5.0,3.0,"Professor Numrich designs the class so you must understand the material to pass, and to assist he uses videos he personally makes and interesting discussions to help refine the lesson plan. He responds very quickly to questions and does everything in his power to help his students learn. The perfect professor if you want to master the material."
2832,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,2.0,5.0,took this online because my history credit had expired from my AP days. If I didnt have that knowledge base of American history this class would be overwhelming. If shes going to give this insane amount of reading for her class she could least post a lecture once a week to explain. Do NOT take her class. Just wait a semester for another teacher.
2833,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,WMST101,2.0,2.0,"Her class is an easy A but get ready for a discussion post every week and then a 5 page essay every month. I can honestly say I did not learn anything in this class, most of the articles she makes you read are repetitive and she grades super harshly on EXACT word or sentence count. Super boring class."
2834,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HISTORY101,1.0,5.0,"If you are looking for your sign on whether to take this class or not, this is your sign, DO NOT DO IT. She does not care about content, she limits your creativity, and finds whatever she can wrong with your assignments. She is one of those ""No one gets an A in my class"" type teachers. Pride yourself on teaching students, NOT on failing them."
2835,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,4.0,I took a 4 week summer class and HATED it. Please take ANY other teacher. Had to purchase 2 books for the class which I needed the first week; it became an issue getting the book. one big paper is due within 1 week. 3 big papers and her discussions.. bookwork.... the worst thing I have ever done. Discussions limited and deducted for little reason.
2836,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,1.0,This is HIST 101. Imagine students coming right out of high school taking this class. This was taught like an upper division course with upper division expectations. You're teaching at the wrong institution.
2837,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,WMST255,2.0,5.0,Beachley is a very difficult professor! She expects too much out of her students and her grading criteria is insane. This felt more like and English class with the way she grades. Please choose someone else. The topic was interesting but Beachley really makes you regret choosing the class. There are much better history professors out there. Avoid!
2838,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101102,5.0,4.0,"If you're looking for a instructor that requires you use your own brain (what a concept), write coherently (a college student should be able to do that), and follow instructions to complete assignments (sounds like a life skill to me), then this instructor is for you! Dr. Beachley has high standards and grades are earned, just the way it should be!"
2839,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,She is a very VERY tough grader. If you take her class make sure that you follow every. single. instruction. I thought that I had followed every single instruction but apparently not because I got a bad grade on everything I did. I usually get good grades. This is the first C I have ever gotten. I would not recommend this professor.
2840,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,5.0,"Never in my college life have I been insulted ! I never missed any assignments, always did what her instructions said and she still managed to grade me very low. Im disappointed. She grades extremely tough and requires a lot of reading &amp; writing. Her comments are tough to even read. She literally made me want to rip my hair off my scalp. BEWARE."
2841,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,5.0,3.0,"I can't believe some of the comments. First, Dr. Beachley does a great job of giving you history--what happened and how to think about it. If you don't pick up on it, maybe it's YOUR problem. Don't like getting points deducted? Try following directions like adults are supposed to be able to do. Think she gives too much work? Welcome to college."
2842,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,5.0,"This is a level 100 class and the instructor graded as if it was a much higher level class.  There was more emphasis on grammar and word count than on the subject of History.  She was very slow to grade our assignments, the next assignment was due before the first was graded.  I have a 3.6 GPA and I have struggled to maintain a C. NEVER AGAIN!"
2843,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,4.0,Never again. Taken accelerated courses before but this one was the worst.
2844,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,2.0,5.0,"Expect to read. Quizzes, essays and 2 page paper due weekly. Tough grader"
2845,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST121,2.0,5.0,Grades students as if they had a PhD
2846,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,5.0,"I've never taken a class with such a nit-picky grader. I've gotten 15-25 points taken off of every single essay and discussion post, why? Because I do crazy things like use contractions and the second person. Her feedback is never on the actual substance of what you turned in. DO NOT take a class with her if you're worried about your GPA"
2847,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,"In her online now; Prepared to work hard for a 4 wk online class; 3 essays, 2 discussion posts 23-25 sentences each w/ 10-12 sentence comments on other students; 3 ""worksheets"" (essays pretty much) 23-25sentences; DOES NOT give feedback when asked; answers to quizzes blocked; HARDEST GRADER IVE EVER HAD &amp; on nonsense (not even history)!"
2848,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,4.0,"Assignment instructions confusing and she'll always find something wrong with what you turn in no matter how careful you are. She takes most points off for grammar and contradicts the textbook when giving feedback. 10 plus hours of reading a day to stay ahead for the 4 week course. Learned SO much from the textbooks, nothing from the professor."
2849,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,WMST255,3.0,4.0,"This is a difficult class, but my favorite. Make sure you read the material, and follow directions to the letter. Dr. Beachley is a difficult grader. She's also always willing to help and responds quickly to emails. This class had 3 books, but normal books, not textbooks. (all 3 about $20) One criticism I have is she takes forever to enter grades."
2850,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,2.0,5.0,"16 quizzes, 4 discussions and 4 papers. 2 Text books. You must read the whole textbook and other extra assignments. You can spend the whole day writing a good discussion and this teacher will mark points off anyway without explaining why. She will find something wrong with your paper no matter what! and assign a low grade. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!"
2851,387422,Deanna,Beachley,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,101,2.0,4.0,"Her feedback on her weekly writings are more like she's  trying to select material to write her own history book.  You can write the best paper , have it checked by a writing professor and she'll find something wrong with it.  Unless your looking to become a professor of history yourself, she needs to go!!  Has 1 person obtain ed an  A??????"
2853,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,"A true Gem! I took her 8 week course, we had 3 total speeches, an outline is due a week before the speech. She gives you a very good example, to use for the outlines. A short 3 min video about yourself, 1 short exam, and peer evaluation essay. Honestly one of the best, most helpful yet easiest classes i've taken. She's there to help!"
2854,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,"I took mandel for the 8 week accelerated class and she was amazing. You do 4 speeches but she is more then happy to read over your outlines before turning them in. Gives great feedback, super funny, and easy to contact outside of class if you have questions. Highly recommend her if you are new and easily nervous with crowds."
2855,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,"I was dreading communications more than any other class but Jodie made it a wonderful experience! I felt very comfortable and respected. I took her eight week course and as long as you attend all classes, because you fail if you miss too many, and follow her specific formats then you'll be good."
2856,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,She is well balanced and helpful to her students. Her class was simple and taught me quite a bit. She focuses on how how to deliver your speeches and your outlines following the correct format. She builds a great environment in her class that it makes me want to take her class again. This class taught me a ton.
2857,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM215,5.0,3.0,"The key to pass with this professor is organization skills, work ethic and engagement. Put in the work, try your best and you will pass."
2858,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,4.0,I took Professor Mandel's COM 101 class and I definitely recommend her. There's a total of 3 speeches (along with small speeches about introducing yourself). She requires an outline and FORMAT matters! She will provide useful tips for presentations. The classroom's environment is very friendly and that is very important to a speech class.
2859,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Jodie was amazing. I think we all get anxiety when it comes to COM 101 but she is able to talk about ways to lower your anxiety (more towards meditation and breathing techniques). I took her 8 week course and it was fun. I truly recommend taking her class, she is such a great professor."
2860,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,Professor Jodie did an absolutely amazing job teaching and being one with the class and making sure that you understood what was being taught to you. She made this class so much fun and light-hearted making it my favorite class of the semester. I would 100% take her class again especially if she had a higher one. Cheers :)
2861,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,4.0,3.0,"Took the hybrid 8 week course. Had 4 speeches, 1 online and 3 in class. 1 exam that we used the book for. She is very big on attendance. She give you a very specific outline to follow. If you follow that outline when writing and delivering the speech you will get a good grade. Easy grader. Does mediation before speech day. Very cool teacher."
2862,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,Professor Mendel is an amazing person and one of the best professors I have ever had. She is so Encouraging and will help you every way she can to Succeed in this class. I was very scared to take this class because Im not from this country and I was not very confident in myself but she helped me get over my fears &amp; build my Confidence. thank you
2863,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,1.0,"Amazing teacher, she helped a lot and was very caring. She would go through yoga stretches and exercise before speeches and it was the best thing. I would recommend her for everyone trying to take COM101 and who is afraid of speaking"
2864,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Jodie is the best, I took this class for two months. Im not American and I did not finish high school here but this instructor is so helpful and responsible when you asked her she answers you very quickly. I did two videos at my home and two presentations at the campus with some students too and I met her she is so sweet."
2865,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,"Before this class I didn't know how to speak publicly but Professor Jodie changed that! she is caring , funny, and understanding."
2866,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,4.0,"Professor Jodie was great! I was extremely scared to take COM, but she made the process as easy as possible. There was only 1 test in the entire class. Shes extremely funny, and understanding. I definitely would recommend her to anyone who is scared of public speaking. As far as text books go, you really dont need one for this class."
2867,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM215,5.0,1.0,"Took online over summer. Super easy and fun. Prof Mandel is super nice and responds quickly. Do the work and easy A. I had one paper, one video speech presentation, and a few online quizzes. Also I did this class with 2 other classes! Def recommend!"
2868,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,She's easy going and class is fun. Attendance matters. 10/10 would recommend
2869,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Jodie was probably one of my favorite teachers. She is clear on everything she wants and how it should be done. Attendance is required. There are four speeches, one submitted online. She gives great feedback and really wants her students to succeed. Extremely caring and also does meditation in classes. Would 1000% take again."
2870,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,"I usually dont rate my professors, but I had to rate Professor Jodie because she is amazing! If you have anxiety, she helps reduce that by making the class feel like a family. Assignments are very clear, 1 speech You turn in online, 3 you deliver in class, and some discussions. This is an easy A class! Attendance is mandatory!"
2871,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,3.0,Best professor during my college career! Great lectures and she always gives honest feedback. She is open anytime for any of your class needs!
2872,954072,Jodie,Mandel,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Communication,COM101,5.0,2.0,"She is so outgoing and relieves some of anxiety to public speaking, she's the best!"
2874,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO196,5.0,4.0,"Professor Rhett is the first professor I have had that has taken the time to connect with students. His class has been the hardest class I have taken to date but it only taught me how to be a better student. If you put the effort, this class is beyond worth it. (he uses an clicker for quiz pts &amp; the tests are lecture based) Totally recommend him!"
2875,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,5.0,4.0,"This is not an easy class. The material itself is complicated. Record his lectures, then write down every single thing he says on the slide print outs at the end of the week. Then re-read the lecture notes until it makes sense. It is very time consuming to do this, but well worth it as my grade reflected the time spent learning the material."
2876,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,5.0,4.0,"Professor Rhett is the best professor that I've had for 224. His lectures are fun and it is mandatory to show up to every class and not be late because you do have to use iclickers for quiz questions. Some of the quiz questions are easy, but you are able to use your notes or your neighbor. Study every day and listen to lectures multiple times!"
2877,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL196,4.0,4.0,"Michelson is a great and funny professor. He drops the lowest test and quiz grade you receive in labs and lecture. Make sure when you study, to go in dept and understand the material and not just surface. He phrases his questions on tests a little weird to throw you off but just read through it. Make sure to ask questions and attend class!"
2878,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,4.0,4.0,"I passed BIO 224 with Dr. Rhett. He makes all the things we have to learn easier to understand, but do not think you don't have to work for it! His tests were straightforward, which was much appreciated. Come with your iClicker and recorder! He gives extra points every class and it helped me learn and boosted my grades a *tiny* bit!"
2879,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL196,4.0,4.0,"Rhett is an amazing professor, a bit intimidating at first but very quickly turns into a ""dad"" figure with all the dad jokes and stories he tells. Attendance is kinda necessary to get iClicker points, which count as quizzes. He drops the lowest test score as well. Overall an excellent proff with very good lecturing skills makes tests hard tho."
2880,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL189,5.0,4.0,"His style of teaching is the best I've ever encountered. Drops lowest exam/quiz. Show up to every class and do iclickers for easy points that counts towards all your quizzes. Record each lecture and use it to study for exams. I didn't really use the textbook, its good to have tho. Best professor. Hope to take 224 with him in the future. Lets hope."
2881,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,4.0,4.0,"Attendance is required to get iClicker scores. Book isn't needed, but you do need the Mastering for HW assignments. Beware, he doesn't always use the same verbiage in his exams as he does in his lectures. Rec taking Bio095 beforehand, he does move fast. Does not hand back exams for feedback, only for review during office hours. No reviews b4 exam."
2882,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO189,5.0,4.0,"Some of the material is difficult to understand reading the textbook, but this professor is very helpful in grasping the important topics and ideas in each chapter. He definitely helps in understanding the material, and helps keep you focused and refreshed using humor throughout the lecture."
2883,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,5.0,3.0,"He doesn't teach 224 often, but when he does, take him! His powerpoints and lectures are some of the best I've had and he focuses on important stuff, and doesn't make you study every little detail. His exams are very straight forward no trick questions. Just a great person overall, he's really nice and approachable, a very funny guy! Great class."
2884,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL196,5.0,3.0,"Really interesting class! His lectures were clear and thorough. He dropped the lowest exam and quiz, so he gave you some leeway. DONT SKIP CLASS! There is quiz questions every day and you can't make it up. As long as you study and pay attention, you should be fine. Was really good on answering questions. There's a code you need for the online hw."
2885,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO196,5.0,4.0,"Rhett is a great teacher and scientist--he's funny, easy to ask for help, and cares about his students' success. The lecture does move VERY quickly at times, be forewarned! This course requires a lot of your time regardless of who the teacher is, but if you make the effort to study the concepts you will do well. Highly recommend this professor!"
2886,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,5.0,3.0,"Take Rhett, he is an amazing professor ! I would also advice you not to buy the book because I did not use it at all."
2887,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL196LAB,5.0,4.0,I LOVE RHETT! Take him! He is an awesome lab teacher--super chill and straightforward about his grading criteria for the Biology 196 Lab paper. I have heard that his lecture is very hard so beware of that but he is very knowledgeable and into detail about biology. He cares about his students and is also realistic about medical school advice.
2888,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO224,5.0,4.0,"This class is really hard, so no matter who you take you will work your butt off for a good grade.  This was my second time taking it, and he was really good.  I still couldn't get an A, but thats just cause I didnt have enough time to study.  It takes a lot!"
2889,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO196,5.0,5.0,"Very awesome teacher you can't find a better Bio196 teacher he cares about his students, and he teaches in a way where retaining information is easy. He has a sense of humor. He is very professional to his students. He is great for lab too. Ask questions he likes talking to students. Study hard and take him. Cons exam answer choices are perplexing."
2890,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL196,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class, found myself including a lot of the things I had learned in my daily conversations. Its hard because Biology is hard; however Professor Michelson made it easy for us to understand with lots of good analogies and some occasional comedy. Hes  super helpful, and always kept us engaged. I'm sad he doesn't teach other BIOL classes."
2891,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIOL196,2.5,4.0,Easy going teacher.  The lectures are long and he goes over the information pretty quickly.  To get a better understanding of the information you should read the textbook and look over the notes before the test.  The only thing I didn't like was the daily iClickers so attendance is mandatory if you want to get the points
2892,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO196,3.5,4.0,"He is without a doubt a great teacher. His lectures are super fun. But the way he grades the class, makes it difficult. Tests are super tough, He will basically tell you to study 3 or 4 chapters for an exam. No study guides, no guidelines of what the exam will actually cover.  I wouldn't take another class with him, and i got a B+ as a grade."
2893,819071,Rhett,Michelson,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Biology,BIO196,4.5,4.0,"At the beginning of the semester I would never have thought I could get a B.  His tests really require a more understanding than just sitting in the class.  You have to study outside of class too.  Very nice, easy going professor.  Good for lab too."
2895,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST100,1.0,4.0,"Extremely subjective grader. The discussion questions made me feel I was in theater class. Very hypocritical on grammar. I located several grammatical errors in the syllabus and the modules, but this teacher will knock you for minor grammar errors. Feedback was not accurate either. This teacher would serve the world better as a thespian coach."
2896,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,4.0,"She is INCREDIBLY tough in her grading. Despite putting forth your best effort it's still most likely you will not get a perfect score on ANYTHING. If you haven't done every little bit of research on a person she assigns and answer with ALL the researched info, you'll most likely get a C at best. Choose a different professor and save yourself."
2897,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,4.0,She is very harsh in her grading. Even if you do the work she will give you low scoring. Just can't get it right with her. Better take a different teacher. Take very long to grade.
2898,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,3.0,"I am taking a history class NOT an English class. I got A's in English 101 and English 102, there is no reason to focus all of her grading on grammar and punctuation. She uploads course material and gives detailed assignments, however, her assignments are a joke. They are called discussions when in reality they are pointless roleplaying essays."
2899,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS217,4.0,3.0,"She is a good professor, smart. Her lectures were very interesting. Expect to spend about 3 -4 hours reading a week. The course work is fair, not overwhelming but you need to answer the questions she posts very specifically. If you leave out anything she asks for she will dock points. I took at home with 3 kids. Everything you need is provided."
2900,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,1.0,5.0,"Honestly the hardest teacher I had in 2 years of college. Terrible grading criteria. Unrealistic standards for her papers, and docks off a whole letter grade over grammar mistakes. Try your best to avoid her class"
2901,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS217,1.0,5.0,"If you work full time, this is NOT a class to take in the summer. Too much pounded into each week. LOTS of reading, not just book chapters but addt'l sources that must be used in the assignments! Grading is ridiculous! It should be a history class, to learn history, not a writing class. The grading is more on your research ability and writing."
2902,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,"10-15 essay questions(200 words per question), due every 2 weeks. Others are complaining, but she doesn't give any other assignments. There's only 1 test, U.S. Constitution. Tough on grammar/spelling, but doesn't require MLA or references. You're allowed to use outside resources. She wants your responses in your own words so she knows you get it."
2903,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Her lectures are something to look forward to. You would love to attend her lectures because she narrates it as if all of you were present during that time. Although her class homework needs a lot of reading, she gives very clear and informative outlines and summaries. She is prompt and serious when lectures begin but is a very good storyteller."
2904,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Cosgrove is one of the best professors. I learned so much in her class. Take her class if you want to learn. Shes amazing, I highly recommend her class. The documentaries are amazing. Dr. Cosgrove is a feminist and she knows her history."
2905,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST247,3.0,4.0,You have to read the whole book pretty much. It's also A LOT of homework for a history class on top of the sheer reading you need to do. You need tons of free time to take this class.
2906,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST247,1.0,5.0,This teacher asks for a lot and gives little in return. The materials given to read for Her discussions/papers often contain little information to help with answering prompt questions. I don't recommend this teacher if you're looking for an easy class let alone if you're looking for a rewarding experience learning history.
2907,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,You should never take her class. I've never seen tough grader like her. Lecture have to use only text book and her documents but that document has not enough information for her assignment.
2908,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,1.0,5.0,The most horrible professor I ever had . She gives endless assignments and they all have to be don't perfect if not it's a straight up zero . She's very strict with grammar and if you use certain words wrong it's an automatic zero for the assignment. She's not even an English teacher and she's strict when it comes to grammar .
2909,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,2.0,4.0,Dont take. She gives too many assignments and doesnt give enough time. Not doable while working full time job. Some assignments are all due in one day. Less than one week for another assignment due. Gives extra credit. Word count and grammar matters.
2910,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,the most difficult course ive taken. Grading not clear she will mark you off for things not listed in her instructions. Will mark you off 15 points off a 30 point assignment for capitalization and spelling mistakes. average time spend on this per week 8-10 4 hours reading 1 hour video 2 hours assignments. wouldn' recommend pick another professor
2911,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST102,3.0,4.0,"Passionate about history and funny lectures. Learned a lot, but a lot of homework. Accepts late assignments."
2912,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,3.0,"Takes points off if your paragraphs are too short or too long. You could write this long beautiful paper with amazing vocabulary and get a D on it. Too strict of a grader, her modules are atrocious. They dont give you any information to answer the discussion questions. Her directions are not clear and she thinks this is an English class."
2913,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST228,1.0,5.0,The WORST professor I have ever taken!! The textbook is no help and if you ask for her assistance she will only direct you back to the syllabus or to the writing center. Her directions aren't clear and she is not helpful whatsoever!! Be sure to take a different professor because she is TERRIBLE!! DON'T TAKE HER! Honestly wish I could give her a 0!
2914,461435,Sondra,Cosgrove,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),History,HIST101,3.0,3.0,"I advise you don't take her live class. I think you'd be better off with her online class. All her material is on Canvas so there really is no need to be physically present. She is a great teacher as I have learned a lot. Be prepared to read, you'll go through the whole book. No tests per-say but you'll need to expand your learning on paper."
2916,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,2.0,"I've never been good at math, but the textbook he uses is really simple to read. His lectures can be a bit confusing at times, only because he'll explain a bunch of things not to do, rather than just explaining how to do it. But I basically just taught myself using the textbook, which worked perfectly fine. He's a good choice, I would recommend him"
2917,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,3.0,"From someone who hates math and is terrible at it, I really enjoyed this class! For the most part its self taught, but the textbook is really clear about explaining things &amp; the professor is always available if you need any help! You had about 3 days to work on a quiz before turning it in and always had 2 attempts at it to fix mistakes! Great class"
2918,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH132,2.0,4.0,"I dropped the first week. He has just weekly quizzes and two tests (proctored) that he writes himself and you have to show every single step. The textbook he wrote is so confusing. Too much work even just for one assignment a week. If you're strong at math, this is not a bad class. If you're weak at math, take a diff prof. Maybe get a tutor."
2919,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,3.0,Professor Wong is a very logical math teacher. He teaches the content in a way that builds a strong foundation around the rules at hand and builds from there. His method of explanation is easy to follow. His in class collaborative quizzes helps individuals learn from different angles. His tests are thorough and challenging without surprises.
2920,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH181,5.0,3.0,"I took Math181 with another professor the semester before and failed miserably because of a bad professor. Taking it with him was way easier and I understood the material way better. Was in person and then was switched to online during COVID and the class was still great. 4 exams, some open-note quizzes, does everything to help you pass!"
2921,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,3.0,"Im not a person who just understands math but with the notes, textbook, and videos he had available it made sense to me, anytime I had a question, he responded quickly with the help I needed. I would chose to take his class again if needed."
2922,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH127,2.0,4.0,"He teaches and expects you to get it right away. If you are someone who needs extra help and asks questions, he is not for you. Sometimes he will even skip steps because he thinks it should be obvious what he is doing and it is just very aggravating."
2923,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH127,1.0,4.0,This professor is not the best for those students who are a little slower and ask a lot of questions. He has a heavy accent and is kinda hard to understand sometimes. He doesnt explain how to do the problems step by step he will just solve them completley and expect you to understand. I do not recommend him and I would NEVER take him again.
2924,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,4.0,I took his class online and learned it from his notes so I did not buy the textbook and I did not need it! Quizzes are easy but you take 2 procured tests and both tests I left thinking I got at least a B and I always got low C's. If you do not have the correct answer you automatically lose 10/15 points so it's difficult. No room for error.
2925,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,FINITEMATH132,1.0,5.0,"The class itself is very hard. Even though the professor is nice, you can't pass it if you don't understand whats going on. Book is written by him and very hard to understand. Not to mention the final and midterm."
2926,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,3.0,2.0,The class was easy. Prof wong is very simple and easy to work with. If you wanted to you could stay home and learn from the book and then just come in on quiz and test days. No homework. If you did pre calc or higher in high school this course is a refresher practically and i found going to class to be a waste of time. Too easy
2927,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,FINITEMATH132,2.0,5.0,Midterm &amp; Final are most of your grade! Professor Wong has written the textbook so it is free but difficult to understand when doing online and no one to correct your errors. I found myself doing the formulas wrong and failing the tests. 6 Quizzes you get 2 chances to to each one but you must be able to teach yourself and be confident.
2928,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,3.0,"I took his class online and I would recommend you do too if you're okay with learning from the textbook. For me, learning from the textbook was easy and the ability to get 2 attempts on each quiz each week. Very generous with grading finals as well."
2929,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,1.0,5.0,"I am not good with math, but every other teacher I have had explained things better than him. He is poor with explaining things and teaches way too fast in my opinion. I would highly recommend you to not take this class with this professor. I could only imagine how tough the online course for this class would be. I had a private tutor help me more."
2930,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH182,1.0,3.0,very bad don't take him
2931,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,4.0,"Very good professor, 2 in class exam, 6 quizzes online, extra credits. He responded in timely manner. Overall, very good. I would take him again. Thank you."
2932,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,3.0,"His online class was pretty easy. 6 homework assignments due every other week, you get 2 chances at them. Also a midterm and final. He gives you a sample test for both, just study and go over them and they should be a piece of cake. Both tests you have to go to campus for."
2933,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH127,1.0,4.0,"Never had a harder time understanding a teacher. Took his class once, regretted it terribly. A year later he was the only professor available to take my next math course; decided I'd try him out again, perhaps it was my fault it went so bad the first time? Unfortunately, had the same experience and withdrew a week in."
2934,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,2.0,5.0,"if you suck at math i don't recommend this prof., he speaks way too fast and all it is notes notes and more notes. He hardly explains a topic before going to the next and the only thing you are graded on is quizzes and tests ): and you cannot retake them at all!! do not recommend"
2935,516828,Tityik,Wong,College of Southern Nevada (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,3.0,Prof Wong set up a very clear online course. Self paced but must complete quizzes within time period. 2 attempts per quiz. He provided us with old tests to use as study material and was available for any questions. 2 proctored tests you MUST do. The material is not super hard but must put forth the effort to learn it yourself. Would def take again
2937,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,STAT227,5.0,3.0,I actually enjoyed Melanie's class (F19). She's very clear on her lectures and gives notes that we add on. Show up to class ON TIME because that's when quizzes are given. Study because she makes you work for the grade you get.
2938,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,2.0,3.0,"Her notes really do help and you will learn a lot, but get ready to write a lot during lectures. Participation is mandatory, but get ready to get roasted when you are confused about something cause she dislikes explaining things over and overall. Also, she does have a heavy accent and isn't the nicest."
2939,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH261,3.0,5.0,"No one got A in my class. She claimed that the final exam was easy. Well, the highest score in the final is 80 something and the mean is 40ish so it means either she is wrong or we suck. However, there is one good thing about this class. Because it is so hard, the Cal 2 I am taking from another instructor is surprisingly easy."
2940,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,5.0,5.0,"Great professor, always accessible, and even though stats was hard she made it less stressful and taught well."
2941,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,1.0,4.0,kept getting ignored everytime id answer questions she would ask the class.
2942,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,3.0,4.0,She is a nice professor she has notes you can print out amd homework you can print out as well she has everything set. However her accent is very thick and personally could not understand her. She will explain things to you and there is quizzes in the start of every class. Being late is bad very bad because of the quizzes in the start of the class.
2943,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,STAT227,2.0,4.0,If you struggle with math I do not recommend her. She has a strong accent and is very hard to understand. Not helpful when you ask her questions. would only take her as a last resort. must show up for class or she will drop you!
2944,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,5.0,3.0,"I highly recommend her if you are a studious student. You only need to do your homework and take a quick look to read the new lessons, you will get lots of scores. and she gives you extra credit alot. She is willing to explain all of your concern. I really love her!"
2945,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,4.0,3.0,"Assigns reading logs from the textbook, but they're easy points and makes the lecture easier to follow. Was tougher at the start of the semester but very helpful towards the end. Makes study guides out of previous classes' tests and writes new tests specifically for the class. Uses a cheaper textbook too. Allowed heavy calculator use for my class."
2946,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,1.0,5.0,"This professor by far is the worst ever ! I took her last year as a freshman. I previously took statistics in high school, so I thought to myself, this class should be a refresher WRONG! She assigns over 20 pages of notes per class day, she expects too much when she cant teach, hard to understand has heavy accent. Worst ever! Good luck !"
2947,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,STAT227,2.0,4.0,"One of the most difficult teachers I have had and if you and math don't really speak the same language, I suggest you don't have her as your professor and plus she teaches way too fast."
2948,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH261,5.0,2.0,"She great, her lecture is very clear. Test is not one difficult than her lecture."
2949,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH261,2.0,4.0,"This professor's teaching style is mediocre at best. I took Calculus 1 with her over the summer, and she gives quizzes every day and explains some concepts well, but others horribly. Only take her class over an accelerated session if you have already attempted the class once. Tends to dot on A students. Will interrupt you when you ask questions."
2950,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH110,1.0,3.0,"she told this cute guy to leave the class, because he said he was checking the time not texting during lecture. and refused to register him in the class. her teaching style is boring anyway. students falling asleep during lecture. my classmates dropped. Im stuck because my program fye requires me to complete the class. going to class is a nightmare"
2951,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,STAT227,3.0,4.0,"She's a part time teacher at SMC as well and I would not recommend her. There are multiple mistakes in lectures so in the test you'll likely get them wrong. She's sweet for a person but in terms of being a student, she isn't the best professor to teach Statistics because it is a difficult class and she makes it complicated because of the errors."
2952,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,4.0,2.0,Made math easy.
2953,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH227,5.0,1.0,Great Professor I have ever meetShe is very awesome
2954,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,54,5.0,1.0,I took her in Summer 2015 at SMC. Best professor!! Thank you Melanie!
2955,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,125SUMMER,4.5,4.0,summer 2015. She is great and doesnt mind explaining things clearly. would surely take again.
2956,643119,Melanie,Xie,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,4.0,4.0,"I took her 115 Math class at first she was showing her self strict but then she showed very friendly to us. She is an excellent professor, if you want to take her class and pass it, Do ALL the HW and study for the quizzes that will help you  A LOT. "
2958,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,4.0,3.0,He is a great professor if you are serious. He gives lots of writing assignments.

2962,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,1.0,5.0,Horrible teacher he makes u do the midterm 2 times dont take this teacher horrible
2963,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,1.0,2.0,Prof. Dennis is horrible! He always forget what he assigns for homework and does not check for homework! He goes off topic all the time and never remembers what he last lecture. He does not grade your essay and does not give clear essay prompts nor does he give good feedback to improve your writing. Would not recommend him at all!!
2964,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,3.0,He uses his own book that is good and has interesting pieces.  I would definitely say that I would take his class again.  He requires outliesne; otherwise he's great.
2965,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,3.0,Really cares.  Made grammar understandable.  Cooooooooooool!

2969,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG0660,5.0,3.0,ProfSanchez is interesting enough to keep the attention of a student You will definately learn. His class enviorment is freindly and welcoming. You will pass if you attend each class. You will not walk out dumbfounded. He considers everyones input and treats every student fair and courteous. Students aregiven an equal opportunity to enjoy education
2970,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL21,5.0,3.0,He is a very good professor.  You will learn a great amount but you have homework.
2971,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH 28,4.0,2.0,"Mr. Sanchez is a great teacher he makes his class interesting, you read stories in class and explains the stories, if you do all the work you would get an A. He is not hard at all I love his class and his book."
2972,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,26,3.5,4.0,"I really enjoyed his class. I never got bored, he does make you read  and write a lot of essay's but its expected, i mean its college. I liked how he really tried to encourage students to keep pursing and education and to not give up because this is something i struggle with myself.  Overall really good professor."
2973,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH26,4.0,3.0,"He's a cool, funny and chill guy but like the outline he requires you to do sometimes are unnecessary. He makes u write a tons of ideas onto a piece of paper but most of the times I feel like it's too much and not needed. But overall he respect all  his students and he expect for you to do the same. Wouldn't mind taking him again though."
2974,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL29,4.5,3.0,Great teacher.  He expects you to learn.  Great textbook use.
2975,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL26,4.0,3.0,Demands a lot but I learned a lot especially on writing.
2976,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,3477,2.0,3.0,"Outlines, outlines , outlines its all about outlines. Without it he will kinda put you down. Kinda takes to the class like if there dumb. Makes you use his own books."
2977,1127457,Dennis,Sanchez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL26,4.0,4.0,Gives good feedback.  You have to write a lot of papers.  He is  definitely inspirational.
2979,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ001002,5.0,1.0,Best professor ever! My absolute favorite teacher here at ELAC! Very easy and interesting courses. I have taken 2 and plan to take more. He is very lenient and very understanding. No required zoom meetings as of now. Most of the grading consists of weekly quizzes and sometimes discussion posts that are almost always opinion based. Such a fun class.
2980,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ004,5.0,1.0,An amazing guy willing to give you career advice. The class was online and just discussion posts and easy weekly quizzes. Doesn't ask for much besides that. You just use his powerpoints and skim the reading. Other than that it's easy with no papers. Final and midterm are heavy on your grade so be aware but he reuses questions so you'll be fine.
2981,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,ADMJ003,5.0,2.0,I haven't even finished class but this man is a great professor. When you need help with something or anything he doesn't take days to email you back. His class is so easy. I wish I would've been able to meet this man in person instead of just online. Take his class you will not regret i! I promise you that!
2982,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,ADM104,4.0,1.0,Online class so just a few discussion posts and quizzes. That's about it. They were super easy and straight forward. His class is pretty interesting and he's also knowledgeable. He responds to your questions and cuts you some slack as well. A NIce person too. Take him!!
2983,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ001,5.0,3.0,"Posner is an extraordinary professor, he made me want to go to class. There was never a dull moment in his class. He explains things very well and even has guest speakers so the students can hear more about the different types of jobs within Criminal Justice. He goes over test, quizzes and homework to make sure we understand everything."
2984,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,ADMJ003,5.0,3.0,"Professor Posner gives great lectures, he is very clear about what he expects from his students and he shares personal stories with class so if you like AJ subject you will definitely enjoy this class!"
2985,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ1,5.0,2.0,"Professor Posner is absolutely the best! He gives it to you straight and simple. His teaching style helped me understand everything and put it to perspective. He will inform you of everything that will be in midterm/final and review it with you. Bonus, he is absolutely hilarious! I definitely recommend taking him."
2986,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ001,5.0,1.0,"Professor Posner is AMAZING. He's funny, tell's you EXACTLY what needs to be studied for the exams, and what need's to be learned. A real jokester but always informs you of whats in the news and what's going on currently. There's nobody better to take these classes with!"
2987,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ160,5.0,2.0,Professor Posner is an amazing teacher who really cares about his students.
2988,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ004,5.0,3.0,"Sergeant Posner is the best AJ professor at ELAC. He cares about his students and teaches like no one else. I took him for AJ 1 &amp; 4, and he made me want to pursuit a career in the criminal justice field. Whatever it is that you need, he is always there for you. We need more professors like him in every institution. A true GEM and a kind soul."
2989,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ001,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor, Wants students to succeed. Class was Very interesting, Note taking is very important. Helps out with the mid-term &amp; finals. Keep very handout for extra credit."

2994,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,AJ3,5.0,2.0,One of the funniest but VERY informative professors.

Take this professor you will not regret it!
2997,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,ADMIN0000,5.0,1.0,Sgt. Posner is a great teacher. He is really funny even though he doesn't like the Celtics and beliefs that the lakers are a better team. Overall you don't have to attend class to pass just show up for the midterm and final reviews which he provides you with the questions and all the answers you need. I have taken him for 8 AJ classes and got an A
2998,400995,Wayne,Posner,East Los Angeles College,Criminal Justice,ADMJUS001,5.0,2.0,POSNER is great. Honestly. He really cares about his students and HE REALLY WANTS YOU TO PASS. He's funny and his lectures are so interesting! Glad to have been his student.
3000,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,4.0,5.0,"Everyone's RIGHT! She IS tough! Depends how confident/comfortable u r w/Chem. If u r more-novice, like me, it WILL BE challenging. She HAS high expectations, goes more in-depth than the avg. &amp; grades TOUGH. BUT, she's helpful/accessible &amp; CARING (+sassy). This forces u to REALLY get the material. YOU WILL LEARN--100%. Only, lower odds getting an A."
3001,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,1.0,4.0,"Currently taking this course with Professor Valverde and hating Chemistry because of it. She has a ""my way or the high way"" type of teaching, so if you're like me and not understanding what the hell she is saying, youtube is your best friend. She also does not proofread her work before submitting. Attitude when challenged, just a heads up."
3002,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible professor. I rather drag my body across shards of glass than taking her again. Everyone in my zoom meeting thinks she's the worst professor we've ever taken. She's rude, disrespectful, condescending, does not know how to teach. Has very limited chemistry knowledge is always making mistakes. She humiliates you. Horrrible"
3003,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,5.0,3.0,"I am currently taking her for her Intro to Chem class for a summer term. Despite popular belief, she is very clear &amp; patient in explaining very abstract concepts. I have had taken a chemistry class before at a 4 year &amp; she is very clear and fair. Students who can't handle this level of slow &amp; clear teaching are in for a rude awakening upon transfer"
3004,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,1.0,3.0,"Be weary, you will end up with a lot more questions than answers."
3005,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,Everyone saying that Professor V was a bad teacher is a student who expects to get an A just for showing up. You REALLY have to work for this class and she will help you as much as she possibly can. She's very passionate about chemistry/very helpful. Loved her class and wish I could take her again. It's rare to find teachers that actually care.
3006,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM0000,1.0,4.0,im not even a student in her class but the experiences my classmates have had with her is disappointing. you would think a latina woman in the sciences would be an idol to the raza and be an example of si se pudo!! but her ego is that of anyother hispanic family member who thinks they are the ish. she comments in spanish of her speaking ish .
3007,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"show too much attitude, have you to solve problems in her way, which is rigid for science classes. arranges all the tables in a circle, not necessary for college students. too proud of her limited knowledge on chemistry. you will pass her class depend on whether you like her personality, otherwise, you will suffer."
3008,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,1.0,"Not approachable, rude, give students an attitude for no reason, very condescending, thinks she's always right, has mood swings, spends time on social media when she should be answering student's questions, lectures off the book but won't spend time on too much detail (you have to self teach), tests don't reflect lecture, will put you on the spot"
3009,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,2.0,3.0,She cares about her students and wants them to do good in class but she calls on people and will put them on the spot. Even when they don't know she'll keep them on the spot. She has favoritism so if you talk to her a lot she will most likely give you a better grade. I think she grades based on what she things you deserve instead of actual grades
3010,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,4.0,4.0,"It's true that professor Valverde is tough on her students, however, she is passionate about chemistry and will go out of her way to make sure her students are learning. She puts a lot of focus on students who are struggling but by the end of the semester they ace their exams. If you are going to take her class, be prepared to work!"
3011,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,2.0,4.0,"does like one example from each topic she teaches which is NOT enough bc her tests are so long and hard! she doesnt let you take notes in class bc she wants you to pay attention. she threw a lab report, 10 min oral presentation, an exam, and final all on us in 2 weeks all bc she fell behind and was so disorganized. if youre not a chem maj dont take"
3012,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,This professor is totally awesome! She is very helpful and is very caring toward her students! As long as you go over your notes and do the practice she assigns you will be fine! She calls on you to make sure you are learning! If you do not understand something she will go over it until you do! She is just wonderful!!
3013,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,"Professor Valverde is amazing. She cares about her students and if you just give her a chance and actually ask for help during office hours, she will go above and beyond to help you and advice you. She is very inspirational. Do your part and she will do hers. She is only intimidating because she is very honest and calls on you so you will learn."
3014,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,she is a tough. Mandatory office hour is always needed. NOT RECOMMEND!
3015,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,I am scared of her personality. she is mean and rude.
3016,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,Best chemistry prof at Elac. She actually cares and goes out of her way to make sure you learn. I learned so much . It is nice to know someone does care for the students . Will take her again and again .
3017,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,5.0,4.0,"Valverde is one of the best professors in this department. Don't believe many of the negative things people have said about her. True, she's tough BUT she is passionate about Chemistry. She wants the students to truly understand and learn the subject which is why she will add you until you understand. Ask questions and participate! She is awesome!!"
3018,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,4.0,4.0,WILL PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. NO OFFICE HOURS IN SUMMER.
3019,947088,Vanessa,Valverde,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,2.0,3.0,Mandatory office hours. :(
3021,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"There are two discussions, two reviews, and one exam for each chapter. There are about 6 chapters, one is due every week to week and a half. The exam answers come straight from the lecture modules, do not buy the textbook. I took a short term class the first half of the semester and it was not too quick paced for me."
3022,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Davey was very strict but the class was not hard, she gives very clear instructions and grading guidelines. Just print out the lectures, I stopped reading the book halfway through the class because everything you need to know is in the modules. You can study them and use it on your tests/exams."
3023,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,1.0,3.0,Horrible.
3024,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING PROFESSOR! She required a textbook but I didn't open the book, not once. Online class, so she taught from PPT lectures. Lectures are funny, easy to read, &amp; short. Taught with practical real-life examples. Each chapter was divided into 4-6 short lectures, 2 short quizzes, 1 exam on the entire chapter, no midterm or final. Very resourceful"
3025,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH01,1.0,2.0,I personally didnt enjoy her class. Doesnt give feedback and is very rude / strict.
3026,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,Professor Davey is honestly the best Professor for Psych class. I took her online all though she assigns a lot of work they are very simple. I didnt use a textbook even though it was required but her lectures were very detailed and have all the information you need. I would definitely recommend her.
3027,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"Took the short term online class for Pysch 001. I have an extremely busy work schedule and am taking 3 other online classes and still was able to pass this class with an A. Gives you a clear breakdown on how the class assignments will be due, all tests and reviews can be studied off of the module notes given. I don't think I even opened my book."
3028,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH01,5.0,3.0,I took her class online for the summer. Professor Davey was clear and concise about what she expected from her students. She provided modules where she explained the course work very well. She also responds to your emails in a promptly manner. I highly suggest her if you need to take a psychology course.
3029,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY52,5.0,2.0,"Professor Davey is one of the easiest, funniest, and cool professors I've had! This class is so fun &amp; you learn A LOT! The notes are a DIRECT outline for the exams, SO STUDY IT WELL! Pay attention to slides she takes extra time on. She's very open, I would definitely take her again if I were a Psych major :)"
3030,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,1.0,I took professor Sherrie for PSYCH 1 online and she makes it very interesting. She uploads many lectures and separates them by segments. For every segment there's a 10 - 20 question quiz and a 40 question test. You don't need the book. Reading the lecture seems like you're actually in her class. I would definitely take again! I recommend her 100%
3031,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY001,5.0,2.0,Took this class online for the winter session and received an A. Don't buy the book you don't need it! All the quizzes and exams are based on the module lectures. As long as you make sure you get everything turned in by the deadline it's an easy A. Her lectures were actually pretty fun to read!
3032,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,3.0,4.0,"Took this class online and I received an A. Professor Davey is organized and clear in what she expects. Her lectures are fun to read through and informative. My best advise is to not take this class lightly, be organized and stay on top of everything! Take notes from the book/ lecture and you will do well on the quiz/ exam which can be difficult"
3033,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,4.0,"Just finished taking her Winter online class. It was really great! Her lectures are really fun to read. Her modules are very organized and her quizzes are labeled to coincide with lectures, so it is really easy to study for each quiz/exam. Make sure you stay on top of every discussion, assignment and modules by visiting it every time."
3034,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH052,5.0,2.0,DON'T GET A TEXT BOOK!!! Professor Davey is absolutely amazing and really enjoys her job and as a student you can see it. Professor Davey doesn't only care for her students' to pass but she really cares for her students' to actually leave her class with knew knowledge about ourselves and what we want in future relationships. Would take her again!!!
3035,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH52,5.0,3.0,"Dont get the textbook!!!! Not needed at all. Lectures are clear and to the point. 5 or 6 quizzes in total. Theyre not bad, multiple choice and written portions. If you understand the concepts and vocab from the lectures you should get A's on them. One three page reflection paper and one group project. Try not to miss class."
3036,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH01,4.0,1.0,"I just finished taking her online class and ended up with a solid B. Although it was a very easy class, she is definitely a rude professor and procrastinates on grading papers. 10 Exam reviews, around 30 discussions with five peer responses per module, 6 Exams, and 1 Self Reflection Essay(took two months to get a grade). No text book required."
3037,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSHYC01,5.0,3.0,"She writes her own lectures for her online students and they are great to read,  she appeals to her audience. You'll learn and have fun. Grading is clear and there is quite a bit of reading but you won't even feel it. She recommends a book but you don't really use it."
3038,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH52,5.0,2.0,"Professor Davey is the best. She's really nice, motivating, engaging, &amp; she'll be their for the students. Their are 3 tests &amp; a take home final. 1 group presentation. Lectures are fill-in PowePoints. Tests are based on lecture. Their is 1 short paper to write &amp; fun self-assessments. There is never a boring moment &amp; you'll learn alot from her class."
3039,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY001,4.0,1.0,Easy A class as long as you pay attention to assignments. No textbook required
3040,953751,Sherrie,Davey,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY001,4.0,3.0,"One of the best at ELAC. Would definitely recommend taking her because she makes learning so fun. Took her twice actually! Funny, intelligent and you LEARN!"
3042,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHI06,1.0,5.0,Dont take class with this professor!!!!! Lots of homework we had 10-13 assignments assigned for one week!!! Quizzes are long and hard !!! Tough grader ! And Professor is a jerk !Dont take this class unless you are planning to stress over a ton of homework !!
3043,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,My professor really gaves a good point of view which helps my curiosity answered and I satisfy on many of his opinion.
3044,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,3.0,I loved this professor and enjoyed this class so much. He is very good at communication. Prof Sigman had help me pass a class that i already had twice. His homework comments made a huge difference and the ideas started making more sense to me.
3045,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,I would like to express my appreciation for being a wise and amazing teacher who always dedicate his time to create positive learning experiences to help bring out the best in his students.
3046,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,Prof Sigman is a good lecture. He helped me pass this class without any problem.
3047,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL6,5.0,4.0,"Prof Sigman helped me pass a class that I already had failed twice. His homework comments made a huge difference and the ideas started making more sense to me. Even as an online class, the teaching was better than my other attempts. It's kind of a miracle that I passed logic!"
3048,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL01,5.0,3.0,I don't understand the bad reviews. You get what you sign up for. Prof. Sigman assigns a lot of reading and it takes critical thinking to understand the concepts. He explains everything wonderfully and provides lots of feedback on essays. He may seem intimidating but really he is just passionate about Philosophy and is actually very understanding.
3049,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHI06,5.0,3.0,"Great Professor! What made the course challenging was the fast pace. I took a short summer session online. Manage your time wisely!!! (especially if you take a short semester) Quizes and exams are based of reading and HW. HW is very important for learning, practicing, and getting a feel for the material. Be responsible and you will pass!"
3050,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL006,1.0,5.0,Awful. The quizzes r so hard he gives WAY TOO MUCH HW and he leaves rude comments on assignments. I genuinely try on my assignments and all he does is grade them harshly and tell me what I cant do without giving me tips to fix it. This class was my enemy and would never take one of his classes again
3051,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHILOS006,1.0,4.0,Would not recommend this professor. He gives way too much work. I dont think he understands that college students have other priorities too his class was so hard and so much work. Too much for a philosophy class
3052,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL006,1.0,5.0,I would not recommend taking Professor Sigman for a class. He gives way too much work for you to complete usually most of the assignments are all due the same day which doesnt really give you time. I took this class for the summer it was a complete mess too much work and the exams and quizzes are way too hard.
3053,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,1.0,5.0,I dont recommend taking his class because of the exams. He makes u write a lot during the exams and u need to write two separate essays under an hour.
3054,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,COS126,4.0,4.0,"Very hard test , too much assignments"
3055,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL06,5.0,3.0,Sooooooooo glad I took this online class with professor Sigman because he provided a clear trail through lots of different ideas and topics. I really liked his encouragement and all of the announcements that kept me on top of my homework. Follow the game plan &amp; you'll be fine. Much better than the other prof I took the class with.
3056,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,"Sigman is an excellent professor for serious students. If you don't do the assigned reading then you're gonna have trouble on the tests. His lectures and slides are super helpful if you've done your homework, but you cannot just rely on them alsone to pass the class."
3057,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,1.0,5.0,"Mr. Sigman doesnt allow phone usage during class and doesnt allow his PowerPoints to be seen outside of class, so taking a lot of handwritten notes is necessary in this class! He goes through the slides very quickly, so students need to write at a fast pace or else they wont get everything they need to know for exams."
3058,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL006,1.0,1.0,Professor Sigman is a horrible professor if you choose to take his online class just don't. Every time I turned in an assignment he would write back rude comments about my work even though I tried. In one of the comments he basically said that I don't understand the use of language yet in order for me to do the exercises he posts for us.
3059,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHILO006,1.0,4.0,"Took his class online. he is very vague on what the assignments have to be about and it is so much reading.. He also does not explain what you did wrong he just points it out and how bad the work you did is. It is clearly shown he odes not care for his students. Wasted my time, i would suggest a different philos professor."
3060,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,3.0,4.0,"Look, don't take philosophy if you do not want a class with heavy writing and critical analysis. Philosophy is hard in general and if you are looking to fulfill G.E, I do not recommend taking this class. Although Sigman is cocky, he challenges you to question certain beliefs in order to expand your critical thinking skills. Class is not an easy A."
3061,224164,Michael,Sigman,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,1.0,5.0,"Philosophy one is boring because Sigman has made it torture for his students. He does not allow his students to use their laptops to take notes and they must hand write everything out, which is impossible because he talks fast! He also shows his PowerPoints very quickly so you wont have enough time to write everything down!"
3063,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,I took this class during Spring of 2020 and I loved it. I've never enjoyed English class but Professor Gray made it very fun and interesting. I wish he taught English 102. He's also very understanding and organized. He also tells you how you can better yourself as a writer.
3064,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,3.0,"Took him for a summer, didn't need a specific textbook, he provided free links for all the readings. Mostly discussions and a lot of reading with essays of course, but he's really caring and funny. I'd 100% take him again, and he's an easy grader. No zoom meetings. 3 big essays total with other homework in-between. Amazing professor!"
3065,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL101,5.0,4.0,"What an amazing class. He is so explicit with every homework. He gives examples and gives really good feedbacks. Literally, his feedback is so specific and detailed that it helps you prepare how to do the next assignment. Also, his assignments include things like readings and writings but it is not too hard because the topics are interesting."
3066,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,I really recommend him as an English professor because he makes English really fun. He's very understanding and accessible outside of class. He does give a lot of work and you'll have 3 essays and a midterm. I'm almost done with the class and I currently have an A. He is very funny and detailed oriented. Really wish he teach eng102 so I can take it
3067,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,I withdrew from several English teachers classes prior to taking Mr Grays class. Im glad I took his online course. He is very helpful. The work is easy because he guides you every step of the way. By far the best online instructor that Ive encountered. I would highly recommend.
3068,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! Would highly recommend him, he taught me so much. Easy to pass and youll enjoy your time there."
3069,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,"I took his online course for Fall 2019. His prompts are clear and when followed you will get max amount of points. He really shoes you how to build an essay, but theres 3 big essays throughout the semester and 1 essay midterm and 1 essay final. He gives constant assignments that are due every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday usually but are reasonable."
3070,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Gray is the best English professor I've experienced at ELAC. He is so caring and passionate about what he teaches. The information he teaches actually makes you think and is extremely applicable to real life. He really helps improve your essay writing skills, and is very approachable when it comes to asking for help. Highly recommend!!"
3071,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,"I wish I could take Prof Gray again, he is an amazing dude. Assignments are actually fun and engaging - if you're not great at writing essays, talk to him after class and he will warm up to you and help you out. Totally easygoing, even the class clowns warmed up to him. His essays aren't hard at all, and he has a lot of extra credit options!"
3072,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,4.0,3.0,He's generally a good professor -- but you have to read the texts.
3073,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor! Made me not want to miss a single class. His lectures were very interesting and he uses Canvas for assignments and tests. If you have a hard time learning online, don't worry because he literally provides clear requirements and stays on top of his messages. I'm excited to learn from him again for Eng103 Online."
3074,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,4.0,2.0,"Professor Gray provided great feedback when asked questions about how to write my essay. As well, with our SI, Amber, I slowly learned how to write better as I never attended High School. I felt his grading was relaxed, especially if he sees potential. Do keep in mind, however, is the class can get a bit ""political"" and talk about current events."
3075,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,Excellent professor! I am currently in my 3rd week and I love my online class. One textbook for the semester and I rented from Amazon. Very considerate grader and has amazing patience. I can tell he has a passion to teach well and wants us to succeed. He provides great feedback and replies fast! I highly recommend English 101 online.
3076,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,4.0,3.0,"Class is discussion and participation heavy (but they were great). There is readings and hwk that will be relevant to the overall class so try not to miss it. Nothing horrible to say, but do the work and he is easy to talk to so don't be scared to ask for his guidance on your essays if need be."
3077,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG205,5.0,4.0,"Loved! Loved! the class. Professor is super nice and helps you a lot. I swear if you participate, do the readings and the discussions, there's no reason not to pass this class with flying colors. On top of that the lectures are just not a drag so that's always a plus. The discussions online and in class are always fun and interesting."
3078,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH101,5.0,2.0,Professor Gray is very organized. The topics covered are super interesting and relatable for modern day. 3 essays. 1 midterm essay on Ready Player One and 1 final. U need to purchase 2 books or u can rent an ebook which is better. Gives GREAT feedback and is very respectable. I really enjoyed his online class. I would definitely take again.
3079,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,"English 101. Love this professor, his topics for essays are interesting and his class in not boring. He is very reasonable and try's his best to understand his students. I recommend this professor 100%!!!!!! he is a fair grader and good sense of humor. Do your work and reading and try your best and you will be happy."
3080,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,4.0,2.0,"One of the best Professor I have ever had, great class!"
3081,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG216,5.0,3.0,"Extremely passionate about what he teaches, and the literary criticisms you read in class are really fascinating. Discussion questions forced insight and critical thinking to the point where I never thought about word count. Meaningful and attentive participation in class is what saves your grade. It certainly saved mine. He's funny and easy-going!"
3082,941924,Jeff,Gray,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,4.0,2.0,just do the few essays he assigns decent and you'll pass
3084,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,4.0,She really doesnt care for the students. Does not give extra credit. Homework on mathxl which is very pricey. Worst professor Ive took at ELAC.
3085,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,5.0,4.0,Best marh teacher I've ever had. She teaches very well. Just study your hw for the quizzes and test and you should be good. I could have gotten a better grade but because of the covid situation online classes has been pretty new to me.
3086,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,3.0,4.0,I took her 6 am class but wasn't the best decision. I struggled w precal in HS and fairly understood this class. Gives lots of hw for it to be worth 5 pts per chapter. Review isn't alike to the actual tests Pay attention in class and if needed go to tutoring. Would often sleep during the first hour until daylight savings.
3087,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,3.0,5.0,"Exams are the majority of your grade. Super lazy &amp; relies on MathXL even though homework comprises only 10% of the grade. Her personality is very to the point. Towards the end she started making us complete reading logs because noone asked questions. Its a 6:30AM class!!!!!! People arent asking questions because they're tired,lady."
3088,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,4.0,Worst math professor Ive ever took. Dont take her.
3089,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,3.0,"She is the BEST math prof I have EVER had. I have taken Stats before, &amp;dropped it. I suffer from math anxiety, and her clear lessons and her patience really helped! But she is very good and doesn't use the book so you don't have to spend the money on the book. The tests are NOT surprises! you get tested on the study guide. Would DEF recommend."
3090,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,5.0,4.0,"I took her hybrid class. The quizzes and homework are much harder than the actual exams. Homework and Quizzes are done online through MathXL. Exams in class. She can rush through lessons because we meet only once a week,and she did point out that we had to do a lot of studying on our own at the beginning of the semester."
3091,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,3.0,4.0,Shes an ok instructor but Rushes trough lectures. Lots of homework and does not give extra credit. Her study guides are to long and are not similar to test.
3092,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,3.0,5.0,"I don't recommend taking her Hybrid class. I need to have a full time class lecture where I can understand the problems and ask the professor questions I may have in person, not through a computer. It is also difficult because you have to find the answers to your questions in the book and it can get frustrating when you don't understand a problem."
3093,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,5.0,3.0,AMAZING PROFESSOR!!!! Style of teaching is great. All concepts she goes over is well taught. Best math teacher in campus
3094,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,5.0,3.0,"You do have to put in the individual time to understand the material, but she does go over it in class before the assignment are due. The book is not required because she will require you to purchase Mathxl which will go through the problem step by step. Drops lowest quiz and test. I was not good at math before taking this class."
3095,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,5.0,4.0,"She's a great professor. Explains the material very thoroughly but you MUST put in the extra time to study. By far, the best math professor I've taken at ELAC."
3096,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH230,3.0,3.0,She goes through lectures quick . Doesnt give you extra credit. Wont let you use notes or a flash card for test or quizzes. But she does drop lowest quiz and test. Which doesnt really make a huge difference. But its something.
3097,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,4.0,3.0,she's a great teacher gives exams and final and quizzes but she goes over everything she's a great teacher everything is clear and do-able i don't hate going to her class
3098,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,5.0,3.0,"What an EXEPTIONAL professor!! Took 6am class in winter, she covered a lot quickly but made math easy to understand with CLEAR lectures. She wont move on until you understand. Very willing to answer questions when you dont. Uses MathXL for homework. Homework problems are harder than quizzes/tests so do your homework!! Drops lowest quiz/test."
3099,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING! Lectures are very understandable. Homework &amp; study guides online. Also, she drops the lowest exam with the final grade (if its higher). You will definitely learn and understand."
3100,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,4.0,3.0,"Considering this was my first hybrid class, Professor Panchal made it a great experience. Buying the book isn't necessary because the program she uses helps you understand the problem step by step. Gives two attempts for quizzes, and has study guides for tests which are also fairly easy. Drops lowest quiz score. I will be taking her again for 125"
3101,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH230,5.0,3.0,"professor Panchal is one of the best math professors ive had. her lectures are straightforward, and incredibly clear. the homework helps a lot due to how similar the problems are in the exams. she does give quizes every week or so, but its always on recent material. its a very simple class if you do your homework and briefly study!"
3102,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,5.0,3.0,"Panchal's is a very good teacher, and her lectures are very understandable. Also, she cares  about her students passing the class. All you have to do is do the homework and the study guide, and you should pass the class."
3103,1334076,Mona,Panchal,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,4.0,3.0,Took for math 115 at first she can seem intimading and hard but quickly you realize she does care that each of her student passes 2 quizzes per week but it is based on what she lectured recently her lecutures are very easy to understand she does drop 2 quizzes and 2 chapter tests
3105,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,EARTHSCI1,1.0,4.0,"Honestly, any professor that starts out the semester with ""I'm not a tough grader"" has probably been reading his reviews here; why not just copy and paste the reviews from here into the syllabus on day 1? The homework assignments have got to be flawless, as if we have already mastered and majored in Earth Science. Better off with another prof."
3106,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,EARTH001,1.0,3.0,I just show my simple basic respect to all the professors I had taken. But I will probably not going to recommend this professor to my friends in the future. I remember I had a nice English Professor from the English Department. I also remember that the first time I feel extra credit won't do too much to improve my grade. That's his course.
3107,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,3.0,4.0,"He was funny, but an extremely tough grader. Your hmwk has to be perfection. His daily quizzes are easy because they are literally mirror his lectures. The final was basically all the quizzes combined. He drops lowest hmwk, quiz, offers 2 10 extra credit opportunities (essay reflection 1-2 ), and rounds your grade if you are like an 69,79,89, etc."
3108,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,GEO4,1.0,3.0,"Worst professor sucks at teaching, boring lectures and does not give you credit for work you do. DO NOT TAKE HIM WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3109,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,4.0,4.0,"Took him over the summer for 5 weeks. He gives you a fair amount of work and a quiz everyday based on lecture from day before and reading. Just pay attention and ask questions, visit office hours for help! Really not that bad!!"
3110,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,1.0,5.0,"This class is hilariously bad. Really, it's that bad you want to laugh. Every time you walk out of class you will say to yourself, ""what was that?"" You won't learn anything from this class. I cant believe I signed up for this."
3111,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,EARTH01,1.0,5.0,He literally doesn't teach you. He goes by PowerPoints like there's no tomorrow. He repeats basic things from the chapter but gives out homework that should be given to university professors. The book literally won't help you with his homework no matter how much you re-read it. If you ask him a question he looks at you like your stupid. Run away!!!
3112,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,2.0,4.0,"So I am halfway through with this class and I want to share some knowledge. He can be better. He does not give too much homework because he does give a week to do them (though they are in packets). BUT his quizzes are ANNOYING. They are once a week and does not mention the content that is on the quiz. Yeah, this class is on the IGETC and CSU but NO"
3113,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,4.0,3.0,"How to Pass. Not only do the reading, take notes on it BEFORE class. During lecture, HIGHLIGHT or star points he goes over in slides and add anything additional. These are your quiz questions. Don't memorize, understand underlying concept. Homework, EMAIL him or office hours HE WILL EXPLAIN THE ANSWER TO YOU. Lastly, save quizzes for final."
3114,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,1.0,5.0,"Im taking him in oceanography litterly right now ,hes nice and all but his grading criteria sucks litterly will fail 95-98% of all ypur homeworks even if the answer is correct or partially true ,whines later that were not doing enough and complains about office hours . No midterms ever but he gives daily quizzes 15 questions each."
3115,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,EARTHSCIENCE1,2.0,4.0,"I will not be taking his class again. He tries to be funny with literally pun after horrible pun. I then asked him what something meant on the power point and he said ""oh it's in the glossary of you're textbook"" thanks... I ASKED HIM CAUSE HES THE TEACHER WE PAY WITH OUR TUITION. Why didn't I just get an answer back? Isn't that like... the job?!"
3116,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,1.0,4.0,"This guy was over 20+ mins. late to his own class bc ""he forgot"" and when the majority of the class left, he still didn't give us a break. We showed up to the next class meeting and he didn't review anything bc we ""shouldn't have assumed and left"". You'll have quizzes, no midterm, &amp; 1 comprehensive final based on all the quiz questions. ABORT NOW!"
3117,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,1.0,5.0,"He's a very tough grader. The homework he assigns is pretty hard, his weekly quizzes are hard even if you read the material, he goes through the lecture very fast and will not slow down, and pretty sure he failed most of his remaining students."
3118,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,2.0,4.0,He's a very tough grader! Quizes have trick questions. no midterms just one final! goes through slides very quickly and talks during presentations so you have to also take notes of what hes saying at the same time. can be awkward sometimes with cheesy jokes. class is almost always empty. there were about 20 at first then ended up being about 10.
3119,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,GEO01,1.0,5.0,"Hes class is hard, rates you to harshly"
3120,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,OCEAN001,1.0,5.0,"I was talking him for the summer semester and for a 5 week classes I had to drop the class because he was grading supper hard and when we would do the quizzes they were not what we read, DO NOT TAKE HIM AT ALL"
3121,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,GEOL001,1.0,5.0,"Don't expect to write everything down on his slides because he goes through very swiftly. Those are key point on quizzes. Also the quizzes are very hard, even if you study will only getting a D. The grading is tough on homework! Don't take him!"
3122,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,EARTH01,1.0,5.0,"worst professor ever, DO NOT TAKE."
3123,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,EARTHSCIENCE2,1.0,5.0,"This professor needs to be REPORTED. He supposedly gives extra credit for going on field trips. So on this one field trip he got 2 flat tires and made 5 people that went with him in his car split the cost of the tires. Some ppl went  to  ""office hours"" and overheard the teacher  talk about money exchanges and they visually saw the tire receipt."
3124,574190,Randy,Adsit,East Los Angeles College,Geology,EARTH001,1.0,4.0,"Adsit you are failing your students!  I have always had a level of respect for my Professors, and acknowledge students responsibility over their success. However Adsit   is belittling to his students ;His quizzes are extremely difficult even if you study. He failed 80% of his class; highest grade was a C in his class.  Dean please do something."

She really cares about her student's success and is there for us day in, and day out. Her patience and greatest act of optimism and her positive outlook is what we need in these times of trouble.

3134,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD44,5.0,2.0,She is amazing and the best teacher in The Child Development department She will help you when needed answers emails quickly she made the classes i took just amazing she made me want to come to class would recomand to anyone wanting to take 44-45 CD

3136,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD001,5.0,2.0,Has a lot of extra credit. Really entertaining. This is a class where if your going to fail you have to try. As long as you take notes and pay attention and make the time to study you will know all info for the tests and final..
3137,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD001,5.0,1.0,She is an amazing professor. Very understanding and easy going. For you to get an A you must turn in work on time but if turned in late you loose some points not all. Took her for CD1 and CD2 and got an A for both.
3138,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD2,5.0,4.0,She very nice to the Disability student she help you learn a lot about kids and become a teacher for us
3139,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD02,5.0,1.0,Her classes fill up fast. Better sign up fast before she has no more space in her class. There is usually a long line of students who signed up late. Its first come first served.
3140,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD02,5.0,4.0,"She's supper smart, professional, organized, accessible, funny, understanding and genuine. She is a great human being and a great professor."

3143,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD001,5.0,3.0,Mendiola one of the best Professor at ELAC. Her lectures are fun and interesting in learning. I would totally take her again.
3144,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD02,5.0,2.0,just two easy test in FALL. she is a very good professor! so nice and patient and helpful. it is the reason why her waiting list is so long! easy to get A if you join every class. cause almost every class has paperwork! she will tell you more information more than consoler in college!
3145,307455,Alicia,Mendiola,East Los Angeles College,Child &amp; Family Studies,CD02,5.0,1.0,Everyone majoring in child development needs to take this professor. She will inspire you if you arent already inspired enough. She brings in inspirational speakers such as former students who took her classes and got their degrees. My favorite story was billy troung :) hearing stories like these give me a lot of hope to continue studying.
3147,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001H,2.0,4.0,"Stem students stay away. This class is extremely time consuming and not worth the effort. This canvas has lots of due dates wrong, has unnecessary long explanations, and just overall overwhelming to a student starting the class. The time you trade for taking this class can be better spent on core math classes imo."
3148,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL006,5.0,3.0,"I had a good experience with Prof. Snead, his lectures were slightly dull but easy to comprehend. He makes sure everyone is up to speed, and will try to explain things in different ways until it makes sense to you. He gives homework out frequently but also gives lots of extra credit. Follow your study guide and you'll pass his tests."
3149,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,4.0,4.0,"I took him for 5 weeks online philo 001 class. You will have to work in this class, rely heavily on the textbook. I started off bad with a C average on assignments but went up slowly to a B. Snead is very understanding and will work with you. I had an emergency during finals and he gave me an extension and accommodate to my needs. Highly Recommend"
3150,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,1.0,5.0,I will never take this professor ever again. Not only does he give you tons of work and expect you to finish it as if you don't have any other classes he also grades harshly taking points off for meaningless things. He made the class extremely stressful and even though I did all the work and extra credit I ended up with a B. Terrible teacher!
3151,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHILOS001,4.0,4.0,"Took his online class. Very straightforward and gives clear grading criteria. However, be prepared to read and write. Overall, he is a great professor and I recommend his class."
3152,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHILOS001,2.0,3.0,"Most annoying online class ever. Tests require flipping through dozens of pages to find one sentence and answer multiple choice. Usually this isn't hard at all, but the questions are so vague and the answers so specific that you are guaranteed to miss questions. I read the 100 page chapters and STILL missed questions. Only positive is Extra credit"
3153,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,"Took his 8 wks online course. Fairly easy until the last 2 wks, you have regular assignments along with w/ 7 pg essay and final. I will be in contact if there is some issue or misunderstanding and provides EC. Lots of reading, but generally it's interesting. Do all the Cengage hw assignments and discussions. He rounded my 89% to an A."
3154,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,2.0,5.0,"Last few weeks of class is very stressful. You have a discussion (3 different parts), exam, cengage hw, and a 7 page essay all due A WEEK BEFORE FINALS WEEK. Hell give you 2 extra credits tho: (1) Exam  (2) 2-3 page essay reflection."
3155,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,4.0,5.0,Class is hard but the professors is really nice and helpful. You also need to buy cengage to access your hws which is around 70-100$ not worth it for an 8week course.
3156,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,1.0,5.0,"I took his online PHILO 001 class. It was ok until we hit the last week of class. Not only did we have to do the regular weekly assignment (Discussion, respond to a classmate, chapter summary, chapter test), we also had to do a final test (100 questions) and a 7 page essay. So unnecessary. Class is EXTREMELY BORING and stressful."
3157,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,It was not very easy class to begin with but as you move along it gets better and better. Professor adjusts the speed and works with you to help you get good grade. Extra credit quiz is gorgeous to bring your score up. All you need to do is participate and read the book and you will get an A.
3158,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHILOS001,5.0,3.0,He really cares about his students and wants you to succeed in his class. Just do all the work and you'll pass also do the extra credit. Very manageable if you're taking other courses.
3159,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,1.0,5.0,He was a very difficult teacher
3160,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,4.0,"Took fall class 8 week session. Class is pretty easy. Make sure to read, complete assignments, quizzes and a research paper was also required to pass the class."
3161,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,2.0,"When it came to discussions, he was very lenient on the grading scale and had 6 multiple choice test including final. one 7 page essay."
3162,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL08,5.0,3.0,"BEST PHILOSOPHY TEACHER OUT THERE! You NEED the textbook, without it you will fall behind plus he assigns homework from the text regularly. If you skip class you'll fall behind and get lost! No writing assignments, just 4 or 5 quizzes based on certain chapters, the midterm, and the final. The final is cumulative so study! I definitely recommend!!"
3163,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL012,5.0,4.0,Most amazing philosophy professor around!
3164,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,1.0,"well, there is some problem during the final, so the prof canceled the final, got a straight A."
3165,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL001,5.0,2.0,"""WE'LL, HERE YA GO""  -  Snead   Take him, you won't regret it. He makes philosophy amazing."
3166,350517,Tim,Snead,East Los Angeles College,Philosophy,PHIL101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Snead clearly states what he expects of students. A textbook is a must for this course, he wants students to reference the book as much as possible in discussions. The tests are easy but based on the textbook so do your reading! Snead made my first online class a breeze. Highly recommended."
3168,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,4.0,"I dont recommend taking this course with him, he doesnt slow down and he doesnt understand most of us have a different major. Many of us need this class for an A.A, slow down and be patient. Hes tough and assumes you are a math major"
3169,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,5.0,Professor assumes that everyone should be really good at math and doesnt understand that most of us arent majoring in math. We are majoring in different things thinks he needs to slow down
3170,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH262,4.0,4.0,He's a professor that goes through deductive reasoning. He skips steps but if the class looks confused he will clarify. It is hard to keep track of his work on the board because he kinda writes over his own work. This class is proof heavy and they're always on tests/quizzes.
3171,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,3.0,3.0,"I did not really try in this class, which resulted in a B. If you try and study the book then you should be okay. He lets you have one make up test if you miss that day of class. He is kinda messy and does not erase the board completely (OCD problems if u know what i mean)."
3172,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH262,1.0,5.0,"He lectures too fast and he assume you know the step process. He just does problems after problems. His lecture is very unorganized, you cant follow him by steps. If you already know the material, take his class. Otherwise, you will be more productive and probably learn just as much staring at a wall."
3173,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH263,1.0,4.0,Too unorganized. He made things way harder than it should be. Hard to take notes from lecture. tests were different than hw and what he mentions in class.
3174,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH263,1.0,5.0,"Sure it's true that it'll benefit you to know some of the material before lecture, but for Yun, it feels like an excuse to do less prep for his lectures. He is not organized and that made his lectures hard to understand, on top of the fact that he made lots of mistakes. He's funny and all but he doesn't seem to have the heart in teaching."
3175,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,1.0,4.0,He really makes math complicated. really tough grade. !
3176,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,2.0,4.0,"the math is not hard but he makes it more complicated than it should be. he jumps topics/sections without saying anything so its always so confusing were we are. makes class leave late all the time and we missed one quiz because, quote ""im to lazy to grade"". Nice guy but even he has admitted that other professors probably teach better than he does"
3177,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,1.0,4.0,He's the first Math professor I strongly dislike. He's always late to class and dismisses us late. His strong accent makes it hard to understand him. He makes everything harder than it really is because of his specific grading style. He jumps  around topics too often and reviews previous course material more than  necessary.
3178,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,1.0,5.0,Don't take this class unless you already know all the math in 260 and just want to skip some lesson. His accent is terrible and always make the method to solve question more complicated.
3179,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,5.0,"His way of teaching makes it harder than what it really is the students at the math lab help you more oh yeah his accent makes it harder to understand , don't take him !!!!"
3180,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH105,5.0,4.0,Always gave two examples to help us understand the problems and solve them. Very easy class.
3181,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,1.0,5.0,This teacher was tough. He just didn't help me understand how to solve anything. I was struggling really bad so unfortunately I had to drop. I recommend another professor.
3182,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH270,4.0,3.0,Want an A? Read subject beforehand. He's a great professor but if you are going in blind into class he'll leave you in the dust. He does jump around a lot so it's hard to follow but if you look at the old exams and understand few key concepts you'll fly by
3183,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MA1153170,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Yun addresses at the beginning of class that; You must have already review/or have knowledge from the class before in order to be in his class that you are in now. It's ""usually"" a front to scare off the bad eggs and he will sometimes take a vote for some review (with a cost of course). Yun will stop what he's doing to help you understand."
3184,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH262,4.0,3.0,"Many students might not prefer Prof. Yun when taking calculus because they have a very shaky calculus basis from hs or math 261(this is a perspective of a math 262 freshman). The professor gives a chance to boost your grade, &amp; he doesn't expect you to remember, just derive/understand. His quizes are also short, and material on tests are covered."
3185,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH270,1.0,5.0,"If you want to destroy your Gpa, just take his class. If you wanna practice your listening, just take his class. If you wanna turn very easy questions to very hard, just take his class."
3186,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Yun's hybrid class for Spring. You only need the book for the homework questions. Math is my least favorite subject. However, I benefited greatly from Professor Yun's teaching. There are three tests which are about 10% each and, of course, the final which is around 20%. Professor Yun is also very lenient."
3187,1131705,Muyng,Yun,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,5.0,2.0,"Really good guy, he has his own methods for teaching math problems but they are very easy. As long as you follow the equations step by step, you will pass easily."
3189,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,1.0,4.0,"Professor is a joke.. Uses COVID19 as an excuse to be lazy and absent from his duties.. Did not teach for a second, not even a single zoom session. Uploaded old PDF's and vanished until after the exam. Seems to enjoy making condescending comments towards students when questions are asked. AVOID unless versed in Chem already."
3190,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,1.0,4.0,Worst professor ever! The class was online due to COVID and instead of posting lectures he would sporadically send out pages and pages of notes of difficult material for the students to teach to themselves. He was incredibly rude when anyone asked questions. And his tests were horrible - they comprise mostly of material not covered in the notes.
3191,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,4.0,"He calls himself an instructor and wants to hold the class to high standards. How can someone do that when they lack the necessary skill set to even teach the course? Completely unprofessional, poor work ethic, pathetic demeanor, and no respect for the sciences. Exert caution when selecting this clown that was trained by monkeys."
3192,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,4.0,4.0,"Late to every class. Extra practice problems you'll need to find on your own. Lectures are concise. Provides plenty of handouts and previous semesters exams. Gives extra credit quizzes. Answers questions as long as you ask and gives partial credit as long as you show work. Great teacher, but expect to put in work to keep up as he goes fast."
3193,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM102,4.0,3.0,"Took for him Chem101 and I got an A. However, for Chem102, I got a B, due to the ACS exam. He is a pretty nice professor and wants students aim high by transferring and graduating. He does understand peoples situations. His tests were pretty difficult, but he does give out worksheets that nobody really does, so do IT!"
3194,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,3.0,3.0,"I took professor for Chemistry 51 Lab portion only. The professor did miss a lot and was often late. Also, he would leave classroom and expected us to complete the lab on our own. He did answer our questions and was helpful when he was in class. I ended up dropping the course because I had a difficult time with two professors (lecture and lab)."
3195,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,4.0,2.0,He grades based on class average. Whatever the average is then thats a B. If you listen to his lectures then you will not need the book even though he lectures for a short period of time. (since he is late everyday)
3196,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,5.0,1.0,Professor Ghazarian is a great teacher. I enjoyed his lectures he really did help.
3197,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,1.0,3.0,Be aware. Very bad professor. He comes late to classes and often ignores your questions. You have to self teach yourself. His lectures are useless.
3198,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM102,1.0,5.0,Professor Ghazarian is the worst professor I've had in East Los Angeles College. Be prepared to read because he only use his book to have something nice at his office. By taking his class be prepare to be discriminated because he feel that he is the only person that knows chemistry. He used to boast about his Ph.D. Run while you can!
3199,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,1.0,4.0,"Deplorable instructor to say the least, does not uphold to the same standards he expects from students, stands in front of class waves around his marker and presumes he taught the class. And should you have any questions you can see him after class which you guessed it, never there. Save yourself and your GPA, embarrassment to the department."
3200,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM102,5.0,4.0,"I took his class Chem 65 &amp; 102. He is the greatest professor I have ever met. If you follow his lecture very carefully you dont even need to read the test book. He might take the whole lecture time for just one calculation problem, for students to understand the concept of calculation. Final is difficult. But He always gives you what you deserve."
3201,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,4.0,5.0,"The professor was good. He can sometimes be a bit, tough on us. He was absent never knew why, none our buisness. Yes, most of the things we had to learn ourselves but, he did gave us what to expect on tests. He can be a little intimidating by his strong personality but, he tries to reach out to his students. Dont expect him, to baby you. Just try."
3202,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM51,1.0,1.0,"He was a terrible professor.  Late to almost every class, midterm, everything.  Didn't really teach, you are pretty much on your own to learn."
3203,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,3.0,4.0,"Professor Ghazarian is a good professor, but you have to work really hard for a good grade! He was absent most of the time, I'm not sure why. He was an okay professor, but I mostly learned the material outside of class on YouTube."
3204,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,3.0,5.0,"One of the toughest subject I have taken by far.  He is constantly late to every class, doesn't explain or teach thoroughly to help prepare you for the exams that he personally creates for each semester.  If math is your weakness, you are guaranteed to fail his class.  Exams are NOT multiple choice.  All answers must be from your memorization."
3205,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,2.0,4.0,"Ghazarian was late to nearly every class, including test days and the final day. He was absent at least once every week as well. He can be rude and pretentious. Since he was absent and late so often, I found that we had to self-teach. Youtube videos were my savior. I don't recommend you take him if you are unable to self-study. No HW just tests/lab"
3206,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,1.0,3.0,"one of the worst professor i have ever taken, he is always late and doesn't show enough examples. The professor showed up 30 minutes late to our midterm, i had to leave the class. not recomendable at all."
3207,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM051,3.0,5.0,"Took him for winter, one of the hardest classes I've ever taken. Was late every single meeting, and disappears through out lecture. Good lectures but isn't really helpful. Didn't buy book, YouTube is your best friend. Gives practice test."
3208,1491049,Vahan,Ghazarian,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,1.0,3.0,Gazarian is not helpful at all. He doesn't dedicate himself to his students. During his class he goes and hides in his office. Where is the dean of the Chemistry department? Students do whatever they want to during the class session. Who hired this person to College. It is shame. I hesitate to call him professor.
3210,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,- Lots of reading and HW - Tough grader - No diversity in his reading assignments or lectures
3211,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,4.0,4.0,"Professor Rodriguez is straight up tough, he will make you work for your grade. The texts are very hard to interpret, however, he is willing to help you achieve the grade you desire if you simply RESPECTFULLY ask for assistance and guidance. Overall show up to the zoom lectures, REAd, ask questions, and if you need assistance speak up."
3212,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,5.0,4.0,"The people complaining need to grow the f up! This is a college class, shouldn't be expected to be easy. Rodriguez is an amazing professor, he makes you work for your grade and I definitely see myself growing academically by taking him. He is a very tough grader but I appreciate that, it shows he truly cares. He is really cool as an individual too!"
3213,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL102,1.0,4.0,"Im a student that doesnt procrastinate and makes sure to go onto canvas to not be backed up with work, but taking this course during the summer session was extremely difficult. He gave me a complete zero on an essay that i put work into and I thought was a B at best. I dont recommend him at all. I tried my best and always felt stressed. Awful."
3214,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,3.0,4.0,"I took this class based off of recommendations.I had initially loved his class. However, I grew to dislike his class as the online transition happened. He is not very accessible through email. You MUST read all the books. Could be understanding. TOUGH grader! I would've enjoyed his class if it was still in person. I improved in English but tough."
3215,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,please listen to this review as you are reading this do not waste your time I promise you you are going to regret taking this guy I am saving you all from a stressful time from this guy trust me this guy has issues throughout the semester and takes it all out on his students even if he is the only teacher available still don't take him
3216,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,1.0,5.0,If your a person who has a hard time with english do not waste your time taking this guy. He gives alot and his class is very stressfull do not waste your time.
3217,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL103,4.0,4.0,"Took in winter session with a lot of reading required back to back, stressful but don't regret taking in winter, just need to be wise with time management. Might seem difficult at first but very straight forward as long as you are keeping up with readings. Tests are open book which is good. Gives good feedback on assignments."
3218,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,4.0,Seems strict at first but is actually a great professor. Lots of essays and reading is a must. You can't get a good grade if you don't keep up with the material. You need to be able to manage your time and it'd mandatory to go to the reading center before you turn your essays in so you need your school ID. Would definitely take him again :)
3219,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,4.0,4.0,"English 102 was very difficult since I hadn't taken it for a few years. In total there were 4 papers, the last paper was 10 pages long. If you do not read you won't pass. He is very disciplined and expects people to follow instructions. A lot of taboo material."
3220,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL102,5.0,5.0,"If you really want a college experience, Rodriguez is it. Many people hate against him, but he is so f'n caring. He could tell I wasn't doing the reading and kindly asked if I needed the books. He loaned me any book I didn't have. No questions asked. No prof has ever done that. High standards, high care, great prof."
3221,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,4.0,4.0,"I absolutely loved his class, I only wish I had a lighter schedule. Do not take his class if you're filling your schedule up. There is tons of reading along with numerous literary analyses. To boot, he moves through the material very quickly. Great content and even better lecture but he assigns lots of work!"
3222,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,3.0,"By far one of the best professors I have had. Great lectures and reading assignments. Class was never boring. Participation is a must. You will be writing a lot, but the topics are interesting so you will be fine."
3223,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,4.0,4.0,"I have a love and hate relationship with this class, it a hard class but also easy at the same time. Your attendance is 50% of your grade, just don't miss any class day and read the books. His essay is decent, just follow the guideline he gave you and you will pass this class with at least a C with minimal effort."
3224,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,5.0,4.0,A great and caring professor. He pushes you to be better. You cannot 'slack off ' in his class tho...
3225,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH102,4.0,4.0,"He makes you work for your grade. If youre willing to put in the work then this class is for you. I got a 60% on the first quiz and a 70% on the first essay, but by the end of the term my grades changed to an A as I became more detail oriented due to his reading criteria. Great Class if youre trying to push yourself to new lengths."
3226,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG206,5.0,3.0,"I observed students spend more time complaining about the workload than doing the actual work. Yes, his class is challenging. But his level of teaching is unparalleled, mainly because he makes you critically think about what you're about to write. You actually learn with him. I feel more than ready for the University thanks to him."
3227,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,1.0,5.0,"I remember taking this class in 2015 because I was desperate and his class was the only one available while everyone else was full. This professor made us rent/buy a textbook, which I had to wait 4 days for it to deliver then tells us that he is going to change the textbook. Wasted my money taking this class because he taught nothing."
3228,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,4.0,"I definitely recommend him. He assigns a lot of work but only because hes preparing you for the transfer to UC/CSU. If you put in the work, he notices and is willing to work with you. He went above and beyond when I visited him during his office hours. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I've never met such a caring professor in my 2 years at ELAC"
3229,1745630,Joshua,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,He is very fair as he is trying to prepare his student if they decide to go to a 4 yr university. His books are bit difficult. attend all his classes and you will be good. If you don't do the reading the essays will be difficult. He is very clear on what he wants. I really enjoyed his class as he makes you think outside the box.
3230,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,1.0,5.0,One of the worst teachers I've ever had. If you take this class expect to learn 98% of the material on your own. Her lectures were awful. She just solves problems in front of you and expects you to understand. She does not keep up with grades. Don't take her unless a) you're already really good at math b) you like really difficult teachers
3231,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,1.0,4.0,"She starts off super slowly and then speeds up by a great amount as she realizes that she won't get through the material in a timely manner. She also wastes an hour of class by grading homework, when that could be done through an online service."
3232,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,5.0,"My first math class was with her and I'm a first year college student. She was so difficult and did not help at all. When we would ask for help she would get offended and answer in a sarcastic way. Do not recommend taking her, if your really good at math then you'll pass. I ended up dropping her class."
3233,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,1.0,4.0,Shes always serious and give off the vibe that she doesnt want to be there. She told me I was going to pass and that I shouldnt drop that class. Dont take this professor if you struggle with math.
3234,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH261,1.0,5.0,"Takes her time at the beginning of the term and then speeds up towards the end because she doesn't move at a fair pace all the way through. Quite honestly a waste of money to take this class if you don't already know calculus. First math class iv'e worried about passing because of her teaching style. steer clear,listen to her ratings on here chaps."
3235,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH261,2.0,5.0,"The beginning of the summer course was ok speed. But as the class progressed, she realized that her teaching progress is too slow and proceeds to rush through the rest of the class, not caring whether her class can keep up with the sudden change or not. Homework is graded by classmates, and can take up a whole class period of 3 hours to grade."
3236,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH261,1.0,4.0,"If given the opportunity, I would give a rating towards the negatives. Lectures dont line up with homework. Make a 180 if you see this professor teaching a class. If you arent good at math, don't consider this class by a long shot"
3237,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,1.0,3.0,Very dry and boring and presents without personality. The method of teaching is not helpful in the slightest as she does things without explanation and expects you to just know already even if the concept is barely being introduced.
3238,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,3.0,4.0,"I do not recommend taking her if you struggle with math. She doesn't know how to properly explain the questions you have. She does provide study guides for exams such as practice tests and they're usually spot on to what is on the exam, just different numbers. Homework everyday, but its beneficial. I recommend finding a study group."
3239,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH260,3.0,4.0,"Extremely non engaging professor but provides clear very dry explanations, without ever smiling. Very smart and knowledgeable."
3240,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,2.0,4.0,I highly recommend not to take her especially if math isn't your thing.  She's a tough grader and lectures are not explained well enough. She expects everyone to understand her lectures and when she helps a student out she makes one feel pressured.  Biggest regret taking her class.
3241,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,3.0,I wouldn't repeat this class because I feel we didn't receive the help we needed. Also this teacher had a unique way of teaching (kinda hard/odd to explain) and it didn't connect with me personally.
3242,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,1.0,4.0,It's a shame that I have come this far in the semester and feeling like I should have dropped the class sooner or changed my Professor. There are no lectures in this class. The teacher has good intentions for the students but I have not gotten taught anything. If you're ready too copy a bunch of notes with very little or poor explanations take her.
3243,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,1.0,5.0,"Worst Teacher I have ever had. She uses the same notes from 2001, just projects them up on the board and reads everything off to you in a very low, monotone voice. She doesn't explain, just reads it off. Thank god for the math lab &amp; Khan academy, otherwise, I would lose my A average. She seems to mean well but she should not be a teacher."
3244,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,5.0,She does not teach well at all! Tries to teach math off of a laptop almost a powerpoint
3245,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,2.0,4.0,"I think Nolan is a good well intention person. She really means to inspire, however her approach is not effective. If you are good at math, and can work independently you will be fine, as for myself I need a lecture, not just a screen. She will get you organized, and will give you effort credit. You really have to wait around if you need help."
3246,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,5.0,1.0,"She's a great professor and I'm sad she doesn't have a summer class for my 125. She spends extra hours at school to help whomever that needs help. Just do your homework, how up in class, correct your homework, exam, midterms cause that will count as effort. She will warn you when there's an exam or midterm."
3247,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH115,1.0,5.0,"THE WORST INSTRUCTOR EVER! I never thought i would be making a review for an instructor, but she is truly a VERY BAD instructor. Never helps, teaches WAY TOO FAST, always late &amp; to top it off always talking about her personal life. My high-school math teacher helped me more than she did, her lectures are unclear, i dont know how shes an instructor."
3248,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,125,1.0,5.0,"The worst math teacher in ELAC!!! She thinks the world consists of high lighters. She checks your binder and other un necessary material. She never wrote on the board, she already has everything written down on her slides. Her homework has nothing to do with her tests! Her tests are supper long and hard. She doesn't even give heads up prior testing"
3249,956175,Jeanine,Nolan,East Los Angeles College,Mathematics,MATH125,1.0,4.0,"Threw me out of class because I forget my homework on my desk at home. Offered to re do the whole thing during the in class work period and have it turned in before the end of the period. Luckily it was still during the week period where you can add and drop classes, so I got into another instead. I felt bad for the people left behind. Oh well"
3251,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,4.0,"I recently transferred from Elac, I took Prof. Solis back in Spring 2020 and I wish I can go back! Her lectures and in class discussion are fascinating, she makes you think and question a lot about reading and life in general. Although her course isnt an easy A, you will get so much from her class. I recommend everyone I know to take her."
3252,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,2.0,4.0,I consider myself to be a pretty good student and this class was a challenge. I found class boring and not helpful. I would never take another class with this professor because she is a tough grader and is not very clear with what she wants or the standards of her essays. The final was a 9-10 page research paper + an in class writing exam.
3253,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,1.0,3.0,"Professor Solis tends not to grade your assignments until couple weeks after, which tends to defeat the purpose of feedback since many assignments have since passed . Overall her communication lines are always open, although at times her response is quite bitter. She can be vague on some assignments and god forbid you email her with a question."
3254,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,3.0,"She's a true gem! Yes, there was a lot of reading, but then again, IT IS an english class. Just do the readings and participate. She makes lectures insightful. I felt frustrated in the beginning, but once I stopped complaining about the work mentally, I realized what a great professor she is. I highly recommend her!!"
3255,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,1.0,4.0,"Professor Solis was understanding and caring, but she is a tough grader. She bases the books off comic books which doesn't make sense when writing your papers. Her prompts are difficult to understand and so were the discussion questions. You do have to work hard for your grade, but if you have other classes don't bother taken her."
3256,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,1.0,5.0,"I took her online and I think shes way to hard of a grader. I did a 14 page essay, 7 page, 4 page and only missed 2 discussions and one assignment (there was A LOT) Definitly dont think I deserved that grade. A lot of reading and loks to books to buy over $150 If theirs other options go with the other option. For 1.5 month she didnt update grades"
3257,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG207,5.0,4.0,"Her lectures are amazing! The way she analyses the material is incredible. Reading and annotating is a must! She teaches students key factors in analyzing information by providing different points of views on the subjects being discussed, while also knowing how to recognize the hidden meanings behind the material being read. She is amazing! 10-10!"
3258,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,4.0,"Her way of teaching is much different from others since she does not use the typical english texts. Instead, she spices things up with some comic books, Dr. Seuss, the walking dead, etc. It is definitely not an easy class, but she makes her students think effectively. If the students do their job well, she is a great professor to work with."
3259,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,4.0,4.0,"Good profressor, talks about interesting current events and the readings are good, different than other teachers. Only thing is that she doesn't give much feed back and doesn't take the time explain your weakness and what to work on to make papers stronger. I don't think I would take again unless she was the only teacher available and adding."
3260,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,"Solis is such a great professor! She actually makes you think critically, she won't give you a grade she doesn't think you deserve. So if you want an A or B you actually have to work for it. She's tough and straight out but isn't disrespectful she just wants you to do your work. She means well and wishes the best for her students."
3261,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,2.0,5.0,"Professor Solis has ridiculously high expectations, she makes it seemingly impossible to receive a grade higher than a C for all class assignments. She assigns essays without details or explanations of what she expects. Do not take her class if you rely heavily on teacher assistance or need a lot of writing help."
3262,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,4.0,4.0,"Professor Solis is a very passionate teacher when it comes to english. Her class is a little tough so if you are trying to get that easy A, do not take her. She will help you think more critically and she does a lot of group work. she is intimidating at first but as the semester goes on she starts to soften up."
3263,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,2.0,3.0,too much group work!
3264,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG019,5.0,3.0,"She is a straight forward person wants things done asap and i like how even though she might not care about you, she wants you to think outside the box. She pushes you to do your best"
3265,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,4.0,4.0,"Good Professor.  Very straight forward, get the work done and you will do ok in her class.  Class participation is a must.  Must do the readings to understand what is happening in the class. Be ready to think outside the box use your critical thinking skills.  I would take her again."
3266,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH102,5.0,4.0,"Solis  helped improve my writing and critical thinking skills so much, I could never ever repay her. You have to work very hard, but I promise you it will be worth it. Most want the easy way out and thus, they never grow. The books she picks are amongst the most interesting I have ever read. Solis, I know you  read this. . . THANK YOU!!!!"
3267,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG127,5.0,3.0,"What can I say, she gave me an A. I was really surprised, not because I wouldn't do my job, but because I was late a couple of times and she gave me this whole life lesson. She likes to joke around and and tbh most of the times her jokes were lame. I would just laugh cuz I was already on her bad list Lol. She is cool just don't be late.!!!!"
3268,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH127,2.0,3.0,"Don't be late! Go by the back door or She will embarrass you in front of the class. This class is creative writing, so she graded much on participation and completeness. Find her hard to approach, and sometimes really mean and rude to students. Final is a 30,000 words portfolio. Not an easy class, but just try your best to write, you will pay back."
3269,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,E0698,2.0,4.0,"I wouldn't take her class ever again but thats just my opinion. All she cares about your grade and could care less about you, so if want a prof that you want to get along with then she's not the one."
3270,1014083,Alex,Solis,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,3.0,Professor Solis is a great professor. she is a tough grader but really cares about her students. if you really try and don't give up she won't give up on you either. not an easy A you really have to work for your grade. if you want to learn shes the professor for you.
3272,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY013,4.0,1.0,"Such an amazing professor, I loved her and her class. Her class was based on reading modules and 3 exams. The modules were short and the exams were about everything covered on the modules."
3273,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,3.0,"Canvas navigation, work assignments, and communications are well put together and easy to follow. Modules and assignments was well organized and due dates were fairly clear. I do not have any complaints."
3274,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY013,5.0,3.0,"Took her class over the summer as a high school student. Really nice, caring, and easy to talk to."
3275,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH01,5.0,4.0,I loved her class! She always wants the best for her students and cares about whether they feel welcomed or not. Quizzes are based on the notes and so are the exams they are easy if you study.
3276,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY101,5.0,3.0,I took her for Psychology 101 a few years back. She opened my eyes to a lot of solutions to world problems I hadn't even thought about. Her class is super engaging and amazing. I ended up taking many more classes with her. Learned so much. I wish I could take her classes again.
3277,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY013,5.0,3.0,"I took Social Psych with Dr. F , and it was such an incredible experience. I learned so much in her class, and really appreciate her dedication to educating. Dr. F goes beyond traditional lectures, and makes learning fun, interactive, and interesting. She has high expectations of her students, and provides opportunities to succeed in her class."
3278,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,3.0,I'm so glad I had Prof. F for this semester. Her lectures are great and she genuinely cares about all her students. A lot of extra credit opportunities and tests/quizzes/final are not cumulative. I learned so much in so little time. Would definitely recommend her!
3279,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,Such a wonderful professor! She truly knows her material. She also makes the class very intriguing. Easy class to pass however I highly recommend to not miss class because you'll miss a big chunk of information that will eventually be on a quiz or exam. Offers no homework. Plenty of extra credit. Exams and quizzes aren't cumulative.
3280,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY1,5.0,2.0,1 group presentation+EC. Tests+quizzes aren't cumulative. Be on time + take notes. You don't need the book. Easy pass if you're good at memorization. Absolutely no homework. She wastes time going on tangents sometimes but not that bad. She's very inspiring and pushes you to actually learn. Would highly recommend.
3281,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Festekjian sets the bar when it comes to teaching others. She is absolutely amazing, thorough, fair and so passionate with the way she lectures. I took her Psych 101 class and from there was hooked! I then took Social Psych, and finally Women Psych. She's a gem! Beautiful inside and out, she truly cares about her students."
3282,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY1,5.0,1.0,This professor actually cares about your grade she gives lots of extra credit opportunities and gives no homework . There are a couple of quizes and chapter test but if you attend class and cover the material its a piece of cake.
3283,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY013,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Festekjian is an amazing professor! She cares about her students and wants to you to succeed. You wont waste your time with her, just take her and you wont regret it! Her lectures are great and straight to the point, she wont make you waste your time focusing on things that arent important. I learned a lot with her and Im glad I took her!"
3284,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY013,5.0,3.0,"Dr. F is awesome. She really cares, reads your work and gives invaluable feedback. I wouldn't say easy A, but tests &amp; assignments are fair, lectures are great and there is extra credit so getting an excellent grade is possible. You definitely need the book. I can't recommend her enough. Take the class with her if you can!"
3285,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY013,5.0,3.0,The 5 week course flew by. The professor has a clear agenda. The class was interesting. The professor knows her stuff. I recommend you take her. She goes over the material and gives a clear outline that will help pass the exams. You must do your part and study. Good luck
3286,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH32,5.0,2.0,"She truly wishes for all of her students to succeed. Very open-minded and kind. Her class was ridiculously easy, but I actually cared about the material that I was learning-- and I learned a lot too! There was ONE group project, but if you're stuck with the work by yourself, make sure you tell her. She'll listen. I would definitely take her again!"
3287,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCHOLOGY13,5.0,1.0,"Professor Festekjian is a very sweet professor. She really cares about all her students &amp; takes the time to get to know us. Her lectures are very engaging and theirs never a dull moment. Their is classwork, alot of group work, 1 group project, and 3 tests. She gives study guides to prepare (mainly stuff on the PowerPoints). Loved her class."
3288,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH01,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've ever had. She really knows how to captivate the class and knows her stuff! Extremely clear on what she expects from you. print out her power point outlines that she provides, attend class, participate and you should have no problem in this class. Easy A if you actually try."
3289,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,3.0,BEST PSYCH TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL
3290,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY1,5.0,2.0,"By far the best teacher I've had taken here in ELAC, I did take her for summer session which was a bummer because class would be so interesting and go by fast. She genuinely cares for her students, her class is straight forward, she does tell you what to expect on a quiz and exams. There are no surprises.. definitely recommend her."
3291,1523077,Arpi,Festekjian,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH1,5.0,4.0,"Very good professor , knowledge and caring also attractive. Easily to get an A , bc you need to focus mostly on her handout also read book according to hand out , that's a lot of less work compare to whole textbook ."
3293,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,3.0,3.0,No extra credit
3294,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,2.0,3.0,"Took his night class.... bad idea. All he does is talk and talk, and rants about other random stuff. Don't get me wrong he is funny, but that doesn't make up for other stuff. He literally has to walk up to you in order to hear what you said. STAY AWAY lol"
3295,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,5.0,3.0,"Took English 28 with professor Butman. Don't let the other reviews keep you from experiencing this class. Although the reading isn't mandatory, it helps to do it. He provides guidelines on his expectations for the essays he assigns and will even give you extra time to turn it in. Take your own book to read in his class and you will be fine."
3296,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,E3487,4.0,4.0,"The first couple of papers he assigns are confusing. Throughout the course it gets easier. Good note taking skills are important as he explains what he expects from students. Lectures are confusing sometimes but it you take notes and ask questions it will be helpful. Very little homework is assigned, go to his office hrs. Great professor!"
3297,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,1.0,2.0,"If you want a lazy class and hope to pass, this is the teacher for you. You don't need to read, just show up to every class and turn in the work. There's only 6 essays, this including midterm and final. Don't expect to learn, challenge or know what is going on in class. If you ask him for help, you'll be more confused than before."
3298,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor yet. Hw and exam is a 400 word personal essay (informal). He reads everything directly out of the book with not explanation. He rambling a lot and gives unclear on essay assignment. He incapable of help you improve ur writing skill. he will noted when you received help even if you went to a tutor, he'll tell you not to do that again"
3299,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,2.5,3.0,"If I'd known of this site before registering &amp; reviews, wouldn't have taken his class &amp; have the regret. Only way to pass is if you tune everything out to hear him clearly since he mumbles &amp; he could explain an essay prompt w/o you realizing it. Only assigns 400 word paper vs the 1,000 criteria. Learned nothing since he genuinely does not teach."
3300,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,1.0,5.0,"while i was in his class he goes off topic, grades his students off english 121 and expect his students to know how to write a paper and does not guide his students on any assignments. Speaks very low he tries to be funny but personally i did not learn anything from this class i am retaking english 28."
3301,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,1.0,4.0,I have nothing negative to say about Mr. Butman. I tried the class out and did not comprehend with his way of teaching. So now i am retaking Eng. 28 with a differ Professor (SANGHA) and it is a dramatic change. I am learning the concept that needs to be met for this english class.
3302,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH28,1.0,5.0,So uninspiring. So boring. It was torture being in his class. He humiliated students whenever they asked a question. He offered absolutely no guidance. He speaks in a low soft voice and has major problems hearing. Avoid taking his class!
3303,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,1.0,5.0,"Mr Butman is probably the worst teacher ever, drop out before you regret it ."
3304,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH28,4.5,4.0,I have to disagree with most of the comments on here. I like his class and understand they way he teaches. He expects yo to put your time in your work. He goes over exactly what he grades on in class and gives examples. He does try to help students during class but at the end you get what you earn.
3305,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH28,3.5,4.0,I have read a lot of comments on here for Professor Butman and I have to disagree with most of them. I like his class and understand they way he teaches. He expects yo to put your time in your work. He goes over exactly what he grades on in class and gives examples. He does try to help students during class but at the end you get what you earn.
3306,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,28,2.5,4.0,"Butman is a very tough grader however, is very easy once you get the hang of the essays. Learn from mistakes !!!! First 2 essays were an F and a D. He explained mistakes not to make and once corrected i became a B student. Point is, don't let his attitude make you drop he actually does care about his students in his own way"
3307,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH28,1.0,5.0,Expects you to know everything. Difficult to understand and knows most of the class does not get it and still does not try to make us understand. If asked a question he will only repeat himself and make you look dumb. Horrible Prof.
3308,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH2,1.0,5.0,"HORRIBLE! His essays are so hard to get a good grade on, he doesn't teach all he does is read from the book and expect us to know how to write A+ essays. I dropped his class it wasn't even worth going to. I would never take him again."
3309,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,3495,1.0,5.0,very unhelpful very rough grader dont take his class
3310,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,1.0,5.0,"Don't take him!!!!!!! Boring, sarcastic, and a very tough grader. Class is only based on essays no book work."
3311,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,1.0,5.0,Take this teacher at your own risk!! Day 1: 35+ students Day of Final: 7 students total. his teaching doesnt make sense and he Laughs at his own jokes. His class is based on  eassays. Students dropped the class because they knew he wasn't going to pass anyone.
3312,296005,Ray,Butman,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLI3494,2.5,5.0,"The guy is funny ill give you that,but he already expects you to be almost perfect in GRAMMER.He calls his class ""grammar land"" fun right? His teaching method is horrible..The final was on a regret we have, I should have wrote about the regret i have for not dropping his class. Dont buy the fiction book only the Rules for writers(helpful)"
3314,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST12,3.0,2.0,We had to buy a book for the class that we never ended up using. She's consistently late every day by 15 minutes. Late with grading. Her lectures are nice but a bit boring at times. You can zone out for quite a while and not miss anything. No group project but will ask people to discuss. The final is an essay but it's pretty easy. Overall easy A.
3315,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,4.0,3.0,Professor Urrutia loves her history class so she explained it very well. The homework and the test are not hard at all if you read the book and the handouts papers.
3316,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST05,5.0,3.0,"She loves history and it shows. Assigned one book and a lot of articles. One assignment was to research our own native roots, which I had never looked into before. Opened my eyes!"
3317,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,5.0,2.0,"Cares a lot about history and about students. Office hours are helpful if you ever need help. She helped me revise my first exam. 3 exams and one paper, and she grades on improvement."
3318,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,1.0,3.0,"Was always at least 30 minutes late to class every time the class met, shes very knowledgeable with what shes talking about but gives too many opinions instead of the facts. Only good thing is that her study guides are clear. Unorganized &amp; takes forever to grade stuff so you really wont know what you have in her class. She's all over the place."
3319,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HISTORY011,5.0,2.0,"Very easygoing professor! VERY passionate, so her lectures are dense. Her material is not tough at all - lots of reading but it's all optional. Her study guides/slides have all you need to pass. Most of the grading comes from essays (on exam and papers). She is always available to help with essays, and has MANY makeup/extra credit options!"
3320,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,5.0,3.0,Professor Urrutia is fair and supportive. You will learn in this class. She wants you to know the real history of this country.
3321,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST005,5.0,2.0,Very encouraging and loves history. Sometimes does not return essays right away but she makes lots of comments and lets you fix and improve your work.
3322,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,5.0,1.0,She is passionate about history. She really understanding professor with your situation. She has an amazing lecture. Even without reading the book. She covered everything with her lecture. She also lent with grading the essay you turn in. She also reviews with you when it comes to midterm and final. She also opens arm when it comes to rough draft.
3323,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST005,5.0,4.0,Prof. Urrutia simply one of the best. A professor who truly cares for her students. She makes her lectures interesting and fun.
3324,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,5.0,3.0,Agree that she is passionate about history. She works extra with you if you go to office hours. Could have returned work faster but let you revise. She cares about students.
3325,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,3.0,3.0,Very inspirational teacher who is very passionate about history. I really enjoyed her lectures. However she was a bit late in giving back grades so that was a bit worrisome to me as someone who wants to make sure I am doing good in class.
3326,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST005,1.0,1.0,"Honestly, Professor Urrutia is a great person. Yet, she is very unorganized in everything including grading, being late to class, lecture being very vague, or going of topic, in test preparation, and responding to emails. There is no clear guidelines and agenda in the class which makes it harder on the students who want to receive A's."
3327,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS006,1.0,1.0,"She is very passionate about history, however her lectures are not really lectures. It's more conversational, and she speaks on random topics every week so it's not following a specific syllabus, which makes it confusing. Assignments take a long time to be graded, things are not posted online all the time if at all. Would not recommend."
3328,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,1.0,4.0,"Shes a nice person that cares about history, social justice, and education but she's late for every class, forgetful, doesn't keep up with grading, doesn't respond to emails, and expects a lot from the very few lengthy assignments/tests she does give. her lack of focus, organization and clarity makes the class frustrating for any student."
3329,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS012,5.0,2.0,Professor Urrutia is a great professor. She tends to be late very often even though her office was one floor above our classroom. Shes very understanding and flexible with due dates. Many times dates were pushed back and students still didnt have the work done and allowed them to still turn it in which is great. Genuinely cares. great professor!
3330,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST012,4.0,2.0,"She's is a very nice and chill professor. Lots of reading. She is very understanding , gives a lot of people time and extra credit to pass the class, so there is no excuses. She's available for all her students and helps them in any way to understand the content. Would most def, take again."
3331,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS012,1.0,5.0,"She is the most unorganized professor &amp; I have a 4.0 GPA. Everyday she was late to class, she didn't give the class a syllabus until November, didn't inform the class which chapter we were on, &amp; was behind uploading 11 Powerpoints until Dec. The main issue is that she didn't turn in my final to the Disable Student Program's office so I can take it."
3332,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,3.0,1.0,"Her class is pretty easy,and she has a tendency to push back due dates. This class should be an easy A as along as you do the work."
3333,613870,Lilian,Urrutia,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,1.0,2.0,I was reading the comments and reviews and the only thing I can say is that the negative reviews are spot on. The only to go about taking her class is to read the material yourself. She is passionate about her subject and she is not rude but that does not mean that you will learn and engage in her class.
3335,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEAL011,2.0,1.0,"Class is easy but what is up with him promoting and selling his textbook? Seems like he is there for a paycheck rather than to share his passion and he is really collecting a lot of money from the textbook revenue...$70 a book, 300 students, you do the math!"
3336,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEAL011,5.0,1.0,Probably one of the easiest classes you could take to have your health requirement taken care of. Honestly i had forgotten about the class for several weeks and i passed easily. You just have to buy his pricey book ($70) DO NOT BUY A USED BOOK. Timed tests on chapters. Took during Fall and was easy. No midterm or final!
3337,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH11,5.0,4.0,"I took his health class online this summer , I thought a $70 book was a bit pricey but totally worth it . Theres 5 projects from the book you need to turn in , dont buy a used book ! Quizzes are timed but doable ! All the answers are on the book , must read to pass them . He gives extra credit ! I got a B in his class !"
3338,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH011,5.0,2.0,"Took this class online. it took me 4 days to finish it all! 4 quizzes based on first unit of book (each chapter is 6-8 pages). Then another 4 quizzes are opened up a month later for unit 2. same thing. And then 5 ""projects"" that are worksheets from book. EASY projects. Literally one sided pages- those took me about 1 hour to complete and then mail."
3339,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEAL011,2.0,3.0,"Honestly its ridiculous that you have to purchase his own $70 book. Sends way too many emails my phone is constantly going off its distracting and annoying. The tests are timed, he does not give enough time even if you read the material and try to go back while taking the test. Overall the perfect word would be DISTRACTING. Too much going."
3340,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH011,5.0,3.0,"Need to read and study the text book, The text book has lots of great information , the drawings and diagrams made it easy to understand the materials . I enjoyed being in the class, Professor McBride gives lots of reminders when something is due, he answered all my email promptly"
3341,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEAL011,5.0,2.0,Easy class. 8 quizzes &amp; 5 easy projects that can be finished in a day. You need to buy the $70 new book because you need to turn in 5 worksheets so don't buy it used. The reading is simple so read the pages assigned before you take the quiz &amp; you should be fine. Three extra credit assignments are also available. Would definitely recommend this prof
3342,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH011,5.0,2.0,Easy A if you read the pages he ask to read for Quizzes. If you don't read and just take the test changes are you will score probably low. The quizzes are very simple and easy understand when reading the book. The book is mandatory and is $70 bucks because you will need it for a project that's worth a lot but its very easy. Would take his again :)
3343,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEAL011,4.0,2.0,Took for summer. Easy A. Downside is book is required which is 70 bucks because you rip some pages but its helpful for the quizzes since another down is they cant be found on quizlet. Nonetheless they are still pretty simple you just have to flip through the pages. 20 questions 30 minutes. He is well in reminding when things are due.
3344,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH11,5.0,3.0,"He is my first online professor I ever took. Honestly, hes the greatest! He instantly replies to your message and always giving feedbacks and answering questions. The book is required. Quizzes and test are based off the book, but super easy! Do everything before the due date, which he always emails you reminders. But overall, totally RECOMMEND!"
3345,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH011,5.0,2.0,"Excellent professor. Took him for Health 11 online and was able to finish all assignments in one day. He does give 5 Health introductory projects that MUST be mailed to him, so you have to buy the book. All quizzes are based on the reading, so you must read carefully. He does respond to emails."
3346,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEAL011,5.0,2.0,I took McBride in the summer and I actually learned a lot. Also was reminded of things I had already learned in the past. I learned as I read and did all his work online. I enjoyed doing the project he gave us at the end of the semester. The only way you won't pass is if you don't buy the book or do anything at all.
3347,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH011,4.0,1.0,"Super easy online class, we didn't even have a final. The tests were all multiple choice and basically open book. The only downside is that you are required to purchase his book, which was about $50. I probably will not use the book again and it is not resellable since you need to rip out a few pages for a class project. The class project was easy."
3348,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH11,5.0,2.0,"This is probably one of the easiest classes you will take in your life. Great information. The way professor McBride has it set up you can't go wrong, just do what you have to do.  Read!This was my first online class ever and it was awesome!"
3349,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEAL011,5.0,2.0,he makes you buy his book that he made. his lectures are very interesting relating subjects to real life cases so you remember it.
3350,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HLTH011,5.0,2.0,"If you're thinking about taking his health 11 class.. Take it! I took his class because it was a part of my general ed. Took it in the summer. It wasn't overwhelming , it didn't up my whole summer. the only thing is you have to buy his book NEW. but it was only 60 $ it wasn't too bad . and his 5 projects are so so easy I finished ALL 5 in 1 day!"
3351,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH011,5.0,3.0,"Do the work before the deadlines, he gives you more than sufficient time for this and sends deadline reminders. Don't pass on the extra credit, I'm sure you won't need it, but the extra points are good to have. His book is very interesting. Grading criteria is easy, if you don't understand it, something's wrong with you. TAKE HIM, he's great : )"
3352,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALT11,4.5,3.0,"Online Course and very Straight forward. It was not difficult, but you must perform and get assignments in on time. He wrote is own Textbook, and it's filled with practical Health knowledge. You can't buy a used book, because you must mail-in, (registered mail), the 1st assignment, only. He Co-Starred in small roles on LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE."
3353,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,HEALTH011,5.0,1.0,Great Professor! Follow all instructions and do your work you will get an A. Great course to take for UC credit. Only downside is that you have to buy the book new for about $65.
3354,224335,Dan,McBride,East Los Angeles College,Health Science,11,2.0,4.0,"Class based upon his book, which you must purchase &amp; cannot resell. You must rip out pages in the book to send to him in order to complete the course. Complete independent study. Complete projects. Online instructions are repeated multiple times in multiple ways, to the point of being confusing. Tests are pretty easy."
3356,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI007,2.0,4.0,Choose a diff prof. If there's no other option &amp; u need this class then get ready for long lectures. If u want to learn the material u will need to learn on your own by doing the readings and some side research. Towards the final he overwhelms u with hw. He isn't the worst prof in the world but can definitely show some improvement. Good luck
3357,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI7,5.0,5.0,He did assign a lot of reading and the class discussion papers were challenging. tbh I did the bare minimum &amp; skimmed reading and still got an A. Make sure to go to office hours for feedback on papers. I hate international relations and am not a leftist so it was boring for me but hey thats just me. Just do the work and participate youll be fine.
3358,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLIS007,2.0,3.0,"Professor Hernandez is not a difficult professor. JUST LAZY. He is just by far the worst professor I have ever had to learn from. Lectures heavy but chaotic, no critical thinking, ONLY REPEATS WHAT BOOK SAYS IN POWERPOINTS. Midterm&amp; final is a paper you have to wright based on 3 HEAVY readings and you can't use notes. (STUPID). he's super vague."
3359,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI007,3.0,4.0,LISTEN TO THE LECTURES. Nice person but a hard professor. He has his own grading system that nobody understands. I had a D going into the final but received an A at the end of the class. I was in constant fear of my grade. Go to his office hours and participate in class and he will grade easier on you. Always show up to class. Ask lots of questions
3360,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI07,5.0,3.0,"Insightful class. At first I was overwhelmed by the material because there was many readings. And I decided to not be intimated and just get the work done. Personally, I enjoyed the class and will recommend him to students who really want to learn the material in depth."
3361,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POL001,4.0,4.0,Fun class. Hes pretty left leaning and shows that in his lectures. Its also a lot of homework but I personally enjoyed his class
3362,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI007,2.0,5.0,"A difficult class for someone majoring in Poli Sci. Anyone looking for an easy and is not required to take this class do yourself a favor and don't enroll. Hernandez is a well informed teacher, but expects students to copy paragraphs of info while listening to him speak. Midterms and finals  no notes, no articles, prompts not easy. Good luck."
3363,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI007,5.0,4.0,The professor gives group quizzes and if you select teammates with a very low chance of reading and taking notes then you will receive low scores. For every assignment he gives he recommend students visit him during office hours. I went to every office hour he had. He is highly motivated in teaching students in class and helping students succeed.
3364,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI07,2.0,5.0,"Many heart attacks throughout the semester because I felt my grade was in constant danger. I never knew what I was getting. His scoring is outrageously rigid. Don't bother fighting for an extension or change. Unless you're knowledgeable in the subject, participation can be difficult. You really have to work for the grade. I did learn, though."
3365,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,01POLISCI,2.0,4.0,"Very passionate about Politics, and by Politics I mean left leaning, liberal politics. DO NOT try to engage in any civil conversation about politics with him, its all one sided and filled with Rhetoric and I feel he'll give you a harder time on your paper if you don't agree with his side of the story. Took class because I had to, WOULDN'T recommend"
3366,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLIS007,2.0,4.0,"The professor is straight forward on his guidelines and syllabus, but not so much when it comes to writing paper. He WILL NOT sympathize with any student as far as making exceptions or extending the assignment deadline. He is good at what he does, but he does not help students to succeed."
3367,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,E1194,4.0,2.0,"This professor likes to talk a lot, but that's what political science is about, right?  He's definitely passionate about what he does, and honestly I was ok with the class. would sometimes go on a tangent, but not as bad as other professors I've had before. Down to earth."
3368,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLSC1,3.0,4.0,"Straight up, do not take him unless you are a Poly Sci major. He is a cool Professor sometimes. His grading criteria for his midterm/finals is crazy. Good luck yo!"
3369,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,01POLISCI,1.0,4.0,"This professor is really boring. Yes, he has passion about politics but it's also very long and boring. His mid term and final are essays and he grades tough on those I got a d- for the midterm.  I wouldn't recommend this professor."
3370,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POL01,2.0,4.0,"Don't take this class unless you are really good at writing papers. Midterm, finals and extra credit are all papers. I got an A in English 101 and I have received poor grades in all my papers so far in this class. He took forever to even grade the 1st paper so I didn't know how tough he was until after the Midterm. Idk why he has good scores"
3371,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLIS7,3.0,4.0,He was okay. Not like other students say he truly is. He is a self motivated political science professor. prepare for  writing both midterm and final in advance.
3372,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POL01,4.0,4.0,This class was hard in general but I was able to go though it. He is really passionate about politics which makes the class fun overall. Learned a lot in this class.
3373,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI7,4.0,4.0,"Jeff is very dedicated to his profession &amp; is very good in politics, which is why his class can be a bit difficult as he requires difficult readings but not at all unbearable, his midterm &amp; final include an in class essay &amp; he gives 2 weeks in advance to prepare for and for finals a mock UN meeting which is really a great experience for anyone!"
3374,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,01POLISCI,4.5,2.0,"Honestly, taking this class in the Winter semester was tough. Five weeks of intense reading and note taking, the quizzes are online and you get 3 chances so that's helpful. However, for the Midterm and Final are descriptive essays that you will need to prepare for as you will have NO notes! So practice your essays, go to writing center/tutoring!"
3375,435250,Jeffrey,Hernandez,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI7,4.0,3.0,"You could definitely pass his class if you're not the brightest. The discussion readings he assigns are not much, however you must have very good academic terminology otherwise you will find yourself looking at a dictionary constantly, don't worry you're not the only one. The midterm &amp; final are straight forward. PRACTICE! Overall he's a solid prof"
3377,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM65,4.0,2.0,"For those who aren't confident in Chem, take his class. I took his class in a 4-week course and got an A on it. The workload is not a lot and his grading criteria are straight to the point. He is accessible outside of class and the test is based on the PowerPoint and only 25 questions, all multiple-choice. He's a cool professor! Take him"
3378,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM65,5.0,2.0,"Very nice professor. I can see his passion for teaching. Easy to understand, will always take his classes."
3379,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM211,3.0,3.0,"Lectures were clear, but you dont get to see your grade until the very end."
3380,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM102,5.0,4.0,"Khuu is a very understanding prof. With that being said, he always makes sure the entire class understands the concepts before continuing on with lecture. He takes the time to explain and always encourages students to ask questions. He DOES curve depending on the class grades which can be a lifesaver. I highly recommend him!"
3381,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,4.0,Loved his class. Took him in winter. I struggled keeping up with other chem profs because they moved too fast for me. Khuu takes his time to go through the material which was extremely helpful in actually learning and absorbing the info instead of rushing to write everything down. Will definitely take for future chem courses. Highly recommended!
3382,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CEM65,5.0,3.0,"I feel sorry for students who don't take his class. He is very clear on what he is teaching. He gave PPTs, he emphasizes the important parts of lecture so you are aware. He repeats important parts for students to memorize easily."
3383,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,5.0,2.0,BEST TEACHER EVER!
3384,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM221,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Khuu is one of the best professors at ELAC. Not only he cares about his students, his lectures are amazing! I'm taking his biochem class to prepare for the MCAT and it is the best $230 you would ever spend! His class reviews all concepts from Gchem to Ochem to Biochem, holistically! It's a must take class if you want to score high on MCAT!"
3385,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Khuu is my favorite chemistry professor at ELAC. I do recommend him but he doesn't teach that much anymore. :( I wish he could teach my o-chem. He is very nice, smart and funny. Do not hesitate to ask but he doesn't you give answer easily. Think more, ask more. He helps a lot without telling you the answer( that's amazing). He is very good at teaching."
3386,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM65,3.0,4.0,he is a good professor and really helpful but he is not easy at all by taking him does not guarantee you would pass the course. He is really strict when it comes to test
3387,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM211,5.0,3.0,Professor Khuu is amazing. He cares so much about his students and is willing to take time out of his busy schedule to help.  Very knowledgable man who makes lecture fun. I would definitely take his class again. The final is very very important. Do well on the final. It was a Christmas miracle but I got an A :')
3388,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHE65,3.5,4.0,I took this professor thinking this class would be a little easy but not even he is was tough and his test were difficult I would definitely recommend tutoring and a lot of dedication
3389,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Khuu is the best Chemistry professor. He is exremely knowledgeable, understanding,  and thoughtful instructor. Dr. Khuu makes subject very interesting. His lectures are clear. You will not get bored at all. He is very helpful, and is extremely honest with grading. Just study. I wish he would teach all chemistry classes from beginning to end."
3390,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM 065,5.0,2.0,I just want you to know that Dr. Khuu is the best Chemisty professor in whole world. Trust me. He is the most knowledgable professor I have ever had. If you have a question he will give you wonderful feedback. His lectures are very clear. If you read &amp; work  hard you will get an A. It was honor for my sister and me to be in his class. Thanks him.
3391,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,He is the best chem professor that I have ever had. I learned a lot from his class!
3392,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM211,5.0,3.0,"I took him for Chem 102 as well and love his style of teaching. His lectures are extremely interactive and allows the student to think whats going on behind the chemistry. He stresses fundamentals a lot as well. Three midterms and a final, nothing too special. Although his exams can be tricky; they require a lot of thought to ensure mastery. A++ "
3393,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM65,4.5,2.0,Great professor! Enjoy to take his lesson. It was so much fun! Easy A.
3394,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEMISTRY065,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Khuu really cares about the students' education and their success in the long run, therefore, he is tough on you but it helps prepare you for future science classes. His test for this class are purely multiple choice. They are not very difficult questions just as long as you know his material inside &amp; out. P.S. He is all about sig figs!"
3395,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM065,4.5,2.0,I took his class in BIO 3 which he was ok at. But taking him for Chem was better because he knew all the things and he was clear on what to know. He also gives good amounts of break.
3396,1148998,Alan,Khuu,East Los Angeles College,Chemistry,CHEM65,4.0,3.0,i thought khuu was kool
3398,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,1.0,"He's the reason I changed majors and I am now transferring as a Psych major. I wish he taught more psych classes. Traditional teaching from the textbook. He is very knowledgable and funny. He gives you personal experience as it relates to the subject. Need to show up to class, you will miss on a lot for one day. Do the extra credit he gives!"
3399,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,Best professor in my opinion. The class seemed so easy because he is such a good teacher. I felt so free to ask questions and throughout the course moved my seat to the front of the class. I definitely recommend him for psych 001!!
3400,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PHSY001,5.0,4.0,He inspired me to do my best not only in his class but also in life. He gives good life advice. Totally would take him for more classes. One of my favorite professors at ELAC
3401,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,5.0,"He's by far the best Professor I've ever had. He's down to earth, I didn't want to miss one minute of his class that's how interesting it was. He's actually pretty funny as well. Very professional, you won't regret taking his class. Study, take notes and you will be fine. He gives you the opportunity to approach him if your score are low."
3402,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH101,4.0,3.0,"He is a very good teacher. He made the subject very interesting, peppering in stories from his work in the field. Some of this is almost haunting. Take good notes. From those notes, study the book definitions. His tests are worded the same as the definitions in the margins of the textbook, along with some diagrams. I took it in the summer."
3403,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PHSY001,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I have EVER had, pinky swear. After a long day at work he had me looking forward to class. He doesnt read off the textbook he teaches (wow I know) he has be second guessing if maybe I should major in Psychology. Just pay attention and youll pass!! I miss his class already :("
3404,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,3.0,"Professor Stepanyan, is an amazing indiviso! He cares about his students and makes lecture interesting.

3405,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"Dr. S is a good professor. He goes over what you will need for the test in class, but you will need to read. Tests are based off of book definition. Gives a lot of extra credit opportunities. One group project and one paper. Gives great examples on subject and how he sees these areas in his field of work."
3406,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"He is one of the best professors I have ever had! His lectures are so interesting and inspiring. You can tell he is so passionate about his field. The class is pretty easy, everything on tests is covered in his lectures. Be sure to take good notes &amp; STUDY! No HW, just 1 short paper. Gives lots of opportunity for extra credit."
3407,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PHSY001,5.0,1.0,Amazing professor!!! Great personality and you learn so much. I would recommend everyone to pick him.
3408,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY001,5.0,2.0,"Dr. S can probably make anyone like psych! His lectures were always interesting b/c he included personal experiences. Super funny too! 2 quizzes and 2 tests (midterm/final). Only hw was 1 very short paper. Gave 2-3 opportunities for extra credit. Just take good notes, pay attention + read chapters and it'll be an easy A. Highly recommend!"
3409,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PHSY001,5.0,2.0,He isss super funnnnyy and makes the class so intriguing he relates the lectures to real life experiences/examples.

3411,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PHSY001,4.0,2.0,one of the best teachers i have ever taken . Makes you more conscious about life. Gives perfect examples. Makes you love psychology . Easy class if you show up everyday and pay attention.
3412,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY001,5.0,1.0,Took him summer 2018. Lots of extra cred! Dr. S explains things with real life examples and his own stories and experiences so he makes it really easy to understand certain concepts.

3413,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,1.0,"took this for summer 2018, one of the easiest and best class i have ever taken. class consists of two quizzes, one midterm, and one final. gives lot of extra credit. the homework is an informal 5 page essay. take him and you will pass."
3414,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"Dr. S is an extraordinary professor by all means. It is evident, from the nature of his lectures, that he is passionate about his work. His lectures are not only informational, but also inspirational and full of real-life examples.

3415,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYC001,5.0,1.0,This is the best class I have taken so far in college. The professor is amazing and really teaches in a way that makes students pay attention. His very funny and makes class fun every time. The only homework is to read the chapters on the textbook. All the exams are just vocabulary so make sure you study the words. I def recmm taking this class.
3416,1299046,Kevin,Stepanyan,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,5.0,2.0,"I love this professor! If he taught other psych classes, I would take his class in a heartbeat!

After taking this course this Fall 2014 Saturday Class that starts at6Am is not as challenging as it sounds. Yes, I went twice without any sleep and at no point did I get sleepy or tired from the lecture or video's we had to do journals for. I recommend Beaton JDC"

Ensure you understand charts, homework, labs, &amp; quizzes are all done online with McGraw hill connect. Quizzes &amp; Exams are timed. Exams are multiple choice &amp; Short answer. Proctored with google, multiple choice on exam are usually quizzes you took on Mc graw hill. Use your own words &amp; be ready to work. HARD!"
3441,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,BIO003,5.0,4.0,"Don't be too intimidated by Prof Canales - Bio003 is a LOT of material (some of it is tough) but she has a lot of tests and quizzes that help you make up a missed or failing assignment. TALK TO HER OUTSIDE OF CLASS, and STUDY and you will get an A. Her quizzes have most/all of the material on the tests, so keep tabs on your quiz material."
3442,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,BIO003,5.0,4.0,"Attend class, take notes, do study guides, and study some more, you will pass! Amazing Professor who knows what they are teaching. A true educator! You must attend every class, it moves fast and you will fall behind quickly. Gives extra credit on test. For lecture the majority of text is multiple choice. The study guides were helpful. STUDY"
3443,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSIOLOGY001,5.0,4.0,"Do not take this class in the summer! I have so much respect for Professor Canales. She can teach, but don't think that because its 5 wks that she lets you slack off on HW and quizes and exams. We started the semester sprinting. Her teaching materials involve, PP, whiteboard notes, and Mc Graw hill connect. You will be assigned a group ass."
3444,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. This is not an easy A class. If you want to really learn Physio take Prof. C. Would recommend to take advantage of office hours and to get started on the case study ASAP. Tests are 1/2 MC (quizzes &amp; HW) and 1/2 free response (she gives hints on what will come on the exams), offers EC. Final is heavy and cumulative, but manageable."
3445,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSI1,3.0,4.0,I wasn't too impressed the way she taught class. A lot of online quizzes and HW. Case study presentation is time consuming and I really don't see the point to them. Questions of the case studies are on the test but I could've just learned that on my own. Test are half MC and half written. Written portions long and tough so be prepared.
3446,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS01,5.0,4.0,"Her class can be hard but you know you will learn a lot. Lectures tend to be heavy and overwhelming. There is a group presentation which I suggest prepare as soon as you can, dont wait even a week ahead. She is willing to help out students as much as possible. This is not an easy A class, you have to really study and work for that grade."
3447,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,BIO003,2.0,4.0,"3 lecture tests, 4 lab quizzes, 2 finals (labcture). You really need to pay attention and take good notes for her tests. She is a cool professor, but her teaching is very detailed, the labs, lab reports, and lab final are easy, the lecture tests are detailed and are based off her lectures. Received One extra credit and some extra credit on tests"
3448,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,4.0,The best and tough professor I have ever had. She expects a lot of each student because she truly cares about your career goals. She gives a lot of work and a lot of reading. Her lectures are detailed but you have to read the book too. Her exams are right of lecture notes and things she has mention. This class was a lot of work but i love it.
3449,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,3.0,"Professor Canales is the best professor I have taken in college! Physiology is such a difficult and complicated subject but her lectures are very clear and you actually learn. She tells you exactly what will be on the exam and all you have to do is study. She takes attendance everyday, theres a group project, online quizes and lots of homework."
3450,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,BIO003,5.0,4.0,"One of the best professors I have had so far. She is very caring, gives good feedback, motivates you.

She understands that ppl have lives outside of class so shes very accommodating when it comes to assignments and exam rescheduling. As long as you keep up with the ciriculum youll be fine. Overall, shes a good professor and I would definitely take her again."
3455,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,3.5,4.0,She was a bit ridiculous in her policy and talks about her life a little bit too much. Nobody cares about your baby. She's a control freak and is anal about everything. But her lectures are clear and straighforward and she does prepare you for her tests well.
3456,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSI001,4.0,3.0,"I had Prof. Canales for Summer.Demanding workload, very specific, and overall rewarding.

3457,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,BIO003,5.0,4.0,"Challenging class, but being in college it's supposed to be, right? Missed a few classes which could be irritating, but teachers have lives too so it happens. She's helpful, clear. Things posted online (lectures, etc) but no biggie cause ALL my classes post info online. FYI: In this class you EARN your grade, it's not ""extra credit"" handed to you."
3458,968212,Nohelia,Canales,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSI001,3.0,4.0,"Physiology was a very tough class and it gave me a good kick in the butt.  She demands a lot out of her students.  You will be given a case study, which is group work (and a group grade).  The case study will require you to know normal physiology and pathophysiology, which is important esp. if you want to become a nurse.  I recommend her."
3460,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HISTORY11,1.0,5.0,"I wanted this give this professor the benefit of the doubt but his format to turn in homework is a fail. He completely takes forever to grade or is really strict on what you have to say in your readings after every chapter. Dont choose this professor for online teaching and Ive took a hard class before, this tops the cake. This is my experience."
3461,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS023,1.0,3.0,"I think his style works during normal times, but doesn't work online. His lesson plans were unclear and buried in a really long recorded Zoom that he uploaded where he kinda rambled for a long time, causing a lot of the class to turn in assignments incorrectly. He is also not consistent with what time he posts grades, but is very strict w deadlines"
3462,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS12,1.0,4.0,"He doesn't teach zoom at all and is not an understanding professor when you need something.

BE A GREAT NOTE TAKER if you don't take notes you won't pass. you must read MUST I'm not a strong reader but how he explains how to read it made it way easier.
3464,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST001,4.0,3.0,"Professor Ramirez's lectures are very engaging and easy to follow. Note-taking is a must for his class because the midterm and final are based on his lectures. The quizzes are usually based on the readings from the textbook, so if you read on time and take notes, the class should not be too difficult! I had a wonderful time."
3465,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,5.0,3.0,"He lectures a lot, but it's great! It's very easy to take notes, and if you have questions or comments he will help you understand. Just do the readings on the book, review your notes and you WILL PASS!"

There are 10 quizzes (100 points total), you cannot make them up nor the readings so you HAVE to show up! They are very easy as long as you go over your notes and read the chapters. He says he doesn't offer EC but he does lol"
3468,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,5.0,4.0,Professor Ramirez is a great professor. His lectures are always interesting and never boring. He makes history fun.
3469,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST12,5.0,3.0,He is great! His whole class he lectures on a chapter he assigned to read the night before. However he is one of those professors that intrigues you and actually makes learning fun. I absolutely hated history but he made after taking his class my perspective has shifted. Not an easy A but you can definitely earn one! (&amp; several opp. for EC)
3470,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,5.0,4.0,"Great professor that makes history interesting. 10 quizzes 100 points total (10x1) Primary source analysis, midterm in class essay, final 2 in class essays.

3471,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,4.0,5.0,"Professor Ramirez is a chill dude. He make his lectures entertaining and fun. You won't be sleepy in his class! But he's a fair and tough grader too. So, you also have to work your butt off to pass his class. Meaning, you have to read a chapter in advance before going into his class for you to take the quiz for 5 mins. Remember,you snooze you lose!"

He does have quizzes every week (that's what moved me from an A to a B), so make sure to read your book. Everything on his end though, is on point. I highly recommend him to anyone."
3474,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,4.0,5.0,Professor Ramirez is excellent. His lectures are very interesting and are fun to attend. He made learning history enjoyable. A downside is that he does have random quizzes every week as well as readings which really do affect your grade if you miss. So if you miss class more than two days your grade will be jeopardized. You will also fall behind.
3475,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,2.0,5.0,"there are 10 pop quizzes and are completely random. the quizzes are the first 5 mins of class and if youre more than 5 mins late you fail them, and they count for 100 points of your final grade! he is actually a really smart professor and lectures are very interesting and entertaining, but overall he is an extremely hard grader and would not rec"

3479,1667174,Carlos,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,5.0,3.0,"Loved Mr. Ramirez! Made history fun. He is passionate about teaching &amp; truly cares about his students. However, dont underestimate his grading because he is such a sweet person. He does not give away grades. That means, listen, take notes, &amp; be on time because pop quizzes are at the beginning of class. Midterm &amp; Final are in essay format."
3481,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL102,1.0,5.0,"I have to say he is the worst professor I have ever had so far. Super irresponsible in the winter session, was absent due to jury duty but never being helpful at all. He pretends to be helpful, gives you all the suggestions he can until he says ""your paper is good."" However, he turned out to give a super low grade."
3482,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,"He is the best professor for English 101, I will take him again."
3483,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL101,5.0,3.0,I took Mr. Centeno's class for English 101 honors and he overall was a great teacher! He assigned a lot of reading but had a lot a class discussions to further explain any confusion we had. The only thing I would say is that he did grade fairly hard on essays. Maybe because it was honors? He also took a long time to grade essays. Really nice guy :)
3484,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,5.0,He is a good professor and is available to you when you need him he also requires you to read make sure you do because he quizzes you on it.
3485,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL102,3.0,5.0,"He assumes that everyone is major in English and No matter how hard I worked on my paper, he still graded in a very disappointing way, which made me feel that talent is more important than hard work. Not all people in this country are native speakers, and we need time and encouragement. I thought he would be helpful, I guess I was wrong."
3486,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH103,5.0,4.0,"Professor Centeno is one of the best professors at ELAC periodt. He is hilarious which makes reading the material a lot more fun. He is extremely relatable and cares for his students outside of a class setting. Took him for English 103 Honors and the grading was a little difficult, but Centeno is there to help you with any questions you have."
3487,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,"Honestly, I loved this teacher!! He is everything you want in a teacher. He pushes you to be better, he understand where your coming from and he will check up on you to make sure your doing alright if you don't show up for class. Don't take him for granted because you wont find a lot of teachers like this, especially teachers you think are cool."
3488,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,5.0,3.0,"One of few professors that cares about student success. Gives lots of homework but, not too difficult. Very easy to pass, just participate and turn everything in on time."
3489,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH103,4.0,2.0,"He's a great professor! His class required a lot of reading and participation as a class. Do your drafts, see him during office hours to get feedback and you'll be ok. He will randomly give quizzes based on the readings."
3490,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,Professor Centeno is great! I enjoyed taking his classes. I took him for English 28 and 101. He's super chill and gives good feedback. A lot of reading and essays but he does encourage his students to go to the writing center and it helps a lot. He also does Group discussions and work but it isn't bad as it seems. TAKE HIM!
3491,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,3.0,4.0,"Good professor. This class does require a lot of reading. Be ready! Also, come prepared with your rough drafts. If you want an easy A, do not take him and also if you feel uncomfortable when speaking English. He likes participation and group work a LOT! One bad thing is that he takes along time to grade the essay's."
3492,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG028,5.0,4.0,Good professor and he cares about his students.
3493,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH28,4.0,5.0,"Hes awesome, you basically have to do your essays &amp; reading in order to pass his class."
3494,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,"He is by far the best professor at ELAC! He makes sure his students understand and process the knowledge he lectures. Hence, Centeno is dedicated to his job as an educator to help his students to be successful..."
3495,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,"He is the definition of a great professor. When I took him for English 28 and 101 it was a lot of work but as long as you do what he recommends such as going to writing center you will pass. It is mandatory to have the book! He also runs a club named ""Puente"" and it is really beneficial for those who are willing to succeed in their academic career."
3496,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL101,5.0,1.0,"Centeno is the BEST professor at ELAC. He made me believe in myself. He cares for his students as long as you show you are willing to put effort, he will notice and assist you. He definitely showed me how to write an essay. He is the best mentor. I suggest you make him your best friend because he will help you transfer if you get into his program."

AND GO TO THE WRITING CENTER AND OFFICE HOURS! IT WILL HELP ALOT #THEBEST #AWSOME"
3498,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,hes a great professor and goes above and beyond to make sure you do your best in English and writing compositions
3499,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,Centeno is amazing. He genuinely goes far beyond the expectation of a professor and an advisor. He gave me my first B on my paper!!! But only bc he wants us to improve our writing. His readings are amazing and provide insight to issues which are not typically addressed in politics or conversation in general. Ask questions &amp; talk to him. He's hip.
3500,1229887,Carlos,Centeno,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH21,5.0,2.0,Good professor cares abt students
3502,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,1.0,1.0,This professor is very unorganized. During the summer its a 5 weeks period and the 1st weeks was mostly about his life. Which means having to go at a quicker pace than the classroom already is. Also bad at notetaking just writes down one word and expects you to memorize everything when he himself does not go in depth of the topic.
3503,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST011,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ramos prepared me significantly for UCLA. He will speak the entire lecture and write down only key points. Not difficult on the grading, ask questions he's there to help! :)"
3504,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS12,4.5,2.0,He is not as bad a people said in the comments he actually provides good info. He has about 4 exams which are all writing on  his lectures had one fill in teast and one essay for homework. I recommend to take home during winter or summer he is more reasonable.
3505,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HISTORY11,2.0,4.0,He treats us as if he is a substitute teacher in a high school class and is super rude. He encourages discussion but when 3 or more people start chiming in and commenting he gets mad. His tests are fill in so you must read and highlight EVERYTHING. Thought you highlighted enough? GO BACK AND HIGHLIGHT AGAIN because the tests are super specific.
3506,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST001,3.0,3.0,"Actually, he's not that bad teacher at all. All you need to do is read the assigned readings he gives you, watch the movies he shows you on youtube and you'll be fine. His tests and finals are essays and you need to apply everything that you know based on those things and any other additional readings you've done. Recommend to do extra credit. "
3507,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST001,1.0,5.0,"First of all, this professor is VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. I asked for a course syllabus the first day of class since I didn't received one and he gave me the wrong class syllabus . He's very unorganized, doesn't give you the class topics for each week.  He's not clear,  specific nor even interested in answering questions."
3508,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HISTORY12,1.0,5.0,"I would not recommend him. He is not helpful at all. His lectures are long and boring, and his tests are not even about the lectures. Oh and he tries to make the students feel dumb. NOT what any professor should ever do. NO question is a dumb question, but that's how he will make you feel! "
3509,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HISTORY12,3.5,3.0,He's not terribly hard or bad. Just read the section he assigns and try to pay attention to his lecture as he takes material from both.
3510,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS11,1.0,5.0,Ok to be honest idk why i didnt drop this class before the deadline Anyways dont take him. He sucks at teaching lectures are bad hs writing is so sloppy. He has favortism with the guys. He makes you read the book and his tests are so confusing nothing to do with the book or lectures. I really regret takng this guy. Advice DONT TAKE him!!
3511,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,1.0,1.0,"This professor's teaching skills are horrible. His class is easy IF YOU READ THE BOOK. His lectures are always off track and he always writes ONE WORD on the board as he's giving lecture and underlines it as if it helps you. He makes you read 10 page or so essay ON HIS LIFE and then quiz you on it. It's just my opinion, I couldn't stand him."
3512,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST012,5.0,1.0,Great Professor Very Helpful Highly Recommend
3513,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST005,4.5,2.0,I TOOK MR. RAMOS' HISTORY 5 CLASS IN FALL OF 2012 AND I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM BEING A BAD TEACHER AT ALL. I ENJOYED HIS CLASS AND HIS CLASS IS EASY IF YOU STUDY THE BOOK ASSIGNED FOR THE CLASS. I AM REGISTERED TO TAKE ANOTHER HISTORY CLASS IN SPRING OF 2013.
3514,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST1899,5.0,5.0,I took his class in spring and he was not a bad tacher. His requirements to read the assigned chapters. He gives extra credit and is nice when you ask questions. He may talk a little bit of him self but to get an A or B you will need to study the book. He is good people i would retake his class if i could.
3515,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST11,3.5,2.0,"Everybody says that Ramos is a bad teacher. That is not true people! I took his class over the winter, and he is very easy. You need to get your head in the game and focus on all the notes and lectures in class, and reading the textbook is important if you want to get an A or B!!"
3516,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST12,1.0,4.0,"do yourself a favor: don't take this class. regardless of bad ratings and rumors, i decided to take him. his lectures are unorganized and unclear. keeps talking about himself. but he expects you to know EVERYTHING on the test. you must play by his rule, or else he won't like you, and it might affect on your grade."
3517,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST011,1.0,5.0,"Poor educator and speller, unstructured class and lesson plans, inconsistent grader. Often contradicts the book and gives his ""estimated"" dates. In his essay exams, he gives you a topic composed of 1-2 words and expects you to regurgitate everything from his notes in summary. Assignments are not clear, consistently fails to answer questions."
3518,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HISTO11,3.0,2.0,"Honestly, at 1st taking his class he seemed like a total pain in the butt &amp; rude. I was close to dropping his class. But as many students began to drop &amp; class got smaller it's like he turned into a calm &amp; funny teacher. Give him a chance, he's a good prof. just take LOTS of detailed notes as he's speaking. Exams are mostly essays but super easy!"
3519,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIS12,4.0,1.0,"Don't buy book. Other than that he is pretty easy if you pay attention to the lecture. Never look at the board because he will throw you off just write as he speaks, he's pretty slow and its a fairly easy class. and hes not as bad as some people think."
3520,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HISTO11,1.0,5.0,i think he is a horrible teacher that has no real explanation skills because he gets sidetracked with his own little fun stories and doesnt grade fairly...also his way of writing notes on the board is incredibly unclear because he only writes one word at a time and underlines it like it is important when everything is highlighted up there.
3521,528384,Claudio,Ramos,East Los Angeles College,History,HIST0224,2.0,2.0,"I wish I had taken this class with another teacher, now I have to repeat it. He talks about himself more than you want to know. I did not like his exams formats nor the fact that he is unfair and cold. Don't take him, he's not worth it!"

Be prepared to write your heart out. this course consists of reading, writing, and writing. (in that order) "
3527,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,HUMHONORS,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Oropesa was an extraordinary professor, who pushes his students to think  differently about some of the greatest writers in the middle ages and ancient Greece.

3528,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,HUMANITIES001,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Oropesa is a character and in a good way. He is very funny, and made Friday class easy to want to attend. I would recommend him to any student. The stuff I learned in his class will not be easily forgotten. If you get the chance to have him as a professor, you have lucked out my friends. "
3529,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,HUMANITIES1,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Oropesa makes you work for a good grade.  Short weekly quizzes on homework reading.  His final is a two part test that includes a take home essay.  He is funny. I recommend him, but you have to work hard.  "
3530,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,HUMAN001,3.0,3.0,For being a three hour class he makes it enjoyable ! Does assign a lot of work but it is an interesting class
3531,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENLGISH101,5.0,2.0,"The best English Professor I've had so far at Elac. He incorporated facinating subjects, such as religion, in the course. The class was really interesting and there was never a dull moment. He's also very funny and kind. Plenty of extra credit too. Take this class if you really want to learn about not just writing, but about the world in general!"
3532,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,5.0,4.0,"I've been going to college for the past 7yrs and no professor has made such a profound impact like Mr. Oropesa. He really is the best professor I've ever had. Do yourself a service and sign up for his class. Yes, he'll challenge you, but it'll be well worth it because you'll be better prepared for the UC level. Good luck :)"
3533,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,HUM60,5.0,3.0,Interesting and informative class
3534,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLI102,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher. 4 essays, get a C or below and he allows you to rewrite. In class quiz on all readings with a simple question. Fun but never lets you leave class early. Got an A."
3535,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG3532,4.5,3.0,I got an A in his class. His lectures were clear and very interesting. Very funny teacher will make you laugh from time to time. The books used in the class are challenging but he gives you techniques to break down the meaning of the chapters....Recommend him
3536,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLI102,1.5,5.0,"He is just the most stubborn and least comprehensive professor I have encountered so far here at Elac. At first, yes I agree he is a funny person but as you get to know his true colors he's harsh and RUDE! Don't recommend him at ALL!"
3537,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG102,4.0,5.0,"He is quite funny and thoughtful one. He is strict on grammar and Citation. He grades hard but allows you to rewrite once. He is quite the one I both love and hate. Although he doesn't take roll, you still need to go every classes because of homework and quizzes. Keep every papers for credits. Don't be late and better not go out when class in time"
3538,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,HUM60,5.0,3.0,"I love him! He is a wonderful professor. He doesn't make anyone feel dumb (even when they say ignorant things) and he teaches you in a way that allows you to think of the answer he wants without giving it to you. He is also very, very funny and nice. Professors like Mr. Oropesa are quite rare. Take him!"
3539,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,HUMAN1,4.0,4.0,he's hilarious!! he makes class fun. do the work and you'll be fine. take him!!
3540,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL103,2.0,5.0,"He's funny but honestly he made it impossible for most of the class to get an A, he found a million of reasons for not giving a good grade to papers. He's very demanding and picky grader good luck if you taking him, he will never be satisfy with ur paper OH YEAH if you're taking the 6-10pm class he will make sure you get out of class exactly at 10p"
3541,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG205,4.5,4.0,"great teacher! makes literature very engaging! h.w. is a must! miss 4 or more assignemnts he will drop you a whole letter grade.essays,midterm,&amp; final are very clear, he tells you what he wants to see and expects. LOTS of reading, don't fall behind &amp; he will keep you until the time class is supposed to end, you will almost never get out early."
3542,233814,Stanley,Oropesa,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG205,4.5,1.0,"He is a very good teacher! He has a weird voice but it doesn't matter. I totally recommend him! But beware he makes you do a paper on Paradise Lost, so get help if you need to :)"
3544,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO19,5.0,2.0,"Really chill professor, dont need to stress about this class too much, books are not required, recommend for your general requirements"
3545,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO19,5.0,1.0,he is so funny and cares about his profession. learned so much in such a little time. was never a dull moment in his class. would take again but sadly he only teaches 2 topics.
3546,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO08,4.0,2.0,Professor Gutierrez is a really funny caring professor. He makes the class room fun to be in and laid back. There is hardly any HW or test. If you show up daily and try you will recieve an A. Its really not a hard class i 100% reccomend this professor.
3547,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHIC008,5.0,3.0,Such a great professor ! Really recommend him his class is very interesting and he makes it enjoyable. Took him my first year and it was a great experience
3548,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO44,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor took him for summer. Very funny guy and doesnt require a lot of depth into reading. Highly recommended
3549,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO44,5.0,3.0,Took him for the summer. He was very cool. And everyday I learned something new!
3550,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHIC7,1.0,1.0,"If you're looking to ""learn"" from a man that doesn't care about his institution of work nor his students then this class is perfect for you. You will probably not learn much as he cancels class often &amp; lectures quite slowly. When he does decide to lecture he makes numerous offhanded remarks. Overall a joke course &amp; you should easily get an A."
3551,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHIC7,5.0,1.0,His very funny! Makes a lot of jokes! His very easy all you have to do is study the notes and you will do fine in his class.
3552,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO2,5.0,3.0,Professor G is hilarious he makes learning interesting a fun I took his class in the winter but I learned so much in such a short time
3553,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CH19,5.0,2.0,he is a very funny professor will make you laugh a lot and make the class interesting. I would take his class again just be ready to take notes and textbook isn't use in class but he gives some essay after your test to turn in towards the book sometimes... Its an easy A.. if you want a fun professor take this class.... :)
3554,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHI071,5.0,1.0,I would seriously take his class again. Funny professors really chill. He makes you buy the book but you wont need it just study your notes.
3555,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHI71,3.0,3.0,He is very funny but hardly shows up to class.
3556,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICA007,5.0,1.0,"He's a great teacher and also very funny. His lectures are power point and he makes learning fun. You must take notes in his class, so if you're absent make sure to ask someone for them."
3557,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO7,4.5,1.0,"I love Prof. Gutierrez! He's sooo funny, so it really makes the class easy to pay attention to. Sometimes when you ask questions, he'll answer with a funny joke &amp; won't really make the answer clear, but other than that, I would take him again! He's also VERY lenient!!! If you need humor in order to focus, like me, HE'S YOUR GUY."
3558,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO08,3.0,3.0,"He is funny and makes jokes during his lectures. Take notes, do the assignments, study the notes for test.  The only con is that he can miss more than 3 times a semester just because he wants to &amp; shows up late to class. That might work for some students but not for students that are paying tuition out their pocket. Overall, okay professor. "
3559,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO7,4.0,2.0,"He's dad joke funny.  So cheesy it keeps me interested.  Learning is easy when you're having fun paying attention.  It's one big story, take good notes, and make flash cards quizzing yourself on the questions he asks on his jeopardy game before tests.  Read the assigned book and enjoy. Ex. of joke: he's seen a 6 ft tall Rat in Florida. hint: Mickey"
3560,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,E0445,4.0,2.0,hes a good teacher. the class is usually never gets boring. there is not a lot of homework he gives. so in a nut shell its an easy A
3561,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO8,5.0,1.0,Hilarious! Don't miss class and take good notes. He gives study guides but its easier just to reread most of the notes. I felt he really emphasizes subjects so its pretty easy to remember things for the test. He gives extra credit through out the semester too so you can insure a good grade. Awesome professor!
3562,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CH08,2.0,3.0,"This class was a waste. I came everyday, took perfect notes. He is too busy making jokes he doesn't teach well. His tests are a lot more specific than his power points. Never gave homework. Talks bad about ELAC."
3563,414633,Gerardo,Gutierrez,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO19,5.0,1.0,"This class was super interesting, enjoyed taking his class. I would recommend him for Chicanos class 19. Half of his students dropped the class cause they were lazy to study! but I didn't study a lot and I still got an A... take him :)"
3565,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG103,1.0,5.0,He is a good person but the way he grades is really bad its either you get a 1 or no credit
3566,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,"Great Prof. i wish i could take him for Eng. 103 but it wont fit with my schedule. Not a tough grader, if you show that you have what he is looking for in the paper you get the point for it sounds pretty easy to me. If you don't get the point literally just go to him after class and he will tell you how to fix it. Free A"
3567,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,"As a non traditional student, coming back to school was a bit intimidating. However, after taking this class, I am back to feeling confident in myself from Mr. Younglbood's attentiveness and inspiring lectures. Professor is very considerate of students and grading can be a little difficult but time is given to improve your grade which is great!"
3568,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,3.0,4.0,"Hes a great, caring person, one who doesnt want you to fail, one who encourages a great deal for his students to ask questions, and hes hilarious. HOWEVER, if it werent for me already knowing the course i wouldnt have gotten an A. He doesnt teach much he just discusses the readings and shines a light on your mistakes on the essays review commas."
3569,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,3.0,5.0,To rewrite them but you definitely get unmotivated with how he grades . All we do for class is summarize previous readings so it can be a bit boring . He never misses and is always there on time. You can get discouraged by the middle of his class and want to give up . Im surprised I even passed this class but Im glad I did worked hard on my essay
3570,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,3.0,5.0,With all honesty if you take him you must be prepared for heavy lectures as in him talking about readings assigned the day before for homework. There isnt any quizzes or test except for one midterm and the final . For writing he has about 4 essays . The thing is he grades differently from other professors its either a 0 or 1 he gives you chances
3571,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,1.0,One of a kind teacher that you rarely encounter in your lifetime. He cares about his students and acknowledges their effort and devotion to his classes. I wish he could teach more courses.
3572,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,3.0,4.0,"He likes to get funny in class, but is more of a ""ima get personal"" type rather than professional. I didn't really improve my reading and writing skills and I didn't like this semester. I didn't really learn as much as I wanted (learned a lil). I did appreciate his feedback though! But it was not as helpful. Chill guy, but not a prof I would want."
3573,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,Youngblood gives his students plenty of opportunities to rewrite their essays. Just remember to visit his office hours and you wont regret taking his class. Btw hes very caring.
3574,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,2.0,4.0,"Had him for winter, he gave 4 long essays where his grading scale gives your essay just 1 point, he reads parts of the reading and brings up some things where he gets of topic most times. Brings up jokes now and then. Never take your time on any essay or it could pile up and also he gave rewriting of the previous essays as well."
3575,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,2.0,Youngblood is the awesome but is not really easy. If you try you will pass but it takes some effort to get an A. He makes you think and he cares a great deal for his students.
3576,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,3.0,4.0,"Tough grader, and difficult to pass. Gets off topic a lot when lecturing. Funny with a weird x-rated sense of humor. He can get boring at times when discussing book readings."
3577,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,3.0,Excellent service.
3578,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,1.0,3.0,"His lectures always go off on a tangent and he doesn't really explain what English 28 is about. His grading technique is not the best. For your essay, you either get a 0 or a 1, there is no in between and seeing that really discourages some people."
3579,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,1.0,5.0,"Youre graded on a few things. Those things being just written essays, that are only worth one point! Its difficult to get a passing grade in his class, but he is funny though and not boring to listen to."
3580,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH101,1.0,4.0,"He has a weird way of grading papers. He will give the option of redoing all essays, but it requires a lot of dedication."
3581,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,1.0,5.0,"Extremely hard. gave no extra credit, and failed every single exam just so we can rewrite it."
3582,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,4.0,"He is a tough grader but he does have a very reasonable re write policy. Most students hate his hard grading criteria BUT personally his judgement did make me learn. By doing this he showed me how I can improve. He does say a lot of sex related jokes, but does not say them directly to anyone. If these jokes offend you then yea.. dont sign up"
3583,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,1.0,"Youngblood keeps it real with everyone, he is about that hard life. sincerely, Gang Gang Blood"
3584,1241243,Cory,Youngblood,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,1.0,He is very honest in feedback and cuts you a lot of slack. His grading policy is great I turned in all my essays late and still received an A. He allows you to rewrite to still give you a chance to pass that essay. Make sure you go to office hours.

3599,1285194,Marina,Rodriguez,East Los Angeles College,English,READ25,4.0,2.0,"Basically homework and flashcards are based on Vocabulary Words which is pretty easy. The only hard part is keeping up with the flashcards. Each Chapter is 10 words and there were in total of 22 Chapters. 220 words in total to write and study. Other than that, class was fun.

3607,392072,Angelita,Rovero,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANO54,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rovero is such a good professor.

THIS WAS MY SECOND TIME TAKING ONE OF HER CLASSES. i MADE SURE I NEEDED THE COURSE AND WAS HAPPY TO ADD THE CLASS. TOO BAD SHE DOESN'T TEACH AJ CLASSES, YOU WILL LEARN THE MATERIAL. HER LECTURES ARE VERY INFORMATIVE AND MOTIVATING."

3615,392072,Angelita,Rovero,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHS2,5.0,1.0,"Her class was really interesting. She's very passionate about what she does, and she's really funny. She doesn't give quizzestests , just reflections including the midterm and final. All you have to do is take notes to help you out with the reflections, they're really not that hard. "

3620,392072,Angelita,Rovero,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANOSTUDIES,5.0,1.0,"I entered this class unknowledgeable about Chicanos when I completed, the professors passion and excitement for the subject lead me to sign up for another course with her, Professor is outstanding!!"
3621,392072,Angelita,Rovero,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHICANOSTUD2,5.0,1.0,"This teacher is easy, IF and ONLY if you attend regularly.

3625,392072,Angelita,Rovero,East Los Angeles College,Ethnic Studies,CHS47,4.5,1.0,"Mrs. Rovero is a great teacher who is very passionate about what she does, and her knowledge knows no boundaries since she gives helpful advice from career majors to actual history.

3628,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI19,5.0,3.0,Dr. Montiero is one of the best professors at ELAC. She knows her field very well and will make you know it. I recommend Prof. Montiero to anyone is a very independent student because Montiero is very active throughout the campus she does not always have time to meet with students. She is very passionate and true cares about her students.
3629,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLS1,1.0,5.0,"She uploaded the wrong HW and proceeded to lecture on an entirely different subject until an hour and a half into the class when she finally stopped and someone told her. She puts people to sleep with her lectures, and the ones who stay awake are just as confused. I would use words like: chaotic, rambler, oblivious, and confusing to describe her :("
3630,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI19,5.0,2.0,"This was my second semester with her. She had the energy, but later dies down in the half the semester her Syllabus for assignments and due dates for the test were spread thin although she was busy with other school-related issues revolving around the school and helping students to pass the class she very caring around those who know her well."
3631,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI002,5.0,4.0,She is a really great professor if you really want to learn. Her class wasnt easy but it wasnt impossible you just have to do your work &amp; study.
3632,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,4.0,3.0,"I took political science 01 online as a short term class. She gave lots of assignments back to back but with communication, she accepted late assignments. Although it was a lot of work she was very nice and I would take her again."
3633,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,2.0,3.0,"Took her for online during winter . She makes this easy class a little difficult because she isn't specific. She has her dates wrong, and if you need help she's not able to get back to you in a timely manner. You will need to read a lot but I enjoyed the material."
3634,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,4.0,3.0,I took political science 01 online with professor Monteiro. It was a short term class and although there were many assignments and quizzes through our the week the assignments &amp; quizzes were fairly easy. Any time I had a question shed reply with in the day &amp; I would recommend her to anyone looking for a poli sci class online.
3635,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,1.0,3.0,"Her assignment is confusing, and you may need a few days to hear her back. the good thing is her work is not hard but confused (which mean you may have hard to understand what she means before you start to the assignment) you have to pay $50 to get an ebook before the class and you will do most of the homework through the website."
3636,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,1.0,3.0,"her assignment is confusing, and you may need a few days to hear her back. but her work is not hard but confused which mean you may have hard to understand what she means before you start to the assignment."
3637,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLSCI2,3.0,4.0,"The book used for political science 2 is Shock Doctrine and Introduction alongside with the text. Strongly recommend to apply schock doctrine to the text and class notes, etc. The midterm will covers quiz questions, make sure study for them. Group project country for paper and presentation weights a lot. Make sure to do all extra credit."
3638,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI001,1.0,5.0,took her for a summer session; every time I emailed her she never contacted be back-so if you have questions about assignments you don't get any direction. I would never recommend her.
3639,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,3.0,2.0,"The class itself is easy. You MUST buy the textbook, her wording may make it seem like you dont have to. Her wording is hard to understand at times and sometimes you have to interpret how to do it by yourself. Sometimes unorganized. This makes it frustrating. If youre just looking for an easy class, this is it."
3640,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,4.0,2.0,"This is a great class to fulfill IGETC. Do the discussions and readings and you will definitely get an A. Totally recommend, no essays just a final exam and quizzes."
3641,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,5.0,3.0,"Monteiro is very good and clear during lectures making it easy to understand for all students regardless of their political beliefs. I would recommend her to any social science, political science, or undeclared major. Her assignments are too difficult you just need to keep up with readings and attend class AND ASK QUESTIONS! She is here to help!"
3642,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI002,5.0,3.0,Professo Monteiro has been by far my favorite professor here at ELAC. She is an amazing professor and gives students so much insight on the world and of course politics. Her PoliSci2 class is different from PoliSci1 in regards to assignments and papers but it is completely doable for any student to excel in. I will 110% recommend her!!!
3643,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLI001,1.0,3.0,very unorganized :(
3644,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI19,5.0,4.0,Professor Monteiro is extremely knowledgeable. All of the readings she assigns have a purpose and they definitely prepare you for university level courses. It is important to read and keep up with the CPAs that she assigns. As long as you read and ask for help you will be fine in her class.
3645,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLSCI1,5.0,4.0,"Professor Monteiro is poorly described by others on this website. She is clear from the beginning about the students' responsibilities in order to pass the class. Yes, it is a lot of reading but hey, WELCOME TO COLLEGE!! If you're lazy, good luck finding a professor who cares less about your education. Period!"
3646,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI092,5.0,4.0,"Be prepared to read A LOT! She usually assigns homework questions after every assigned reading, which can be tough at first. Her questions are not the usual ""the answer is in the text."" You really have to think about the question to give an answer she would like. I would recommend her to anyone interested in Political Science."
3647,1289965,Natalina,Monteiro,East Los Angeles College,Political Science,POLISCI001,1.0,5.0,"Since this is an online class, students get a lot problem, but the professor NEVER reply my email. So as my classmate. I don't know how would this online class work if the professor never give any help to her students."
3649,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,ANAT001,2.0,3.0,"Honestly, I wouldn't take her class again. She's a nice professor but she's very unorganized and uncoordinated. Especially since Covid happened and all classes have gone to remote online. I did not enjoy her class one bit. I don't think the students have to be chasing the professor to get answers to their questions."
3650,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,4.0,"Dr. kelley does not need any another reviews telling you she's great but, 1. She's great. She knows her stuff. 2. She is caring. While not obvious but you can tell she cares. 3. A lot of material but try your best. (I was in a group of smarties felt behind but still tried and passed) 4. Year at ELAC, she has been the best 5. Have a great summer!"
3651,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,1.0,5.0,Prof. Kelley is very nice but I been to her office hours and it didnt help me at all. Even though she curves and offers extra credit her exams are 200points each hahah so u do the math. I honestly think she should hav gone over major system but she didnt. She focus on muscles n bones instead of urinary and respiratory. So I feel like I missed out
3652,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS01,5.0,3.0,"This class requires student dedication. Record lectures 'cause although Prof. Kelley provides u w/Powerpoints, the examples she gives are EVERYTHING. She expects u to study the material. I heard a lot of ppl complain &amp; honestly, they were the ppl that didn't want to put in work. She gives lots of extra credit &amp; prepares u for nursing."
3653,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS01,5.0,4.0,"Kelley is one of the best professors I ever took. Physiology is a VERY DIFFICULT subject, so if you want to get a good grade, you need to spend times to read and understand the concept. Luckily, Kelley would offer you so many extra credits in every exam and class discussion, which make your grade pop up from C&gt;B or B&gt;A. Highly recommend this class!"
3654,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSIOLOGY01,1.0,5.0,HORRIBLE PROFESSOR!!! SHE IS NOT HELPING AT ALL
3655,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,3.0,5.0,Kelley is good Professor but she teaches very fast and expects you to know all the material. Tests are heavy and confusing.
3656,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHISI01,2.0,4.0,"Great professor. Took her during the fall and she change most of her exams, because a lot of students were coping. Her lectures are really good but she is a tough grader. She also has a Procter during finals. Youll learn for sure"
3657,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Kelley is by far the best professor I have had. Her lectures are very detailed and go hand in hand with her power-points. She speaks clearly, takes her time to thoroughly explain the material and always answers all questions. Her drawings of diagrams are very helpful. Makes sure you're learning. Fair grader. Highly recommend to take her class."
3658,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS1,5.0,3.0,"the best professor i had, especially for the hardest subject ive taken!"
3659,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHI001,5.0,3.0,One of the BEST professors at ELAC. She provides powerpoints for all her lectures and slowly goes through them. A lot of drawing in her class but it only helps you understand physiology that much better! You will definitely learn a lot in her class. She makes learning very enjoyable!
3660,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,4.0,"Professor Kelley is an amazing teacher. She will make sure you understand the criteria, and teach it in an applicable way for a better understanding. She drops your lowest lecture test. And gives extra credit quiz before every test. Study and do your best for everything, you should be fine. Her tests are hard but she's grades on a curve so it helps"
3661,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSIOLOGY01,5.0,3.0,"She is absolutely amazing! Her lectures are straightforward and her exams are based on her slides. They are multiple choice. Her lab was was also very helpful  and the lab exams were a little hard. We do need have a lab manual. Overall, taker her!"
3662,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,3.0,Dr. Kelley is amazing. Her lectures are practical &amp; applicable to the real world. Some physio prof at ELAC want you to learn the book and at the cell level. They don't have much  real world experience. Dr. Kelley teaches from an application perspective.  Other prof at ELAC should sit in her class so that they can use the same teaching styles.
3663,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,5.0,4.0,"I'm a 2nd year nursing student, and I can't thank Dr. Kelley enough for her compassion for teaching that gave me such a strong foundation in physiology! She is by far  the BEST professor (nursing school included) I've ever had.  Sweet, caring, answers ALL questions, patient, EXCELLENT teaching strategy, kind, funny, compassionate, the list goes on!"
3664,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS01,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Kelly is an amazing instructor, she will stop and re-explain herself if someon doesn't understand it. She answers every question with details. It's a tough subject so you must study otherwise her test will be confusing if you don't study!"
3665,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYS001,4.0,4.0,"It's a tough subject to teach, yet Dr. Kelley finds a way to provide some of the most interesting lectures.  Ask her any questions pertaining to the medical field and she is sure to answer them using both medical and layman's terms.  Lectures are very detailed and students are expected to understand the material as opposed to memorize terms"
3666,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSI001,5.0,5.0,"3 Lecture exams, but only counts the 2 highest scores. 3 Lab exams, Lab manual, and Final exam. No quizzes, no hw. I would say the lab exams were the hardest because it incorporated concepts from both lab and lecture. So it just felt like a more detailled lecture exam. Study hard and you will surely end up with the grade you deserve in this class."
3667,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHYSIOLOGY01,5.0,4.0,"She's AMAZING, Her tests are application questions but once you figure out how to study you will pass. She explains until you understand. I was struggling with a B until I figured out how to study. Her class was fast-paced so I recorded her lectures, studied very hard, and passed with an A. She also curves so that will help you! I enjoyed her class"
3668,979492,S.,Kelley,East Los Angeles College,Biology,PHISI01,4.5,4.0,"She's tough but good! She knows her stuff &amp; makes sure you understand the material. Be prepared with a recording device because she lectures super fast. No text book require, just the lab manual."
3669,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY82,1.0,3.0,"Dr. Taback knows her stuff, but she expects students to know information she has not covered in class. Grading is inconsistent."
3670,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSCH001,1.0,4.0,"She is one of those types of people whom you do NOT want to question. She also will shame you in front of the class, rather than speak with you one on one. She does have a lot of knowledge to share, don't get me wrong, but it's hard to deal with someone who has a superiority complex. You will encounter her during the CDC program, stay strong!"
3671,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY34,2.0,5.0,"This was the worse experience I've ever had with a Professor.  Dr. Taback is rude, condescending and thinks she knows it all.  I've never been disrespected by a professor before taking her class.  I was warned but several other students not to take her class and never challenge her opinion but never knew how she was.  Do not take this class"
3672,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH34,3.0,5.0,Her way or the highway

3674,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY14,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Taback is the type of professor that doesn't take ignorance.

Plus, she is very passionate in what she teaches, which nowadays, is a rarity."
3675,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY14,5.0,1.0,"Great lecturing skills; engaging and informational. She has a big heart for the mentally ill. Exams are not hard, just make sure you study and take good notes. You might pursue social work after taking this class!"
3676,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH1,2.0,2.0,She is very rude ! Nobody questions her since she runs the internship classes students need to graduate. She makes it very obvious when she dislikes students. She is very shaming in front of entire class . Has a terrible reputation among students for being a big B.
3677,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY1PSY14,5.0,2.0,"Dr.Taback is the best! She very good at the subject, very clear explanation during the lecture. if you put your efforts in, she will know it. If have any questions just talk to her, she will very happy to help the students unless you are really messed up. Theres not too much HWs but you have to do it mandatory, also with the attendance."
3678,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH34,1.0,2.0,She's boring and cuts students off if she doesn't like your question. She runs the chemical dependancy program so everyone is scared to cross her or you won't graduate.

She is very caring and kind, and makes sure her students remember the subjects, and I couldn't give enough praise. Grade depends on individual study plan, but in my semester NO ONE received a grade lower than a ""C"". Highly recommended."

3687,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY14,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Taback is a great proffesor, but is really rude with some people. Fairly easy class if you read, attend class, study powerpoints, and take good notes. Tests were multiple choice and somewhat easy. She likes to connect with her students, and tells great stories. She also requires class participation and reflective journals."
3688,285046,Karen,Taback,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH001,1.0,5.0,"She seems nice and all, but beware, she is a BIG LIAR! She practically runs the whole Department of Psychology and is very vindictive! I would stay away from her and Ms.Davey for they will do anything to break you!"
3690,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor... I was so scared to start my English classes but she made it so great. She makes you learn in a good way and the reading assignments are really good. Loved it
3691,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. She is available for chat often and gives specific and concise feedback on assignments. Shows that she cares by thoroughly reading and responding to assignments carefully. However, she is detail-oriented in her grading criteria, especially regarding essays. Class requires somewhat-heavy, but quite interesting reading material."
3692,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG101,4.0,4.0,"Clearly passionate about her subject. She will give you very specific, even nit picking feedback. But she does want to help your writing improve. Is lenient with workload and due dates, but don't slack off because there will be penalty points for missing the bare minimum. Believes in making the reading accessible aka cheap or free."
3693,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGL101,5.0,3.0,"I took her for ENGLISH 101 and she was so, so helpful. She will help out if needed. The class isn't hard. Just make sure to be on-time for all assignments. Points will be deducted if not. Will answer emails quickly and will try helping out as much as she can!"
3694,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,3.0,"SUCH A GREAT PROFESSOR!!!!! I took her for my first semester in college and i am so glad it got to be her. She gives great feedback and will help you!!! She actually cares about her students, I don't want to over react but in a way she will make the class seem like a famil with the great positivity and the great advice. She is so inspirational."
3695,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,3.0,THE BEST ENGLISH PROFESSOR! I am so so happy I had her for my first year at ELAC. Her positive energy makes me wish I have her for the rest of my English classes! English is my favorite subject but if it's difficult for you she will help you until you understand she also gives the best feedback &amp; some E.C! Take her &amp; you will never regret it!
3696,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,3.0,If you can get Ramirez go for it. she actually explains and makes sure everybody understands the material and super caring
3697,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,4.0,Awesome professor. Would recommend her. She makes class fun.
3698,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,1.0,This is the best teacher you can take. She is really helpful and actually works with you to become a better writer. Ask for help and she will give it to you. She also makes the class fun. This is was the first time i saw a class full the whole semester which shows how good she is. She is so passionate about what she does and wants everyone to pass.
3699,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,4.0,SHE IS AN AMAZING TEACHER! YOU WILL LEARN SOOOOO MUCH WITH HER!
3700,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,5.0,1.0,she is great. i highly suggest other to take her. She gives good advise and helps you with any questions you have. I would take her again.
3701,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,4.0,Ramirez is by far my favorite teacher. Her energy was always positive and made class fun! Lectures were always interesting. She does give lots of work but its not hard it's just enough to keep you on top of things. She's always open to go over your rough drafts before due dates and help you with whatever you need. Highly recommend her!
3702,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH28,5.0,4.0,Ramirez is such a good teacher. It is tough but by the end she makes you understand the concepts. If you're not so great in English then yes it will be a little hard but she's great.
3703,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG26,5.0,3.0,"Very inspiring. Missed a due date &amp; she allowed me an extension with only a small point deduction (still received a B). Was always accessible during office hours, and also accessible after school hours via email.  I assumed teachers just came to do a job, but Ramirez cares about her students. She wants us to do good. Would take over &amp; over again."
3704,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,4.5,3.0,"She is very outgoing, will make you participate in class whether you like it or not (not a bad thing).  Makes ENG interested, she is one of the best Teachers ELAC has, very interested in students success. Her class didn't feel like a class at all, she makes learning fun really. I would recommend to anyone who needs to take ENG. A lot of feedback."
3705,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENGLISH21,5.0,3.0,Ms. Ramirez is such an inspirational professor that loves to teach and is always filled with energy. She makes lectures so much fun time flies. She explains how she wants the essays and answers any questions you may have. The passages are very interesting to read.  TAKE HER!!
3706,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG21,4.0,4.0,She's very clear and helpful but can get a bit tough if u zone out even for a bit
3707,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,1.0,"Ms. Ramirez is a very good professor in East LA College. If you want to get A, you must take her!!!!!!!!! So much fun in her class. No tutor need, you can make appointments and go to her office to ask for help!!!! She is really helpful! I like her class very much. The lecture is easy. "
3708,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,E8532,4.5,4.0,Be interactive in class and you'll have a friend in the professor. She's great overall. She helped me write killer essays (:
3709,1008611,Nancy,Ramirez,East Los Angeles College,English,ENG28,5.0,3.0,"Very knowledgeable. Thanks to her I learned how to write a proper essay, and passed Eng 101 and Eng 103 with A's."
3711,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,WINTERCOM101,3.0,2.0,He is a very engaging professor. This class is honestly impossible to fail. He is absent a few times. I took him for winter and only did two speeches the whole time. No other assignments.
3712,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,1.0,3.0,"Haven't had this guy for a full semester and already I can tell he is no good! He's missed half the days since the beginning of the semester, in fact he missed the VERY. FIRST. DAY. Unorganized, leaves the room for such long periods of time, rambles on about nonsense and is not at all engaging because of it. Save your time, do not enroll!"
3713,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,1.0,1.0,"unprofessional, late, off-topic, delays assignments, tests, speeches, leaves class a lot. Spends too much time talking about seat chart, us participating rather than teaching, not funny. Doesn't finish sentences. No repetitive practice work. Recommend Philos: Logic in Practice before. You won't learn anything but easy pass. He just wants a check."
3714,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,4.0,2.0,"A take-home exam, some homework and a debate - that is all this class is. There are only a few things you need to know: Syllogisms, Toulmin Model of Argumentation, and Logical Fallacies. Prove that you know these concepts both in your work and in your debate, and you will pass."
3715,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,4.0,2.0,"Good professor, easy worksheet assignments that are due at the end of the semester. We did only one debate in class which isnt usually you and your partner against two other classmates and he lets you choose the topic which are mostly interesting. Would be late to class and miss quite a few times. Lectures were okay and book was used a few times."
3716,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,2.0,5.0,at first he talked about having debates at least 5 but we only did 2 he rushed us to do our final debate we only had 3 days he hardly arrives to class and if you asked him if you are having trouble he gets upset he expects you to know how to debate
3717,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,4.0,2.0,I felt he expects you to know the many different techniques of a debate (terms) almost no hw all semester but writing working on debate was done all week. Just do debates and youll b ok. No easy A here.
3718,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM101,5.0,4.0,"One of my few favorite professors at ELAC. He definitely likes it when students participate in class, and the more you raise your hand the more chances on getting a better grade you have. His lectures are super cool because he makes it feel like its just a casual conversation, but it allows you to open up your mind more. I really learned a lot."
3719,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COM101,1.0,5.0,He's really rude. talks too much about unnecessary things. misses class too much. doesn't help students at all. DO NOT TAKE HIM
3720,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM101,4.0,2.0,"He is a good teacher , not hard at all, showing up, doing the speeches is you need to do, easy to pass i repeat easy to pass"
3721,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COM101,5.0,4.0,"Group practicing was very helpful, he cares about his students and preps them before speeches . Make sure to be clear and speak up during your speeches, show up and be ready to participate (you'll be fine). Tip: try to make your audience laugh, this'll help you during your speech (helps control your breathing) and might help you boost your grade."
3722,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM101,2.0,5.0,Not caring students that much and grading mainly based on your clarity of word use; somewhat impatient
3723,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,5.0,1.0,I would recommend anyone to take this class. It will help you get more comfortable with giving speeches in front of your class. It's pretty much mandatory at this point which is a great way to expose you to that type of environment. Very beneficial.
3724,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,5.0,2.0,"Haddad is a wonderful professor. He's an intelligent person and he cares about his students. He's very chill and jokes around sometimes. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you find yourself doubtful about passing. You most likely aren't. Take the course serious, you'll learn a lot &amp; you'll pass. The debate topics are relevant and they are so fun!"
3725,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM101,4.0,2.0,"If you need to take comm 101. take it with him. He is good! He gives good feedback and educates in a refreshing style. He has made me a better public speaker for sure. Not much work other than outlines and knowing your speech whether it be persuasive or informative. Overall, he is a good choice and even has his own website! You won't be let down."
3726,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,1.0,3.0,He never helped us with the speech and randomly taught things that we don't need for our speeches. He always gave out hw to do and never collected them. He pushed forward the speeches like 3 times. I am worried for my grade right now because he has collected NOTHING. This is the Spring semester and past spring break. Still have not done any speech.
3727,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,4.0,3.0,Good Professor. Show up to class and do the work and you should be good. Be prepared to do speeches.
3728,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM104,4.0,2.0,Easy professor. Took him for two courses; comm 104 and comm 190 &amp; got an A in both courses. Just make sure you communicate with him and ask for details if you get lost. Don't be scared to approach him that's what defines the difference between an A student and a B student.
3729,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM101,2.0,4.0,This professor is absent too much and that causes you to run behind on assignments such as speeches. You are to know where to find your assignments in his page if not you will be lost. You are to be comfortable in speaking in front of class.
3730,1004743,Nader,Haddad,East Los Angeles College,Communication,COMM101,3.0,3.0,"He's absent a lot without notice, no email, and no announcement in the previous class meeting. Presentations are pushed back for weeks so you can better prepare yourself, just show up and participate in groups he assigns you in. If you're comfortable and relaxed with speaking in front of the class or a group then take his class. That's your grade."
3732,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,5.0,1.0,"This was by far my favorite class. She is a very intelligent and her lectures are very detailed. There is a lot of reading but it isn't a hard class. She doesn't make it easy but as long as you do the work, you will be fine. If you're a psychology major and want to actually learn the material, take Dr. Cleveland!"
3733,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,4.0,3.0,"I enjoyed taking psych 2, but I think it was a little hard since she only gives little time for a big amount of questions (ex. 50 questions w 60 mins) and I experienced a lot of stress taking the tests. I learned a lot and the class was invigorating since there's a lot of reading. I barely got a B in the class, but honestly it was not a bad class."
3734,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,5.0,3.0,Read noted she provides and videos. they will be helpful for exams. 4 Exams total that count largely on your grade. I slacked on first 2 exams got D's but passed my last 2 with C &amp; B. If you read material she provides take your own notes you will pass. Its a lot of reading but doable. If you plan on cheating you can't you must read to pass exams.
3735,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,5.0,2.0,"Very intelligent and articulate woman, also very relatable and pleasant to be around. I thought I was going to fail but she is extremely good at explaining the material. She gives study guides and practice tests so there is no reason why you can't pass this class. She wastes no time and the class passes by fast. I wish all professors were like her!"
3736,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PHSYC2,4.0,3.0,"If you have the chance to take Prof. Cleveland I highly recommend it! She is a very intelligent professor and cares about her students. As long as you take notes, study them and attend every class you should do well! Textbook is optional but very useful. She is also very hilarious and cool loved her class!"
3737,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY092,4.0,4.0,"Great professor if you dont have a passion for psych I dont recommend because she makes you WORK for your grade she prepared me for University I took her for research and biopsy and I learned A LOT in her class As a transfer student and I am ahead in my upper division classes you might not think youre doing well but do the work, and you will pass!"
3738,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH02,5.0,4.0,"Bio Psych was definitely a tedious subject to learn at times, but Prof Cleveland was a great instructor. NOTES are going to be your best friend, and only lectures on what you'll be tested on. She does offer extra credit and does look out for her student's needs. Overall, a great professor that I will be taking again next semester!"
3739,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY092,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cleveland is a real sweet and genuine person. Very interpersonal with her students and honestly one of the best professors I've taken at Elac. She provides study guides and many other resources you can use to study for the exams. If you complete the study guides and skim through the book, you will ace the tests."
3740,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,3.0,4.0,"Prof Cleveland seems like a dedicated, cheery, and sweet person but she made bio-psych so boring, it made me want to switch majors because I lost my interest in it. The subject overall is tedious but I feel like her way of teaching it isn't the best. I felt like she would get distracted easily and ramble on a lot and her notes were redundant."
3741,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY92,5.0,4.0,"She's very enthusiastic with her teaching which I enjoyed. It may all seem overwhelming at times, but she constantly assures you that you'll be okay in the end (she was right). My only advice? Take notes diligently."
3742,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY92,5.0,4.0,Oh my gosh never skip class. Take good notes. Make friends with everyone around you. Talk to them. Could not have done it without them. The experiment we did was fun &amp; she provides pwrpoints &amp; study guides on canvas. She helps a lot &amp; gives resources on how to write your 10 page APA style paper. Ask questions! Study! Thank you Dr. Cleveland!!! FAVE
3743,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH02,2.0,4.0,"I took psychology 2 with her, to be honest, her class is really boring. This is not an easy A class, she gives pop quizzes so you have to study. Besides that, you have to be on time because she will take roll, and you cannot use your phone during class. I think she is a nice person but her class is not that interesting."
3744,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,5.0,3.0,Dr. Cleveland is the best. She stayed late at school to help me with some personal problems. Thank you for caring about me. (: You and your class helped me so much. I was able to make a good grade. I switched to psychology as a major because of her.
3745,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH02,1.0,3.0,"If you are a psych major, probably you chose this major for the desire of helping people to overcome their struggles, but not for this professor. She makes your major choice to fail in perspective due to her lack of tolerance and flexibility. If you dont need her tolerance and understanding, its an easy class, otherwise take someone else."
3746,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,5.0,4.0,Take her course! I did online and was very pleased with the structure. She is attentive and will email you quickly if you have any concerns. 1st test is the hardest but you can do it! Modules are clear and go over test topics. A very straightforward class that is easy to pass if you apply yourself.
3747,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,5.0,3.0,"I took her bio psych winter course and she was amazing. Shes very passionate about what she teaches and she has a super bubbly personality so her lectures were never a drag. Since the winter course obviously means a shorter semester, we didnt get to cover everything which kept the class pretty simple for the most part. I would definitey recommed."
3748,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH02,5.0,2.0,"Just took Dr. Cleveland over this winter session for psych2. Definitely need to be in this class for all days since its 4 days a week about 3hrs a day. Alot of material to go over; pop quizzes on material she lectures on, as well as videos she has on canvas. First test is the hardest, she said the average is 70, i got lower but managed an A."
3749,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSYCH002,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Cleveland is the best there is at ELAC her classes are tough but she prepares her students more than enough for the quizzes. However, if you miss frequently you are bound to fail. I'm willing to pass on a future class if I can't enroll in one of her classes. She's simply the best!"
3750,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY001,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Cleveland is one of the best at ELAC she provides study guides for upcoming test, plus her lectures are very interesting and easy to understand !! I recommend her 10/10"
3751,1377733,Cathy,Cleveland,East Los Angeles College,Psychology,PSY001,4.0,4.0,Great professor! Her awesome personality makes the lectures so much fun! Beware of pop quizzes.
3752,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCTG001,1.0,4.0,3 hr lectures will bore you so badly that you'll self teach yourself and she cannot even explain the simple financial accounting concepts to students at all. Very strict and not lenient at all.
3753,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACC1,1.0,4.0,"Horrible teacher, does not know how to explain even simple concepts. Hard to understand her horrible monotonous foreign accent."
3754,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACC1,2.0,3.0,"The class had one 3 hour lecture a week. Very boring class and all the information is in the book. The teacher has a monotone voice and there is little class participation to keep you awake. She is strict and inflexible when it comes to assignments, opening up online assignments early and any discussion. Might be an accountant thing."
3755,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT01,3.0,4.0,"This professor is very strict! Her intro e-mail WILL let you know of what to expect, do not take it lightly. A deadline is a deadline, and there are no exceptions to anything. You must learn the material in order to pass, the final is COMPREHENSIVE not multi-choice. Very rigorous subject as it is, so be prepared to work for your grade!"
3756,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACC1,3.0,3.0,"I am currently taking her online class in summer. TBH she is pretty good but I only attended to like 4 of the lecture she did. Test and homework is online but the final is in class, so those who wants to take a online class, be sure to be ready for the final in class, because I am not ready DX"
3757,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCOU1,5.0,4.0,Forever yeung is a great professor who prepared students to learn and fully comprehend the material . This professor expresses her wisdom and experience to better  the student for future  accounting which allows the student to learn the material thoroughly
3758,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACC1,1.0,5.0,"teacher very difficult to understand , doesn't give out study guide for better preparation for tests . would not recommend at all"
3759,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCOUNTING001,4.0,3.0,"I took her in the winter semester and it began easy. However, she rushed a chapter 2 weeks/half before the last day. We nearly had a test + ton of hw a day. She is a really good instructor and will help you. I understood what she taught and I askd for help from friends in the class. She uses cengage and etudes. All in all, i got a B and i like her."
3760,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCOUNTING002,3.0,4.0,A lot of work but you will definitely learn. She might seem strict  and scary but she's very nice once you get to know her. Subject matter itself is difficult but she would point out there's a lot of help that you could get like tutoring etc. a lot of extra credit too
3761,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACC1,3.5,4.0,"Book is a must have to pass! I Would not take for an easy grade. There are Sunday morning lectures for extra credit (optional). You can use a cheat sheet for final(double sided), 1 project(group optional), and HW and Test are due every week. Keep all Tests, and Illustrative problem notes for review and you'll pass with a good grade. I got an A."
3762,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT1,4.0,1.0,"She is an exceptional professor.  The best accounting teacher ever! She has a very strong personality, but is very passionate about accounting and cares about the students. You really have to work in this class, I guarantee you will LEARN in her class.  I got an A. Also, i would recommend you form study groups. Take her you won't regret it. "
3763,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT1,3.5,4.0,"Currently taking her online, I pre-read before class started  because its a lot of informationI currently have an A, but i haven't taken the final YET. Homework, test, and lectures are long/hard, there are Sunday 2 hr lectures sometimes. I  would say she's a hard teacher. I'm an accounting major. Do not take her for an easy grade you have to work!"
3764,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACC1,2.0,4.0,Took this class online and she was hard! Did not pass! I completed all homework and test and still did not pass! Test have nothing to do with the lecture. When you ask her questions she is very rude and intimidates you. Good LUCK!
3765,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT01,1.5,5.0,She is usually really rude when students try to ask questions. Does not explain things well and has strong accent that makes it even harder to understand her. She doesnt really teachexplain as just expects you to understand everything just by reading the book. She rushes through the material and most in class were really struggling to catch up.
3766,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCOUNTING,2.0,4.0,She is sometimes funny when she lectures us and her accent makes it funny too. She gives a lot of homeworkonline homework. She moves very fast so you would need a tutor just to stay on track. You better do all the homework and extra credit just to pass
3767,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT002,5.0,4.0,"She is an exceptional teacher.  If you want an easy grade, DON'T take her.  You actually learn in her class and she makes you WORK.  Some students may not like her because she has low tolerance for those just trying to get by, playing on their phones, etc. She can &amp; will embarrass you in class if you are disrespectful to her in this way.

3768,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCTG1,2.0,5.0,"Has an accent which makes it difficult to understand her sometimes. Frequently very impatient and rude with people who ask questions. She's always late 10-15 minutes before class and frequently, randomly leaves during class and has an assistant teach. Does not really explain things very well  which hurts you as intro accounting can be complicated."
3769,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT1,1.0,4.0,"She is rude when you ask questions. Snaps at you, I think unintentionally, but does intent matter? She never did to me, but I watched and saw not to ask her questions.  Her explanation of things is very poor and hard to understand. You really end up teaching yourself from reading the textbook. She made us come in on weekends, but was always late.  "
3770,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT1,4.0,4.0,I know many people complain about her but she is a very good professor. Remember this is college not high school. If you do all the extra credit you should get a good grade even if your tests aren't the best. If your major is accounting (like me) I highly recommend her. Personally didn't like her but academically she is good!
3771,307510,Isabel,Yeung,East Los Angeles College,Accounting,ACCT1,4.0,2.0,"I took Professor Yeung class during summer 2014 online. I think her class is easy. You need to read and study for this class. Its accounting. Do the hw, attend class and DO ALL EXTRA WORK! The extra credit will help you grade  A LOT. You can fail your final and still pass with a A if you do all the extra credit. She gives many extra credit."
3773,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,3.0,Professor Firat is a good Professor. He gave me a lot of good ideas to do my projects. He is open every time to any question that you have. I definitely would take a class with him if I have a chance. I really like the class
3774,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,3.0,The professor is a real gem.
3775,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,4.0,"For this course, it is as real as it gets. If you are serious about starting a business, then Prof. Firat is your professor. You will get to write a real world business plan and he will help you out with his constructive feedback. He won't just expect you to write and not point you in the right direction."
3776,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,4.0,"Professor Firat helped us apply the material and research necessary to develop our business plans. His approach is very effective. I completed a business plan prior to this course, but I was nowhere as intentional or thorough he has helped us to be. You will have a perfectly written business plan if you do the work and listen! So do it ! Worth it!"
3777,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,2.0,2.0,"Cryptic wording, repetitive, excessive overlap between projects. Assignments are understood but seem to avoid simple/direct wording to add fluff. Professor is helpful and available... but the class set up needs work. Theres a lot of work that needs to be done for the final business plan - due to repetition &amp; lack of structure at the beginning."
3778,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,4.0,"Even though this class will challenge you, the professor made sure you had everything you needed to complete every assignment minus the job specific research. Great professor especially through this pandemic."
3779,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,4.0,That was such an amazing class. I loved the professor and learned so many things about business from him. A lot of papers to write but all in order to help organize your business plan. Thank you Professor!
3780,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,2.0,"Really good lectures, great professor"
3781,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,3.0,Professor Firat is an excellent teachers who wants to see all his students succeed. He provides us with all resources we need to complete assignments.
3782,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG2309,5.0,4.0,Great Professor! Hes a very knowledgeable person. You will learn a lot from him and this class. I would definitely recommend him.
3783,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BMGT1327,5.0,3.0,Awesome!
3784,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BMGT1327,4.0,3.0,"He is willing to answer your questions and during the lectures gives great examples so you understand the material better. There are online reading and quizzes every week, so you have to make sure you figure out any technical issues. However, if you run into any issues throughout the course, he is open to help you out."
3785,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG1307,5.0,2.0,"you will be learning from a real Businessman, he knows his stuff. I will take again."
3786,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG1307,5.0,3.0,Best teacher! totally reccomend him. He teaches very good and you really learn in his class.
3787,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BMGT1327,5.0,3.0,Professor Firat is an awesome professor.
3788,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG1307,5.0,1.0,Excellent teacher! can't wait to enroll in his other classes.
3789,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG1301,4.0,3.0,"Telling the truth it is one of my favorite classes, the class was so interesting. I'd recommend it 100%, the book we took under this class(if you want to check) is Entrepreneurial Small Business 5th edition Katz, and access to McGraw Hill Connect is mandatory for this class(the only downside for this course), but otherwise you will learn a lot."
3790,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BMGT1327,5.0,2.0,"It was an easy class, i'm glad that i choose him.,"
3791,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG1307,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor, He is involved in his roll as a professor and he offers the best of him. I am planning of taking another class with him."
3792,1328969,Ibrahim,Firat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Business Administration,BUSG1307,5.0,2.0,"It was a pleasure to be apart of this instructor's class. No surprises, he followed through on everything planned from the beginning to the end of the semester in all course work. I took his second start class and was able to learn a lot in the small time given. This instructor was very informative and knowledgeable of all aspects of the course."
3794,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,2.0,"I am one of those students that sucks at math but came to realize that if I practiced I could grasp the concepts better. I took this class over the summer and I only attended one lecture. Professor Gomez posted the recordings for later viewing. EASY A if you complete your mathlab hw, 4 tests and 1 final which was 40% of grade but only 12 questions."
3795,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC1325,5.0,4.0,We started this class Face to Face. Attendance was mandatory. There is a quiz at the beginning of every class. 4 exams and 1 Final. If you follow his lectures and do the work you will succeed. There were a lot of negative comments about him here but I really enjoyed his class. I respect his style of teaching. I highly recommend him!
3796,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,3.0,For those saying he is hard you guys aren't prepared for school. He is one of the very few professors that can actually teach. He gives us quizzes beginning of each class and after he does a review of what we learned previous. He can teach very well. i look forward to his class everyday. COME TO CLASS
3797,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,4.0,4.0,"Quiz before class that goes over last weeks material. 5 tests and then the final which is comprehensive. He made reviews, but not for every test and didn't post them online which he did for previous years. He is accessible outside of class and will help you. Just show up, pay attention, answer his questions and you'll pass."
3798,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,4.0,I admire his style of teaching. I was nervous about this class but he explains the content thoroughly. The workload is significant but it helps your average in the long run. There are quizzes &amp; homework practically everyday. 6 exams. If you access his previous content through the learning web youll be fine. Final review was EXACTLY like final.
3799,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,1.0,"Makes math super easy, you get a quiz at the start of every class so be prepared to review the last class' material, try not to skip class. He gives out exam reviews which is the same as the actual exam so easy A. It's like getting taught math by a mad man but he makes it extremely easy, NEVER use your phone during lectures, he's very sassy."
3800,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,1.0,5.0,I took Professor Gomez online class and he was AWFUL!! I sent so many emails to him that went completely unanswered. Not responsive to online students WHATSOEVER!!!! Stay away from this man!
3801,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,1.0,5.0,"His style of teaching was alright. But I didn't like his overall attitude, he would curse and say things like 'I don't give a rats a$$' how you do in my class. It was weird, I made a B in the class, but it was TOUGH WORK! Many students failed the class."
3802,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,1.0,5.0,Pop quizzes every single class. I ended up passing (barely). Wouldn't recommend this professor.
3803,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,1.0,5.0,Professor Gomez is extremely rude to his students. I didn't enjoy his monotone lectures or his teaching style whatsoever. He is by far one of the worst professors I've had at HCC.
3804,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,1.0,5.0,"If you struggle with math in the slightest please do NOT take this man! He is extremely rude to his students. Tells students that he doesn't care how they do, that he already has his tenure. He also uses profanity and cusses during class. Pop quizzes every single class. STAY AWAY FROM HIM!"
3805,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,4.0,3.0,"His class is very easy if you show up and look over your notes at least once. He is a very good, straightforward teacher. He doesn't hand out A's, but it is not hard to get. We have quizzes every day in this class, but he drops the lowest 4. If you miss a class, you fall way too far behind to catch up without extra help. Perfect amount of homework."
3806,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,3.0,If anyone takes his class &amp;doesn't pass it means that u were never mean to learn math in ur life. This professor explains in a way that anyone can understand. He explains as if u are a child. To fail his class requires one to be extremely dense. He is not kind or caring but his job is to teach and he is great at that. I suck @math &amp; still got an A.
3807,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,2.0,"Really straight forward professor, very good teaching skills. Be careful with your phone don't let him catch you using it or you done for the day. But overall really good professor I 100% recommend him, very good teaching skills, I never knew that math was that easy with him."
3808,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0000,5.0,3.0,"I took Gomez for Intermediate algebra. Clear speaker, good handwriting, answers questions, gives partial credit, gives good feedback. He came in everyday with a list of techniques to teach and some problems to run through, then we got out at least 20 min early every day. MyMathLab for homework. 4 tests and a final. Absolutely no phones aloud."
3809,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,4.0,3.0,Professor Gomez is able to explain Trig. A little tempered but he is just doing his job. Just try to show up to every class and you will be fine. STUDY hard because there are quizzes every class period. Most of the chapters are easy but it gets a little tougher. I go to the math lab for extra help. No phones allowed or he will kick you out.
3810,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,5.0,3.0,"Let me begin by saying that math is not one of my strong subjects. However, Mr. Gomez is an awesome professor and now I actually enjoy working Trigonometry problems. Contrary to other professors that just hand you an A and move you on, Professor Gomez really makes sure that you understand the material so that you can succeed in advanced courses."
3811,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,4.0,4.0,I liked Professor Gomez. He was clear on the course outline and stuck to it. If you miss class you will fail as there are quizzes each class. There is a lot of online homework for this class that you need a code for. He explains everything very clearly and wanted his students to pass. JUST KEEP YOUR PHONES OFF and you will be fine.
3812,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,1.0,3.0,"There is a quiz everyday which isn't too bad but he's very strict and unhelpful. He's also really rude and unpleasant to be around. If you work through the mymathlab assignments, you should do fine. He's still a really bad professor and a really bad person."
3813,2448,Pete,Gomez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,TRIG1316,2.0,2.0,"Your work has to be done his way or you fail. Even if you get the same answer, its wrong."
3815,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"go-ahead to take him, essay class fo having easy A"
3816,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,2.0,"I took Professor Pearson for SOCI and we started in class but because of COVID, we ended online. I was actually really sad when we went all online because I really enjoyed his class. I'm not sure if I would call them lectures because he made it so fun and interesting. Even though we switched to online, he still made it fun and clear to pass."
3817,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,2.0,"Even though i'm a Conservative and my ideology is quite different from his liberal view, his class is still inspiring and interesting. I have actually learned a lot from this class. The tests are straight from his lecture and videos. The essay is only about yourself so it's very pleasing to do the papers. Easy A if you take notes and study!"
3818,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI1301,5.0,1.0,One of the best teachers Ive ever had.
3819,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,3.0,2.0,"do hw online( buy code access), get 10 extra credits for the whole grade. exam based on video and what he talks in class. talk too much about his personal life, too hard to keep concentrate on his story. more than half of class sleepy since he talks or watch video during 3hours. slowly reply email, and not support."
3820,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"Very chill professor, makes requirements clear and the tests actually contain what he teaches! Not a lot of material and not difficult at all."
3821,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,3.0,You need professor Pearson's class in your life
3822,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,he is the best professor i have had in my life! spiritual!!! caring !!!!
3823,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher for an A!! 2 exams, paper, and final count twice. Entertaining lectures and discussions that open the mind to thinking. Review sheets are given for exams, and he goes over it before the exam. Have an open mind and write down notes. This class won't interfere with harder classes."
3824,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pearson is intelligent, hilarious, and open-minded. He shares a lot of personal stories which create a level of trust with the professor. Even his ramblings helped me understand the material more in depth. There is no real homework, but there is three test and one paper."
3825,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,2.0,"Listen up! &amp; Take notes. He has amazing lectures, sometimes a little sidetracked but as long as you pay attention you'll be fine. No need to get a textbook. Took his class in person."
3826,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,4.0,2.0,"Sociology is a great subject in itself but Pearson has an eccentric approach that keeps you interested. This class is interactive &amp; you need to take notes. He does go off track at times but you won't get bored. Don't buy the textbook. Overall, thoroughly enjoyed this class. Definitely recommend unless you get easily offended. Pearson can be savage"
3827,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI1301,4.0,3.0,He really interesting and funny on his own way.
3828,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,4.0,2.0,"He's interesting in his own way and connecting sociology to his life. He does get a bit sidetracked but the notes are posted online. 2 exams and final that counts twice, 1 paper. Easy A if you study a bit, his exams are based off on his notes for the most part and little bit from textbook."
3829,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"He's very good at what he teaches, and he tells very compelling life stories that relates to the lectures. His tests aren't very hard and there are only two, excluding the final. There is one essay, but if you like sociology it will be fun."
3830,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,4.0,2.0,"He was a decent professor. Not a usual sociology class though, not sure that I learned much about sociology. I did get something from the class, he has a very interesting perspective of life and ways of living and it is interesting to come to class and listen to, although he does get side tracked and talks about himself too much. Not hard overall!"
3831,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,1.0,3.0,"Talks way too much sure its fun hearing the stories, but I spent more time in class listening about his personal issues over the actual material hence why taking notes, and looking over them on your own time is required. Grading system is really dumb, and argues with you for having an opposing viewpoint towards his."
3832,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI1301,3.5,3.0,"Pearson is a really good guy and very easy going. He does, however, get off topic and talk about his personal life a little too much. LOTS of notes to study and some of it isn't even on the tests, which was frustrating. I didn't use the book at all, just be sure you go to class because he writes the notes down for you to copy."
3833,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI2301,4.5,1.0,"it is not only a class, it is TED talk show. enjoy every second of it!"
3834,337055,Anthony,Pearson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,2.0,Pearson is a wizard! What is this sorcery!
3836,899396,Desmond,Lewis,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,Best professor Ive had so far
3837,899396,Desmond,Lewis,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Lewis is the best. I read and wrote more this semester than I have ever done in my life, but I learned. I wish I could take him again. Great teacher!!!"

3841,899396,Desmond,Lewis,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,INRW0420,5.0,2.0,"Everyone calls him Mr Beautiful because thats his middle name, just joking.

3857,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,2.0,5.0,"He sucks. Yeah, he gives extra credit, but the test aren't like reviews."
3858,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,2.0,Mr. Litong is a great teacher. He is very nice and friendly. He makes sure no one is ever left out of the loop and his teaching methods WORK. Would take his class again in a heartbeat !! :)
3859,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,3.0,Mr. Litong is a very nice teacher. He is very concerned about his students. Will take his class again :)
3860,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,2.0,5.0,"This professor has good intentions, but if you fail your exams you will not pass this class at all because this professor only counts 3 tests and the final in your overall grade, he doesn't include homework in the overall grade but only replaces an exam grade, so my advice is to pick anyone else if you are not a strong test taker"
3861,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,4.0,3.0,"Even though the class was online, you can tell the professor gave an effort to bridge the gap. He does give extra credit for answering certain math problems throughout the course and is open for discussion about our work. The class consisted of 3 exams and a comprehensive final. He does give reviews and most of the work is done through My Lab."
3862,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"Mr. litong is the worst that I have experienced he never teaches he uses a powerpoint with notes, like how is that going to show us how solve problems"
3863,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,3.0,"Professor Litong is absolutely one of the best professors of HCC. He is always patient, even you ask a question he has just covered. He encourages everyone to ask the question in the class. Extra credit in all the tests. Four quizze and one final. HW replaces the lowest quiz. Take him if you really want to learn and prepare for your future study."
3864,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"What is this guy like seriously, he only goes over homework problems and thats it, he doesnt teach doesnt make things clear doesnt care if you fail and it just felt like that he doesnt want to show how to solve a problem"
3865,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"AWFUL!!! I HATED THE PROFESSOR AND THE HOMEWORK AND THE TEST, IT WAS EXPERIENCE FROM HELL!!!!"
3866,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"I dropped his Cal 1 class after 2 weeks, there is not enough time to cover all the material and learn it! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS DURING THE SUMMER! this was a horrible experience!"
3867,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALGEB1314,3.0,5.0,"I took this class during the summer and it had to be my most stressful month of summer it was ALOT of math , but he does provide enough extra credit to help your test grades out .. almost 75 Sections of hw for the entire 4 weeks each having ALOT of questions and videos ... If your willing to do all the work he puts up you will pass but it is alot!!"
3868,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"This teacher never take him i spent so much time studying on youtube the textbook seemed easy. like wow right? such tough papers. he doesnt know we are humans we forget what we studied back in college algebra or even elementary school but he expects to know. if you want to take him, you would need to run. always hw hw! Proves one part only, then HW"
3869,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,I dropped the second week from his class because he is bad at teaching and nothing from whatever he teaches is on the test
3870,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,Guys trust me and never take this teacher at all I suffered to get the B by studying by myself
3871,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,I got an A but with a lot of hard work and study bymyself this professor is just therefor the money hecant teach right and he only goes over some homework without teaching the subject. Most of the students dropped and nevertalked to themath department about him but everyone who takes his class needs to do so unless you want F or D or C-A with tear
3872,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"Im a straight forward person so Ill just tell you what to expect and what I experienced. The way he teaches is awful, he goes over the concept or the equation without making any sense and doesnt put a lot of effort on teaching the subject, Im the type of student who depends on the teacher but with this professor I had to study everythingmysel"
3873,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor during the summer. There is not enough time in the day. The amount of homework given was ridiculous. Up to 60 questions a day, some were multiple part. A lot were NOT even covering the test material. I am a All A student and had never failed a math test before now."
3874,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,5.0,"i got into UT and A&amp;M honors, but this class was the hardest thing. I took this class as an easier way to get calculus I credit than at my university but was mistaken. The test grading makes no sense and the homework takes FOREVER and its not on the test. Beware!!"
3875,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2413,1.0,4.0,His summer calculus class is very difficult. I typically make As in all of my math classes with a little effort but could not do this class. His grading on tests makes no sense and the homework was not like the tests at all. Plus the homework takes way to long to complete. Hes a nice guy but WOULD NOT recommend!
3876,218754,Domingo,Litong,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALGEB1314,1.0,4.0,OK first off i took this class online and 3 days in there were already 9 (20) questions due at the end of the week and also there were mandatory vids to watch which were roughly about 20 mins each and have about 10 of them. FOR JUST ONE WEEK INTO THE CLASS. This class literally gave me stress and anxiety. I would not recommend it at all. PERIOD.
3878,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,4.0,2.0,"This professor is big on spelling. Make sure you use Grammarly for your class discussions. He is very understanding and as long as you read your assignments, you will pass."
3879,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Theres 2 writing assignments , one at the end of the course over a book youre supposed to be reading simultaneously while doing chapter quizzes and discussions. Everything is clearly stated in the syllabus, very easy to follow ."
3880,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,He was a great professor for this class. He knows what he is doing and does a great job presenting his material. His quizzes are very simple and from the textbook. You get 2 attempts on everything including the final exam. He does have a midterm and a major paper towards the end of the semester but its easily doable. Take him if you have the chance
3881,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HISR1301,5.0,2.0,"Grades were over 10 quizzes (all accessible on quizlet), 4 discussion questions (had about 12 to choose from, very easy), a semester writing (over Benjamin Franklin reading), a midterm (bout 80 questions, a short essay), and a final (100 questions). Everything is on powerpoint, Professor is willing to help if asked for it. Easy to follow lectures."
3882,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,5.0,3.0,"Took his class online. He is very organized and clear. Provides extensive/helpful notes. Quiz and discussion every unit &amp; 2 writing assignments. There are two books to read, but I got an A without fully reading them. Dr. Patterson answered all my emails &amp; questions. He is very respected and I definitely recommend taking him!"
3883,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,3.0,3.0,"Well , his class is okay...I took him online but only problem is he does not give any extra credit assignments and that didnt help me much since I was never great with memory and history."
3884,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS2301,4.0,4.0,"Write well and clear, and the writing essay portions are easy. 2 writing essays, 4 paragraphs of group discussion. The big exams questions are almost all based upon prior work and questions. If you can answer any question the professor has ever asked you in this course, you WILL do well on the mid and final. Prof will subtly hint at this."
3885,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HISR1301,4.0,3.0,"I wanted to drop this class at first cos of what I read here which was true but I decided to do it. I really hate how he is more concerned with English grammar and spellings. Last time I check its history and not English. Aside that, everything is okay if you study well."
3886,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,1.0,5.0,One of the most mean professor I've come across all through my schooling. So inconsiderate towards people.
3887,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,4.0,3.0,"Took him during a eight week course online. A lot of reading, and hes extremely clear in what he's looking for and how hes grading our work. Pretty straight forward, no complaints here. I would take him online again if needed."
3888,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,5.0,1.0,An amazing teacher if I paid more attention I would have got an A. I recommend everyone to take him....
3889,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"I took Professor Patterson's hybrid class and really like it! His assignments on Canvas are well-organized. Attendance is mandatory. Also, all the materials for this class is free. He is very respectful and understanding towards his students. I thought Hiroshima (semester essay) would be hard, but I enjoyed reading it!"
3890,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,Free online textbook with A LOT of reading &amp; LOTS of assignments. Wouldn't recommend unless it's your last option.
3891,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Patterson's hybrid class and really enjoyed it. He shows respect for all of his students and clearly explains the course material. He also uses a free online textbook, which was a great bonus! I don't have any complaints about his class. I wish I could have taken him for HIST 1302!"
3892,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,1.0,5.0,omg very hard subject also he made it very hard
3893,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,1.0,5.0,very hard and tough grader i dont know why some students give him good rate i dont recommend his resources are so hard
3894,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,1.0,5.0,The hardest subject everrr he complicated the history class heavy reading I dont recommend at alllll
3895,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,1.0,5.0,Very tough grader very difficult material quizzes and exams are so difficult and you cant find them in the resources he provide
3896,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,1.0,5.0,VERY HARD MATERIAL HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND HIS QUESTIONS DOES NOT RELATE TO THE MATERIAL HE PROVIDES EVEN THE BOOK
3897,439574,James,Patterson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,4.0,4.0,"LOTS of reading. LOTS. But the assignments/expectations/grading criteria are super clear, no surprises. Everything done online including the final. Professor is easy to get in touch with. He definitely makes you earn your grade but as long as you can keep up with the heavy reading load you'll be fine."
3899,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CAL2413,5.0,3.0,"he explains material thoroughly, take this class if you actually wanna learn things and get ready to digest"
3900,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"I am not a person that would take math online, I took MATH 1332 with Prof. R. Absolutely great prof. Explains very well, he is very knowledgeable in Math. This is not an easy A class you have to work, it is college course, but rest assured he is their to help you! If you listen to lecture he gives examples, do homework , you will do fine."
3901,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"Thanks to Professor Ramharack, I managed to learn the material in a very efficient way. He gives us the opportunity to actually put in work for a better grade. Tests are challenging but it is calculus, it has to be challenge. Highly recommend this professor, he took away my math fears."
3902,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,5.0,4.0,I want to say this professor is worth taking if you want to really do well. You are an awesome instructor thanks for inspiring me to challenge myself.
3903,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2320,5.0,4.0,I'm so glad that I took his class this summer. He's one of the best professors I have ever encountered! I definitely recommend taking his class you'll learn and work for your grade.
3904,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2320,5.0,4.0,I have take this professor before for calculus and took him for differential equations. He is truly a very good professor. He prepares you for 4 year institution. I would definitely recommend him if you want to learn the material.
3905,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2320,1.0,4.0,"All these 4 and 5 point ratings are deceiving. He does not respond well and does not have clear direction on lesson plans and due dates or work around schedules than his own. His lectures are good but no review and test is not easy to plan for. Tough tests and lots of homework. Lost and not worth his time, is what you feel."
3906,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ramharack is easily the best professor I took a class with in HCC. Will make sure you understand the subject using difficult examples that will prepare you for a tough exam (really, study)."
3907,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0316,1.0,5.0,"This professor is horrible, Im trying to save everyone from taking this professor he does not provide reviews, he just makes us do the homework for our review and isnt specific enough on how the questions is going to be on the test. The Tests are very difficult because he simply does not go over reviews to help us out. Joke of a professor."
3908,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,4.0,4.0,Professor Ramharack is an awesome professor. He cares about his students. He explains the material very well and he loves the subject. I would highly recommend him to anyone who wants to learn math.
3909,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,5.0,3.0,"He's the best math teacher in HCC. Took him for the whole calculus series and no doubt he is amazing at what he does. He's always available outside the class and goes out of his way to help you. Grades exams fairly and really prepares you for a 4-year. Take him, Go to class everyday, practice and get to know him. Do this and you'll get an A."
3910,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,4.0,"GREAT professor! He really cares about his students. I took him for 1314, and he even dedicated half of his Saturday to help us prepare for the final. If he sees you struggling, he will call you out, but only because he wants you to succeed. If you really need to know Math, take him. I'm hoping to take him for all of my upper level Math classes."
3911,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"Took him over the winter for Calculus 1, amazing professor, very funny and he really did want us all to succeed. Very funny man, lectures were ok and tests are hard (I mean, it's calc, what did you expect) but he really is setting you up for the future. Definitely would take again"
3912,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sukhlal was an amazing teacher. Very knowledgeable about the subject and managed to explain difficult equations thoroughly. If he sees you having a tough time he will check on you to see if you need extra help. Lots of homework but enough time to get it all done. If homework is done, study and attend class its an easy A. VERY FUNNY TOO."
3913,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,5.0,4.0,Dr. Sukhlal is the best math professor at HCC. He is really passionate about teaching math and strive to see student succeed. His tests are kind of hard and he doesn't provide test reviews but that's good for student who want to learn more. If you'er really serious about learning math Dr. Sukhlal is the one.
3914,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,3.0,4.0,"Without any doubt he is very knowledgeable of the subject. However, his lectures seems easy but the exam is just way different and hard compare to what you find in your notes. he does not give reviews however he gives pre exam quiz which honestly are not helpful. Web assign question sometimes can be too hard and not the same as class notes"
3915,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1301,5.0,4.0,This professor is very knowledgeable and cares for his students. I would recommend taking him to anyone.
3916,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CAL2413,5.0,4.0,My friend recommended this professor. He is very knowledgeable and cares for his students. He answers all questions. He makes himself available to all his students. I will definitely take again. He makes you work for your grade. I will definitely recommend him to anyone who is interested in learning the material.
3917,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,This professor is very knowledgeable and cares for his students. I would recommend taking him to anyone. I will take again.
3918,936428,Sukhlal,Ramharack,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,1.0,3.0,Today I had my first lecture with him. He is the most boring professor I have ever had. He is trying to tell some jokes that are not even funny. I almost fall asleep during the lecture. He explains the solution of the problems in a very messed up and unclear way. He talks so quietly I don't even hear him.
3920,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1308,1.0,5.0,"Had to take this class, and I should have chosen a different prof, because Biology 1083 online was more about the tests than the homework, and the tests that only seem to matter are the in person. And the in person exams? Worse thing to happen to me. Read the textbook, but pay more attention to the slides for each chapter. Good luck."
3921,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1322,1.0,4.0,dont take her online class
3922,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1308,1.0,5.0,"So I take online class. We have quiz super easy from online. Total 6 test : 3 online , super easy , you can find online. 3 test u come to school take it super Hard, No review at all. I made an C cause take test in school no way to pass. so Hard. Good luck to all . No Recommend"
3923,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1308,2.0,4.0,The assignments do NOT help you much with tests. There are a handful of questions on the test (I recognized 2 out of 50). Most of the questions are from the powerpoint so make sure you focus mainly on those. No reviews. 13 chapters with a ton of terminology for each.
3924,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1308,2.0,5.0,"No reviews for tests, so get ready to read many power points in order to pass them (Especially for the in person tests) Was tough but I managed to pass with a C."
3925,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1308,3.0,3.0,"I did every assignment and read the entire textbook. I still found that there were questions (esp on the in-person exams) that I didn't recall being notable material in the book or the homework. I am just now realizing maybe viewing the powerpoints would've been more useful. Considering that, it wasn't the easiest but I still got an A."
3926,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,1.0,"Great professor! She is funny and enjoys teaching, she interacts with her class and is very smart. 2 very easy exams, and lab work which she allows you to complete by the end of the semester. Lab's are interesting, short and easy quiz every class."
3927,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2120,5.0,3.0,"the best professor ever, I wish hcc have more professors like her. she knows this course is not easy by itself but she makes it interesting. she is so friendly, Carey, and respectful. thanks, professor Thomass."
3928,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1308,3.0,4.0,"Not a hard class but it will definitely throw you off if you don't study the ppt which is like 100 slides. Like the person below said, follow the tips and you will at least pass. If your looking for a A in the class, then be prepared to study your butt off. No study guide provided. Made bad grades on in person exam and passed class."
3929,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1308,3.0,4.0,"I recommend this prof if you follow my tips. Do every assignment w/ aiming for 95+ grade. Do VERY well on online exams ANY WAY YOU CAN ;) To pass in-person exams (which is HARD), you need to study the ppt provided (the assignment will not suffice alone). You can somewhat fail the in-person exams + final and still pass if you follow above. YW"
3930,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,3.0,"I took the 5 week Micro lab course with her. There were 2 exams, daily quizzes, and daily lab reports. She made Microbiology an enjoyable class and a pleasure to be a part of."
3931,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1308,2.0,1.0,"If you don't care about learning anything, this might be the class for you. This online course was a cookie cutter class, that requires an expensive access code.. If you can, do all your homework on the first two free weeks so you don't even need to purchase your code. No book needed, you can learn from videos and powerpoints. Do not reccomend."
3932,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,1.0,"First of all i would say all student should rate thier professor on rmp, so everybody will know what to except from a class they are planning to take, which i would do all the time. This professor is a gem of person, her exams were quite easy. She even would let me take the quizes that i have missed because i was absent."
3933,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2120,5.0,1.0,She is everything and more than what students have rated her! I would rate her a 100 if I could!!!! Love her!!!!
3934,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,1.0,I LOVE THIS WOMAN!!!!!! SHE'S AN OUTSTANDING PROFESSOR!!!!

3936,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,AP2401,5.0,1.0,She is a super nice professor with love and caring for students.
3937,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1308,4.0,3.0,"Professor Thomas was very sweet. There are about 4 Exams and the only thing I didn't like is the Respondus download you need to take the test. I got a zero on one test because it wouldn't work. She allowed me to retake it still wouldn't download. It dragged my A average to a D. Do the Mastering bio assignments, study on the exam. The final was hard"
3938,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,5.0,1.0,EASY A!!! there were 7 exams (online) and the final in campus. Power points are on Eagle Online and she also has videos explaining everything. the book is very helpful. NO ASSIGNMENTS ONLY THE EXAMS!!!. take her and you will not regret her. I took her class for the summer.
3939,418623,Molly,Thomas,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,AP1,5.0,1.0,"Easy A if  you put in the time to study. lab exams super easy if you study the handouts Some students did not pass her lab exams but honestly did not make an effort as they would miss class constantly. If you read what she gives to study trust me , you will do GREAT!!  MADE A 100 ON EVERY EXAM!"
3941,398205,Larry,Gonzalez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Political Science,GOVT2306,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing instructor and easy to reach when needed. Lots of reading, online assignments over the chapter, and a weekly quiz but if you read the chapters thoroughly you will have nothing to worry about."
3942,398205,Larry,Gonzalez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Political Science,GOV2306,5.0,1.0,"every week a chapter is due, but its easy 1 quiz and learning smart chapter review. its super easy class worth taking"
3943,398205,Larry,Gonzalez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Political Science,GOVT2304,5.0,3.0,"I took his class around 2 years ago, I had no clue his class counts as one of the POL CLASSES credit to my university degree plan. I was so happy when I found out. anyhow he's a caring passionate and sweet professor. He loves the subject he teaches. A true pol gem"
3944,398205,Larry,Gonzalez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Political Science,GOV2306,5.0,3.0,"One of the most caring professors. Relates the material to the real world. Funny and engaging. Read, do your homework every week and get that A. He's always there to help and motivate."
3945,398205,Larry,Gonzalez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Political Science,GOVT2304,5.0,2.0,I love Larry. He was the only class I looked forward to. He was very funny and told lots of stories. He is very informative and will hook you up with students at other colleges that got scholarships that would help you. He brings cake for Mardi Gras.

There should be more online resources included to aid with comprehension. Also he should offer a live online component. Exam review for finals only. It's a lot of material to synthesize by yourself so reviews for each exam would be better. Not the worst, but not the best."

3986,438252,Manhal,Chbat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2102,5.0,3.0,"You have to study for this class, however, if you do you will do well. The tests all come from the study material and the quizzes. There are so many classes I have taken in the past to where you would study the material, attend every lecture and then you would get the test it would be completely different. He is ethical and you will learn!"

If youre passionate about your major youll put in the work and get your desired grade."
3991,438252,Manhal,Chbat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,ANATOMY1,1.0,5.0,I took this class for A&amp;P 1 and this was an online class. I had to drive to Katy to take the final exam and all the tests was recorded. You had to be on camera for each exam to make you not cheating.

3992,438252,Manhal,Chbat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2101,5.0,4.0,I took him for his A and P 1 lab course. We had 4 tests (2 MC and matching and 2 practical-written exams). The two written lab exams were the bones and muscles using diagrams and lab models. He gave you a list of the bones and muscles that you needed for the exam. He also gave reviews for each test. Lab reports were easy. Microscope exam was easy!
3993,438252,Manhal,Chbat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,3.0,5.0,I would have preferred for him to give us more resources in our online class. It was literally the hardest class I've ever taken. I will not take him online anymore.

Nice, professional, knows his stuff, clear on grading and explains everything in depth. If you NEED to pass with an A/B definitely take him. Provides reviews, extra credit, and a little homework. If you study/just listen you wont be caught off guard w/ anything"
3997,438252,Manhal,Chbat,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,5.0,3.0,"He's the best college professor you will have. He's respectful, kind, and builds confidence in people.

4005,395982,Robert,Morecook,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH1301,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Moorecook was honestly one of the best psych teachers I've ever had. His tests and pop quizzes all come directly from the powerpoint, so if you do take his class (which I highly suggest) go feral. I only really had to study for his final exam, and even then, it was pretty easy. All of his tests include essays, but they're super straightforward."

Great at explaining, and if you're paying attention you'll realize that he's very funny. Pop quizzes are extra credit opportunities, so read ahead and review with the powerpoints.

Gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit! Makes it so much fun &amp; easy to learn the material. Has a wonderful sense of humor. I really looked forward to going to class every TT.

4014,395982,Robert,Morecook,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PHY2301,5.0,1.0,"SUPER easy A. He allows a 3x5 notecard for tests and gives up to 15 extra credit points for each test.

He doesn't require a textbook, which takes a load off. All the information you really need is in his Powerpoints. No homework, only tests. You will pass the tests if you study the Powerpoints, listening to his lectures will help too. His personality will keep you hooked, truly 1/1000000"
4020,395982,Robert,Morecook,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2314,1.0,5.0,"The only thing that is good to him is that he gives extra credits, but you will have to earn it. He doesn't explain the assignments clearly. He does not seem to care about his students. Self-study is advised. His class is boring. There are so many great professors out there, so think about it. It may not be worth taking."
4021,395982,Robert,Morecook,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PHYC2301,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher , study the PowerPoints and youll be fine. Allow you to Use an index card on your tests"

4023,395982,Robert,Morecook,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,4.0,Dr. Morecook is an extremely funny man. Only thing i can day is our entire semester is based off of four tests.
4025,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2415,1.0,5.0,"Let me preface this by saying I majored in Math and have gotten A's on all previously math classes. I took his Calculus III online math class in 8 weeks, and it is downright impossible. His ""notes"" is just copy/paste from the textbook, and that's it. It really seems he has no idea about Calc III, and conversely, his students have no idea either."
4026,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2415,1.0,5.0,I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND him!!! DONT LISTEN TO THESE THEY ARE WRITTEN BY HIM
4027,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC123,5.0,3.0,I had mr. hernandez this summer for cal 3. too bad i didnt have him for my other cal classes. i had bad instructors who never email back and have confusing syllabus. mr Hernandez is very organized. he is really good.! He went over each test with me and gave me partial credit. if you can take his calculus 1 2 3 classes pick him! I recommend him!
4028,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CAL123,5.0,3.0,"mr. hernandez is awesome. best math professor i had at HCC. he did lectures and discussions online (not required) and also met with me one on one to discuss my exams, which helped a lot. asnwers all emails quick, and we did discussions on canvas for points. he also answered all replies to discussion which was also helpful. i HIGHLY recommend him!!"
4029,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Hernandez is a great professor. His methods of teaching an online calculus class work wonders! A 5-week course is tough, but his syllabus makes it possible to pass and learn a lot as you go. Follow his directions, do the assignments and ask for help early. He does an amazing job explaining concepts in ways that truly help! I recommend his class"
4030,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Hernandez is awesome! He really cares about his students. As long as you work hard, he will see that and help you out. Always happy to answer questions, and gives great, in-depth explanations. My class was a condensed, 4-week summer course. If you struggle with the subject I recommend waiting for the full 16 weeks because it is a TON of work!"
4031,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,1.0,5.0,Honestly this class was literally the most demanding class out there so if you have anything to do outside of class dont take this guy. His exams were too long didnt give curves more than 80% of the class dropped. I failed this class took another professor and made an A. He just makes this class confusing af take another prof and let google guide u
4032,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,1.0,5.0,"I work a full time job, and couldn't attend his surprise weekly video-discussions. He said it was a ""shame"" I couldn't skip two hours of work to join and get help. Discussions not recorded. COVID-work related issues caused me to miss a test. No exceptions allowed. Couldn't get help on homework problems unless I knew answers. Tutors were clueless."
4033,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2415,5.0,3.0,Love this class! Professor Hernandez is caring and gives feedback on time and make sure you understand the materials. Just make sure you did all the homework problems and you sure will pass the class and have a good grade.
4034,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,4.0,"I have never worked so hard for an A in my life. 5 week Cal 1 class and there was so much homework. I came in weak on my pre-cal and Algebra. I came out a Beast in Calculus and all the above. With math, you have to practice and you get a lot of practice with the homework. He has very good class explanations too. Just don't take a heavy load."
4035,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2414,5.0,3.0,"took dr hernandez for cal 2 online last fall. i took this course twice before with others and failed. met with dr. hernandez in his office for help with class and that helped a lot! also emailed with problems i couldnt do and he replied quick with help. points in discussions and extra credit in exams helped too! I passed with B finally, thanks!"
4036,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Jaime really cares &amp; wants his students to learn the concept and enhance their skills, always responds to questions, in-person, at office, by e-mail and we had this GroupMe where he helped us a lot. One best thing he did for us was reviewing whole College Algebra and Trig. before getting into Calculus which paved the way for us to learn better."
4037,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CAL123,4.0,3.0,"Highly recommend him. Took Cal 2 and 3 with him. Gave extra points in exams and still at the end. Always answers emails. Met with me at his office for extra help. Clear explanations. I would take him again, no question. Learned a lot from him. Best math teacher from all I had at HCC."
4038,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS2,1.0,5.0,"All I can say is DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. I took him last semester, his test is crazy hard. NO REVIEWS TEST. A LOT OF HOME WORKS. He said that he have extra credits in EXAM. TRUST ME, you will never get 100% of the test. If you guys think that I didn't study and just blame on him. I HAD THE HIGHEST SCORES IN HIS CLASS BUT I CAN'T GET AN ""A""."
4039,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,4.0,3.0,"Took this class with Dr hernandez last year. Homework was okay. Exams were pretty similar to homeworks and had extra credit. He also gave partial credit in exams and discussions. Came to see him in the office with questions, that was helpful! Also on phone. He was nice and willing to help. Math not my best subject but got B. Highly recommend him!!"
4040,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2414,1.0,5.0,"LEARN ALL BY YOURSELF. Communication is good at least. Tests are super hard, like crazy hard. Homeworks are super long, and even if you do one a day you will not be able to finish them all on time. The powerpoints are confusing at some parts and the examples are irrelevant. DO NOT TAKE MR HERNANDEZ ONLINE PLEASE. Don't waste your time like i did."
4041,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS2,4.0,3.0,"I took Cal II online with him last semester. He was available in his office and met with him or talked on the phone to go over questions I had. He was very good explaining stuff. When I missed an exam because of personal matter, he allowed me to make it up. He also added partial credit to exams.I plan to take Cal III with him. Highly recommend him!"
4042,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,2.0,4.0,"Took him online last semester, its a self teaching class. He doesn't really ""teach"" you anything. You're expected to learn the material through webassign and a textbook."
4043,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,M2413,4.0,3.0,Great class! His explanations were very clear n didn't go all over the place n made mistakes as other teachers I had. Gives bonus pts in exams n at the end to help ur grade. Do ur homework n study. He answers questions in class if u have n helps u individually in office. Will take Cal 2 with him. Highly recommend him!!
4044,431500,Jaime,Hernandez,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,3.0,4.0,"I took him online, he maxes out the homework which I did not like. If you have questions and email him, he will respond quickly and thorough. 1st and 3rd exam are online, the 2nd exam and final are proctored. You must learn all the material by yourself due to only posting power points provided by the textbook publisher."
4046,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,1.0,"Took her for the summer, one of the easiest class I've ever taken. If you're looking for an easy history class to get an A in, this is the one. 3 exams + 4 quiz + writing assignment (basically completion grade). Do not buy a new textbook, find one online. The previous version works perfectly (though she will say otherwise)."
4047,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,2.0,"I think a 9th grader would be ridiculous not to get an A in this class. Very simple, its almost impossible not to get that. If you get below that, I might rethink your decision on college. Lol"
4048,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,1.0,5.0,Although I love professor holder as a person I have never done bad in a class like never. Since the lockdown she has been awful she dont respond to emails. Dont let you know what is going on. Post assignments last minute. On ever exam she is tricky with her multiple choice questions. I love her as a person but I dont even know whats going on rn
4049,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,5.0,3.0,"Professor Holder is straight and direct. The class goes beyond the typical ""History"" routine. The instructor has many options for extra credit that are relevant to the subject matter. Her lectures are engrossing and quite engaging. I highly recommend Professor Holder. She uses an excellent study guide to prepare the class for upcoming tests."
4050,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"With the extra credits and fun classes, there is no way you can fail. Dont eve think twice my friend. Take her. I made an A..."
4051,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,She has critiqued her class for you to pass. People simply do not want to read. Study her handouts with repetition and show up to the extra credit sites. Nice Professor until you disrupt her class with your own conversation or get caught cheating on a test. Just put forth the effort and you'll be fine. -Rodger Dat-

4053,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST13011302,5.0,2.0,Professor Holder is the best professor Ive ever had at Hcc. Shes so respectful and understanding! She gives many opportunities for extra credit. I had her class this summer for Hist 1301 and 1302. You have to spend time reading and understanding the material otherwise youll be tricked by the exam. We had 4 exams and 3 essays. Take her !
4054,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,"This is a memorization/test course. She gives quizzes from the book, but teaches her own stuff in class. She requires one paper for the class, but as long as you do it, that's all she really needs for that."
4055,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"Great lectures, extra credit opportunities. I took her class for hist 1301 and 1302 and as long as you keep up with the notes and study you will be good to go. Pay attention to quizzes and tests she is tricky but if you study it won't be hard."
4056,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,1.0,History majors should avoid this prof. Extremely partisan content is taught. American History as a whole is not taught. Tests are majority trick question. She gives you exact questions and answers for the test read word for word as lecture each day. Tests and quizzes use memorization day before and morning of the test. Uses 2 text books. Easy A
4057,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,4.0,1.0,"I took Ms Holder for 1301( 4 test, 3 essays, and quizzes) and will be taking her again for 1302. No books required, and as long as your read the notes you should pass. TEST ARE TRICKY! :)"
4058,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Holder knows her History. Although you do have to purchase a textbook, she does give you most of the reading material you will need for 4 of her exams. She does give extra credit, just be aware of a lot of reading. I am not a fan of History nor reading, but she breaks it down as you go along and she does love class discussions."
4059,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,Took her for HIST 1301. The class itself is very boring. Basically the whole semester she will be reading over a packet and telling you were to highlight. She does not teach. She is very inspirational when she goes off topic. Funny at times. The essays she makes you do dont go towards your grade. The test are tricky so make you sure you study hard
4060,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,1.0,"Best history professor at HCC! She provides what you need to pass the exams and quizzes, but you have to actually READ the material and remember details about the questions, because she will switch things around to make sure you are legitimately reading and retaining the information. She is fun, easy to talk to and offers tons of extra credit!"
4061,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,3.0,1.0,Memorize! Memorize! Boring!
4062,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,5.0,1.0,"Whatever you do PLEASE find some way to experience this Professor. I thought she was tough, but she goes over the quiz and exam material prior to testing. She offer so many ways to earn extra credits. She also listens and take life emergencies into consideration, allowing you to makeup some (NOT ALL) test. PLEASE DON'T TRY TAKING HER FOR GRANITE."
4063,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,2.0,"Easy A class. we don't learn much, just go over the study guide. She does a lot of trick questions. She doesn't start class till 30 mins in. she spends the entire class grading the test you took last class and then shows you your grade and then sends you home. that's a waste of our time. I drive 45mins to get to this campus to just sit there."
4064,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"4 tests &amp; 4 quizzes! Memorize them WORD for WORD and you will make an A. If you're too lazy to do that, she gives like 100 points in extra credit to make up for your lowest test grade. Class might be boring but she lets you out early. Just make sure to highlight what she says and you're good to go."
4065,832837,Angela,Holder,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIS1301,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Holder is very nice but Her test are very tricky, so please study. The museum reports are pretty much a completion grade so try to get those done ASAP. And extra credit was helpful as well. In this class you earn you grade."
4067,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,1.0,5.0,All he does is read slides to you. There is absolutely no teaching at all. You need to teach yourself everything because he certainly won't. He talks slowly and repeats himself at least three times. He's put me to sleep twice during class.
4068,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,1.0,3.0,"he is not accessible outside of class, I've known many friends who have taken him in 3rd year of college &amp; at least 1/3rd of the class failed or given IP and told to re-book his class for a proper result, he grades heavy, is careless and easily fails people if he thinks they are not trying hard enough, reviews are nothing like exams, thick accent"
4069,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,5.0,"this proffesor didnt teach at all, he was reading his powerpoint and i took him in the summer. his class was so boring i had to snort preworkout to stay awake"
4070,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,5.0,Horrible professor. Was clearing my GroupMe messages and remembered that I did not leave a review for him (2017). He only reads off his powerpoints in a super low voice and is nowhere near helpful. Do NOT take him unless you want to teach yourself.
4071,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1342,1.0,5.0,"Tons of work with no feedback or offers of help. There's no teaching, you have to teach yourself. Highly recommend not taking this class"
4072,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,3.0,3.0,"The class consists of 6 exams (2 of which are the midterm and final which are proctored), online textbook work, and 5 discussions. Textbook work is the most tedious with over 50 problems per chapter, but if you pace yourself it's easy. discussions + test are easy. Don't take if you can't teach yourself math, very independent learning."
4073,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,1.0,3.0,"Speaks in a low monotone voice, has his back to the students on the board. Doesn't understand you if u have questions. His lectures are based on his sheets, no chance for students to absorb the concepts .Does however provide formula sheets and chance to earn extra credit on exams. Teach urself kinda class, would recommend NOT taking him."
4074,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1312,1.0,5.0,"He is extremely soft-spoken, does not like any noise whatsoever, and does not like to answer questions."
4075,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,1.0,5.0,"PSA: Do not take him. I repeat, Do not take him. If u wanna join the F club, go ahead. Just know that youve been warned!!"
4076,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,1.0,5.0,WORST PROFESSORS EVER!!!!
4077,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0309,1.0,4.0,Regret taking this class
4078,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,1.0,5.0,"Before entering his class &amp; after reading all the ratings on here, I still gave him the benefit of the doubt. But as I see, everyone here is accurate. His teaching style is an epic fail. He compiles too much info into a single class session making it impossible to retain. He failed me on Exam1 &amp; prospects are the same for Exam2. Run for the hills"
4079,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,5.0,"Hes the worst professor for math, He doesnt explain properly just blabbers and annoys during the test! Also very rude if we ask questions, doesnt care about his students at all. Never take him for Calculus."
4080,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,5.0,"I took him online and he was not helpful what so ever. You are on your own with him, he does not care for his students. He makes exam 2 and the final proctored and you have to come to an hcc campus to do them. He makes you buy a $130 code for homework. I don't know why he gets paid since the computer is teaching us and he does not help whatsoever"
4081,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0409,1.0,5.0,"When a professor says  we ganna see in the final  to his student, means a lot. Rude, doesnt know how to teach, doesnt care about anything and heavy. DONNT take him safe your time and money"
4082,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,1.0,"one of the worst teacher in Hcc, don't take him"
4083,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0312,1.0,5.0,"Be aware, not extra points for homework. They aren't extra point at all. Only 3 Test and Final. Safe yourself"
4084,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,5.0,he is very mean does not helpful at all his attitude shows that he likes to fail his students
4085,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,5.0,Very hard professor.
4086,412948,Adnan,Said,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCULUS1,1.0,5.0,Terrible and very rude professor he does not want to help you o you will regret after takinv him
4088,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"I told her that my father was a covid and I wanted another chance for the exam, she never listened to me. She doesnt care about me. DO NOT TAKE COURSE FROM THIS HER!"
4089,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST13011302,3.0,5.0,"She's not a bad professor but be prepared to work hard for your grade. It's not an easy blow off class. You really need to study and do the work. She may be better in person than online but there is a lot of reading involved as you have to read two books and take an essay test over them. Her test are not multiple choice, not even the vocab tests."
4090,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2302,1.0,1.0,"Worst professor I've ever had, not even exaggerating. Terrible communication. She forgets to email her students back. Only 4 assignments so If you do badly on one of them then you're already looking at a C in the class. Just look for another professor, I'm not sure why she has such good ratings. They must be fake."
4091,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2312,1.0,4.0,"This is not a good professor at all. Very heartless and lazy, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS. Even if there are no options left, I still would not recommend taking this professor."
4092,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,Strictly writing and discussion very interested only thing is you will have at least 2 writing assigment you will not have a clue what it is about lots of reading but NO CLUE! SHE ONLY GIVE YOU A 24 HOUR WRITING TURN AROUND! SHE OPEN THE ASSIGNEMENT AT 12 NOON AND IT CLOSE 12 MIDNIGHT THE NEXT DAY! 1 full page single space size 10 font no heading
4093,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this online course, she does not care about the class. does not get back to you on email or through canvas and I truly only heard from her once while addressing the entire class. I missed one of her only 4 graded assignments because none of it showed up in my calendar and will literally fail even though I did very well on the rest."
4094,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,1.0,Be mindful if you decide to take this class online the professor will drop you at her discretion. Doesnt matter if you logged in or not. Unethical. There arent any daily quizzes weekly assignments etc. nothing. Just 4 total assignments on the reading material. Wouldnt recommend this one to those serious about college.
4095,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"She is great at explaining without the excessive textbook reading and busywork. I would highly recommend her for people okay with writing essays, as all four tests had a written portion sometimes being combined with fill in the blank."
4096,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,Not much communication at all from her throughout course. Just read the books and do the essays (only grades are 4 essays). Great class option for those who love to write essays like me ;) Books were fairly interesting. Rented from chegg for cheap. took her online for 16 week course. The lack of busy work was nice.
4097,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"not consistent in the way she does things, opens and closes assignment within 32 hours, gives you 10 fonts and single line spacing with a minimum of 1 1/2 pages within the time frame."
4098,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,2.0,Brunets online history class is by far the easiest class Ive taken at this school. All tests were essays and fairly challenging. All you have to do is read the chapters from the textbook (that she provided) on schedule and you should get an A. Theres also two short books you have to write an essay on as well but theyre interesting.
4099,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,No one should ever take this class. 8 weeks online class with only 4 assignments they are all essays. Everything is turned in by a plagiarism checker called turnitin. So beware of that. Also she is just heartless and could care less about your GPA so just find someone else anyone else !!
4100,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"I took Ellen Brunet for HIST 1301 online. Before signing up for this class, I read all of the reviews (as I am sure you are doing) and I was overwhelmed by the number of negative reviews she had. However, I had to choose her class as a last resort and I am glad I did. In all honesty, her class is not hard if you know how to write and analyze books."
4101,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Its a straightforward class, you are not bombarded with work. There were 2 assigned book exams, one midterm and a final (all essays). I did not read every chapter from the textbook (that's academic abuse) but I did read a total of 3 chapters because the prompts were specific. The assigned books are good, read those. Easy A if your essays are good."
4102,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,3.0,"For students who have no problem writing essays without assistance, Dr. Brunet's class is good. Unfortunately, she does not offer much feedback on essays so it is difficult to improve if you are lagging behind in the class. The books that she selects for students are good and show many parts of American history."
4103,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,Basically i took this online class and she wants zero plagiarism to be detected. if she finds a sentence or a small little word that shows its the same from a website. you instant fail the class. I was an A and B student.
4104,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,Do not take this class if you want to get good grade. If only you love history and have good knowledge about US history then yes go ahead.
4105,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"I took her for a end of the semester fast track class. Everything is in essay format, which is easier, however she is a very tough grader. She only gave feedback on the first two papers, so that left me unable to improve my last two papers. I'm a writer, and the lowest grades i've ever gotten on papers have been in her class. Good class but hard!"
4106,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,4.0,2.0,"I took this as a last 6 weeks course. Lots of reading, but the essay topics are simple and clear. This is an easy class, if you actually do what you're supposed to. You can't expect to google everything! She's a tough grader, but put in the work and you will get the grade you want. 4/5 stars from me."
4107,458752,Ellen,Brunet,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,Only four assignments for the 8 week class are critical analysis essays. If your good at those it'll be an easy A for you. I'm not too good at essays and have an 87 after the first two.
4109,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"I was completing all my assignments diligently and attending all the lectures. However, I knew something was off when the professor wasn't putting grades on Canvas. It was only till after the Final Essay that we saw our real grade for the course. He expects students to be writing majors basically. I strongly advise you to pick a diff, Prof. Trust."
4110,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HISTORY1301,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor, hes tough but also understanding. Lectures are long and there are few grades! Dont procrastinate!!!"

4112,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,you need to participate in the class for you to pass.

His work is not at all-challenging or difficult, just make sure that you come to class on time and that you get your assignments done! When you get started on a major grade project, feel free to head down to his office for help."
4114,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Amazing lecturer. Assigns the readings as homework, which are used with his lecture material for graded class discussions. Term paper is a research essay based on your major and the time period the class is about. Don't be lazy, and make sure you follow his directions carefully. Final exam is a slideshow about group interests during the time period"
4115,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,Grading is on 4 books with online and in class discussions. A major research paper is due @ the end of the semester. He gives a guided checklist to follow. If you make any mistake on the checklist it counts for MAJOR points. You can fail with 2 mistakes on the list. Very strict professor. Triple check your work. Cross your T's and dot your I's!
4116,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"There aren't that many things you have to turn in, its easy to pass the class. He makes himself ready to help and answer any questions you have. Great lecturer, he always makes sure that he knows what he is talking about and never fails to educate properly. There is a paper due, but it is a college class what do expect."
4117,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"Great professor and person overall. Funny and love the way he puts together lectures. I will say he only does lectures, no power points or interactive lessons which would've been nice to have."
4118,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2301,1.0,5.0,This class was terrible. We had to write a 10 page paper in strict format about Texas history that has relation to your major. Also lectures were all over the place and was hard to take notes. There are 3 discussion and everyone must speak or you get a 0. You only have 3 assignments and 1 power-point that you must dress up nice for. Not worth it.
4119,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,Don't take him
4120,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,5.0,"Great, passionate professor who lectures off his mind with no PowerPoint! Impressive! Everything that will happen in that class is explained on the first day. Here is a breakdown explanation of what ""so many papers"" mean to some people. It's literally just one paper you have to write sooo. The class is slight work"
4121,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,3.0,1.0,"he lectures, no powerpoint. there were supposed to be 4 discussions, but we only had 1 and you have to talk at least once. he keeps attendance. there was 1 research paper, he provided the template. there was 1 group project, super easy. if you hate history but need the credit, take him. it's not that bad. there are no tests/quizzes/final."
4122,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,2.0,"he lectures, no powerpoints. there are 4 discussion and you have to talk at least once. we just had to write 5 short essays about different books, he provides the template for the essay. attendance matters. there are no tests/quizzes/final. if you hate history and just need the credit, take him."
4123,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2311,3.0,4.0,"I took him for HIST 1301, 1302 &amp; 2311. He has the easiest grading scale. If you miss more than 4 absences, he drops you a letter grade, so don't miss more than 4 classes, easy as that. I hope you like to read and write because there's a lot of it. As long as you actually try and put forth a sold effort, you will be fine."
4124,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,He is a very bad teacher. Have to write a lot of papers. Don't take him.
4125,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,"He's a very anal person with anger problems, get ready to write allot of papers, that will be graded harshly. History isn't a hard subject but with him it will be. Just don't take his class unless you want your GPA to fall."
4126,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST2311,2.0,5.0,Forget everything you know about writing a paper. He has his own format and if your works cited or footnotes are off you get an automatic zero on the paper which is 50% of your grade. It's an undergraduate course with graduate course standards.
4127,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"He's a great professor if you love history and can analyze historical events. Instead of tests there was a 10 page research paper with an annotated bibliography, in-class book discussions, and a group presentation. I had the textbook from HIST 1302 and that helped a lot, but it's not required. No powerpoints. Long lectures."
4128,255007,Joseph,McGaughy,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"PLEASE!!!!DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! We had to write 4 book essays including 1 from his own written book, 4 reaction papers, and an annotated bibliography, all which are 3-5pages long. does not respond to emails in a timely manner, long lectures.   i personally submitted my essays for online tutors to correct b4 submitting to him. i still got an F"
4130,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,3.0,4.0,"I took his online class. The discussions were fairly easy and we had one every wee. Tests were difficult to complete because there was never enough time to answer all questions. I often had to guess. Homework takes so long to finish, so don't start too late. It's very time consuming. I didn't learn anything but if you do your work you will pass."
4131,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,"i like this man, his class is easy just do the work and take decent notes and you will be fine."
4132,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,5.0,4.0,he is the best online teacher. just do your work and its an easy A. we had practice questions and 1 discussion every week. 3 tests in total and NO FINAL EXAM!! he is organized and very easy to follow. there are many extra credit opportunities. i will take him again for gov2306 for sure!
4133,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,3.0,5.0,The discussions were interesting and relatively easy (6 total). The course was embedded with the Connect MC Graw Hill textbook. So there was a practice exercise for each chapter (17 total). This was VERY time consuming. The tests he had were extremely HARD!!! There were 3 tests total. No final exam. Lots of extra credit which was good!
4134,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,4.0,3.0,Professor Steven is overall a good one. Homework and discussions are pretty easy. And he provides good feedback. There is two extra credit chances. The only thing I did not like was his exams. The questions were little bit hard.
4135,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2302,4.0,2.0,if you are an international student take him! pay attention to his explanations in class that's all the exam right there. he gives an exam review. not very funny but worth it!
4136,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,Steven Tran is a good lecturer all around. Just take the home works and assignments seriously and as for the papers don't use direct quotes to avoid plagiarism and you will be just fine. Took him for 2305 and 2306 and made both A's.
4137,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2306,3.0,3.0,He was an easy class but he had us use a different prog. that we norm. won't use.
4138,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2306,5.0,1.0,"He's a good professor. Quiz's come from lecture and if you listen in class, take note, and read you will pass the class."
4139,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2306,4.0,3.0,Listen carefully and ask if not sure if something. Does not discussing in detail. Lectures become more interesting when students participate. Most of the things he discusses will be on the test or pop quizzes. Text book is good to use with notes taken to study.
4140,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,Good professor. very knowledgeable and does well teaching the material. He used turnitin on the last paper which got me and many other students angry and scared due to the amount of plagiarism falsely detected on every one of the papers but he looked over each paper on his own and at least with mine he graded it quite fairly.
4141,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"Professor Tran made US Government an interesting class. There are 3 exams, 2 essays, and 6 pop quizzes. He gives reviews that really help with exams and posts power points on canvas which is also good. Overall a good professor, I'll be taking him for 1302 in the fall"
4142,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,3.0,"Tran is a good professor for those who aren't interested in gov. He tries his hardest to make the class as entertaining as possible, and the assignments are not hard (or a lot). The quizzes and tests will be easy as long as you do the readings and keep up with lecture notes. Definitely recommend!"
4143,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,Great teacher. Makes the requirements clear and gives announcements to remind you when everything is due. Also gives extra credit.
4144,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,5.0,4.0,Professor Tran is a fair and very good professor I am glad I took his class he is very well prepared .
4145,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2306,4.0,2.0,Professor Tran is a very good professor we had very good lectures.
4146,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,2.0,4.0,"ok. so. I took 2305 online and he is not clear or organized. there aree tests in which you have to download a webcam browser. his quizzes are the only thing you can use the book for. there are no reviews no ""here is what you need to know for the test"" stuff. had to drop his class."
4147,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2306,1.0,4.0,"I took Texas government 2306. Test are out of this world. He makes you download a weblock Browser and a webcam and youre basically recorded during the exam. You would have to study and ready day in and day out, as if it was chemistry. Not worth the hassle or F that you will get if you are busy with important classes. Dont take him if you want As"
4148,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,3.0,4.0,I'll admit I didn't particularly care for this class since it's a core class that doesn't really relate to my major. The professor is fine. Pay attention in class and take good notes. Took him in the summer and got a C. Put more effort than I did and you're guaranteed to get an A or a B. Three exams with essays attached.
4149,996951,Steven,Tran,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,2.0,4.0,"Professor Tran was an okay professor, nothing special about him. It didn't really seem like he cared for the students. He can be lenient,  but he won't care if you fail and won't mind giving you an F."
4151,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,GOVT1301,1.0,5.0,"Ive never been in a government class with a professor who openly hates the government. The irony. Also does not make grading criteria clear, grades with bias as he sees fit, pushes personal political beliefs."
4152,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HISTORY1302,2.0,3.0,"Professor Scott will shove his opinion down your throat and will actually get upset with you if you disagree. He also gets sidetracked very easily, which isn't really a problem, but he begins talking about the government and strongly expressing opinions with potentially dangerous outcomes. He tells his class he doesn't wear a mask, despite Covid."
4153,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"He is a very bad professor, I'd not recommend him to anyone. If you care about your GPA RUN."
4154,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,"He's a man who likes to laugh and has strong opinions (very far right - don't engage. Just let him talk and he'll stop eventually). Always veers off topic. Has 3 tests, 2 analytical essays, and 1 book report. Strongly suggests (read: demands) we all get the most recent copy of the textbook yet he teaches from the very first edition. Don't take him."
4155,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,3.0,Simply put I have never had a worse experience with a teacher or professor in my life. He will let his feelings towards you affect how you treats and teaches you. If you're on his bad side don't expect to pass the class. Tip to say on his good side: don't disagree with him.
4156,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,GOVT1301,1.0,4.0,Dont take this professor because he always get sidetrack in his class by watching football or stienfield. He always talks about his whole life story that no one really cares like when he got bet up by the nuns. He didnt make a study guide till the final and he never submitted anything on blackboard. Texas gov can be very frustrating with him.
4157,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He does not care about his students and is bad at lectures. He will always get sidetracked. He is a tough grader and his essays are graded like hes an English professor. I didn't put a cover page for some and he blamed me for the whole class not putting a cover page. More than half dropped his class. he sucks
4158,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Scott's class is one of the best classes I've ever taken. I was disappointed that he wasn't teaching a 1302 class when I was taking it. The guy definitely knows his stuff. Most of the bad ratings are about him getting off topic, but they probably just didn't take good notes. Pay attention; most studying will be through your notes."
4159,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Scott makes class extremely interesting and funny. Great teacher just make sure to take lots of notes and to pay attention to what he says as random things he'll say in class might come up on the test. Dates almost never came up on tests only names of different events, legal cases, and names of individuals. Great class and would take him again."
4160,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Makes class extremely interesting and entertaining. Assigns decent amount of essays but theyre all due the last day of class so you have plenty of time the entire semester. Since it was a summer class, it was a little difficult; however, A is achievable if youre willing to put in the work and effort. One of the best professors youll ever take"
4161,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1307,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Really made going to class fun and exciting! He made history interesting and he always had fun stories to tell throughout lecture. Go to class everyday and take good notes and pay attention and you should do well on the exams.
4162,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Scott will have you crying from laughter with his jokes and stories from his past which are about 50% of his class. That way he keeps the students engaged and makes the class ten times more entertaining. His lectures are also very interesting and although he recommends buying the textbook, 90% of his exam questions are from the lectures."
4163,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,GOVT2302,5.0,1.0,"Professor Scott is the best professor Ive ever had. If you pay attention and take notes in class, you should be okay. Hes very enthusiastic about what he teaches. We had a lot of interesting and engaging discussions in his class, and I truly had fun during his lectures. He is also arcanely handsome."
4164,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Scott is probably going to be one of the most memorable professors you'll have. He is hilarious and talks a lot about his past experiences but he is also very knowledgeable about not only U.S. history, but also world history. Teaches with passion and makes lectures very interesting. AND IT'S NOT THAT HARD, IT'S A COLLEGE CLASS."
4165,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,GOVT1301,2.0,4.0,"If you have a short attention span, this class is not for you. I've literally sat for half of the class in the semester and just stopped coming to class. It was a huge waste of time. He would always get off topic talking about 1302 topics and his personal life. When it comes to tests, you'll have 3 and just a bunch of papers."
4166,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,He is very funny and makes the class entertaining but the test is very hard. You will have 3 exams if you do not pass the first one you will be recommended to drop the class.
4167,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"Go ahead and take his class if you are not very serious about your grades. His class is entertaining, mostly because he jokes a a lot, and he is HOT and CUTE. He loves what he teaches but is a tough grader. Exams are tough. My research papers saved me from failing. If he wasn't so tough on exams, would LOVE to take his class again."
4168,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,Professor Scott is a great guy. He really cares about history &amp; isn't afraid to speak his mind. He's passionate about teaching &amp; cares about his students a lot. *You won't hurt his feelings if you take a few notes/laugh at his jokes  everything he says is important. Study by reviewing your notes &amp; reading the textbook sections addressed in class.
4169,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,3.0,4.0,"Class was fun, and his lectures were interesting. The tests cover mostly whats inside the book, so although its not stressed, read - the - book, or not even the papers will save you! He cares about his students in all, and he truly wants to get us involved in History. Wish i could have read more! keep track of your syllabus, and take notes!"
4170,1173915,Christopher,Scott,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,3.0,Only take scott if you hate your life 8:00 is too early to show up to class and listen to a teacher overcompensating for something and be attacked when asking a simple question. I scraped by the semester with all B's but bombed the final so be careful. I would never take him again and i hope you never have to.
4172,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"She had 10 quizzes 3 exams drops lowest &amp; final. The term paper is 5 pages without citations. She could be a tough grader on the essay. There were no short responses like the other reviews said. You can find everything online. Overall it's a straightforward class, she replies to her emails immediately and so nice tries to help. Take her!!!"
4173,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,3.0,1.0,Completely useless class. Its more of a self help class. Read the book and do the assignments. There is no personal attention or actual teaching. If you pay the tuition fees you will get an A. Avoids tough and trouble some history subjects. Don't expect personalized attention or don't think that you would walk away with learning something
4174,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,She is one of the best history teachers in HCC. Take her class now before its full.
4175,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1302,2.0,1.0,"Completely useless class and the teacher knows it. You wont learn anything new, she teaches in wholesale mode no personal attention to students. Class is easy you will get an A but don't expect anything. Better take CLEP save time and money."
4176,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,GEOG1303,5.0,3.0,"she's great, I failed the class by a few points but I am retaking it again with her I know ill do great this time around."
4177,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"She was so sweet !!! one of the best professors I had. Even though I took her online, I wished I had taken her in person."
4178,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"No doubt shes a great professor but the short answers on her test are the difficult part and there are usually 2 of those for 10 points each on her tests, so they can make or break your grade. Quizlet covers the Multiple choice answers easily, for short answers study the guide. Replies to emails fast so shes helpful throughout the course. Take her!"
4179,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"Good professor, she just grades really hard on short answers. NOT an easy A. I want to cry because I was so close. She's a good professor tho."
4180,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,"Super hard on short answer responses, TOO HARD. Only scored 5/10 points on the 2 of the short answer questions of her test. Everything else in her class is fine."
4181,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,I took her online class. Everything in her class in fine. Just answer the short answer questions in a scholarly manner. She's VERY tough on the short answer part of her test. Two short answer questions are 10 points.
4182,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"I took her online class. The quizzes are fairly easy, but the tests definitely require full knowledge of each chapter. Do not procrastinate on test reviews. Read and comprehend each chapter and you should pass. Be sure to give scholarly answers on the short-answer questions on the tests. She is tough on grammar and spelling as well."
4183,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"Good Prof. Follow instructions, do the reading and HW and you will be fine. It is not an easy A by any means bcuz of the volume of work. 1 Quiz per chapter, 2 Exams and 1 Final. The class is not difficult just requires time. Prof is helpful but takes long time in responding and feedback - which ads to anxiety."
4184,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,4.0,2.0,Her classes close within hours!!!! super easy classes.. you can find 95% of the questions online

Although I took her online course and there was a little professor-student interaction, I learned a lot due to her organized, well-prepared lectures, quizzes, and tests. learning her provided review terms in book + using the Quizlet Guaranteed A+ !"
4186,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,Great professor. Took her for Hist 1301 &amp; 1302 and would happily take her again. Easy A. Class was online and my textbook was not needed.
4187,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,GEO1303,4.0,2.0,"I took professor Robinson online and she was very quick to respond to my emails. The tests are not open book and the correct answers are not given; however, if you contact her, she will give you good studying tips. The quizzes are very simple. There was a lot of reading, but if you study her review careful you will do well on your test. Take her."
4188,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Excellent professor, There are only 4 exams including the finals and 10 quizzes in the class. She drops your lowest test score except the final exam. You can take the quizzes twice. She also will gives you a review sheet on what's going to be on the exams. This professor I would recommend anybody to take if you want a good grade."
4189,431495,Joella,Robinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Social Science,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,I took Robinson last semester for HIST1301 and currently taking her this semester for HIST1302. Her online class is so easy to follow. No essays. Just Quiz. She provides reading material for all of her Quiz/Exams. No book needed! She does require a lock down browser but even then its no problem.

He thinks if you take an online course with him, then he doesn't need to lecture because it is online honey. It is only because of COVID! He is the worse professor ever. I can't believe that he is okay with how he teaches. He doesn't put any effort into his class, not to mention his messed up te"
4196,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,1.0,4.0,Terrible professor. Does not respond to students emails. Is very disorganized. Never knows whats going on. Makes comments on lab reports that make zero sense and will not discuss or correct his mistakes. HCC needs to fire this sorry excuse of a man. Does not know how to explain organic chemistry. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN.
4197,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,1.0,2.0,BAD BAD BAD!!!!!!! He made me hate science. Has no clue what he is doing. You think your all that - you suck bad. YOU SUCK BAD!!!!!
4198,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,1.0,4.0,"The absolute worst professor I have encountered. Terrible at explaining concepts. His english is awful. Gives zero guidance for labs. Tests are not too bad, but you have to teach yourself EVERYTHING. Us students had to correct him countless times for the mistakes he was making. HCC should fire him."
4199,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,1.0,5.0,"Alright, this professor knows his material but is terrible at explaining it. Very Very Very unorganized, he'll make you do a ton of homework and then decide to just grade some of it. Very tough exams, pretty much nowhere from his lectures and notes. He curved my grade and passed me but the mental pressure wasn't worth all this. do not recommend."
4200,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,3.0,5.0,Very hard. Dr. Ewane is nice. His tests (80% of grade) are very challenging. HAVE to study book and not just lecture notes. Do all extra credit. He lets you drop the lowest exam grade except for exam 3 (the hardest). Roughly half of the class dropped and several more failed. He had to curve- I had a B and it was curved to A.
4201,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,4.0,4.0,"He is a very good professor. Professor Ewane teaches the concepts and is accessible outside of class. However, his exams are hard because you really have to understand the concepts. Best way to pass is to read the book and PRACTICE! If you work hard, you will do good!"
4202,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,1.0,5.0,"worse chemistry teacher,donot take him"
4203,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,4.0,5.0,"Wonderful teacher- you can tell he has a passion for breaking down the difficult concepts of ochem. However, his tests do not accurately reflect what has been learned. Very tricky questions. You have to study."
4204,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,5.0,4.0,Extremely enjoyable organic chemistry class with prof. Ewane; best teacher ever and would take him again.
4205,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,OCHEM1,5.0,4.0,"The most dedicated professors I've ever taken. I had to drop O Chem twice at the university level and taking Ewane was very helpful. He wants you to actually learn the subject and not just google questions. If you are looking for an easy A, do not take this class. There is a reason he is the head of his department!"
4206,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM2423,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever!!!
4207,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1411,4.0,5.0,Toughest professor I've ever had. Not an easy A. No phones are allowed. Very difficult test. Overall loved the lectures and the challenge.
4208,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,1412,3.0,4.0,I took him this summer bad idea. Most of the class was failing the first 2 exams. I dropped the class. We had to ask for examples.
4209,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,1411,5.0,4.0,"This guys is freaking AMAZING! I took him this summer and talk about a tough fast pace. He is great at lecturing and has a way with words to help you understand the material. I suck at math but his teachings helped me get the concepts. No an easy class but if you put fourth effort it will help you in the end. Brilliant guy who, who works with you. "
4210,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,OCHEM1,4.5,4.0,"AMAZING professor ! O. chem is going to be a challenge regardless, but he breaks it down for you to understand. i didnt even take general Chem 2 &amp; struggled initially but if you go to his office he'll help you a lot. ended up with a B, if i wasnt working full time &amp; did more practice problems, &amp; didnt cram for exams, prolly would of gotten an A !"
4211,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,1411,5.0,4.0,"Ewane is a great professor this man is funny and does a very good job with lectures. He does a good job at explaining things out and if you have a question he is more than glad to answer it, he can be sassy at times but don't take it personal, he's a good guy. Tests are difficult so make sure you study, drops lowest test grade, hw is extra credit"
4212,173034,Emmanuel,Ewane,Houston Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1412,5.0,1.0,I am definitely taking him again. He is very nice and respectable. He will drop the lowest grade. Gives a lot of extra points on the tests by doing the H.W's. Yeah tests are hard bc its CHEM 2 but if you study you will be fine!! Very AMAZING  teacher. Take him.
4214,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVERNMENT2305,4.0,2.0,lots of quizzes but you get multiple tries and the answers come from the book. Relatively easy but participation matters.
4215,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,"If you are a state university student looking for an online summer course to get community college Gov credit, take this professor he is a really nice person."
4216,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVERNMENT2305,5.0,2.0,He is the best.
4217,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,1.0,3.0,Only problem with the online class is that 20% your grade is decided by one written assignment (grade seems to be determined by his political biases). Only 5 assignments per semester. 4 multiple choice exams and one written. I would say easy course but writing assignment is wild card .
4218,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVERNMENT2305,1.0,1.0,"Terrible professor, try to get a different if at all possible. Only 5 assignments for semester total. Each chapter Quiz (that you get no credit for) almost never has any of it's questions on the following test, 1 answer sometimes none are found. I was top 1% of my class on a full ride but now I've lost some scholarships, loan amounts are reduced!"
4219,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"I took him for the summer 2019 semester, and he is an amazing professor. He has all of his assignments open at day one with specific due dates, and he only gives 4 tests (with two attempts) and an easy research project. He also has 5 easy discussion posts that all give extra credit. All questions are actually in the textbook and nothing is online."
4220,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2305,3.0,5.0,"I took this class in 5 weeks and it was truly hard, the test are difficult, and I had to do my project twice to score a little higher, also I did all my discussion to get extra points and I got over all 76 on my final grade he gave a C and it mess up my GPA bad. I just recommend to avoid this class in a mini semester."
4221,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVERNMENT2305,3.0,4.0,I did the project on the day of and trust me don't do that to yourselves guys. Still got 94 though lol.
4222,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2306,4.0,4.0,"Only drawback is that his tests are very difficult. Can't find the answers online and the questions range from the notes you complete from his blank questionnaire plus powerpoints and additional info. You will barely have enough time to look for everything during the tests. If you're not a good test taker, don't take this class. You might fail"
4223,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"Loved his online class. Gives you everything in modules u need even videos of his class (some made me laugh). A Lot of the questions are from the textbook questions he wants u to do- not a grade though. 4 tests, 4 easy dicussions (extra cred 3 points) so if u miss on it doesn't go against u &amp; 1 easy project; did it in 1 night and got a 94! :)"
4224,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,4.0,2.0,He is a great class to take online. He has 4 tests 4 discussions and one project. It is very straightforward. He gives everything you need to pass. I would suggest getting the book gateways to democracy online because it is very useful. You can get an A if you read over the notes and book it is not too hard definitely possible.
4225,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2301,5.0,3.0,"This was a great class, but you have to work for that A. The professor was great and so are his lectures. There are 4 tests and the study material is lengthy. You will need a book in this class."
4226,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2306,3.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS DURING A MINI-MESTER!!! I took this class during the Dec/Jan mini-mester and it was too much work and not enough time. This class kept me busy the entire time. Apparently, he writes his own test questions so it can be difficult to find the answers."
4227,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVERNMENT2305,3.0,4.0,"I took his class online and it was really hard and tough class. even if you read and study all the materials he provides, his questions are not easy!"
4228,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVERNMENT2305,3.0,4.0,"I took his class online and it was really hard and tough class. Although there was only one research paper but his exams really hard and even if you read and study all the materials he provides, his questions are not easy!"
4229,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT2305,4.0,3.0,"Took the online class and it was not easy because of course you actually have to read with critical thinking. The test are pretty hard but you get a second try. He gives you powerpoints, study questions, and lecture notes on each chapter. If you dont like to learn than this class isnt for you. It was challenging for me but I passed becus I TRIED"
4230,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2306,2.0,4.0,NOT AN EASY A
4231,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVERNMENT2306,1.0,5.0,"was taking his online class, but it was so hard that i literally cried, then dropped it. the tests were SO HARD; none of the answers were online. if you truly care about your gpa, you need to run away and find another professor."
4232,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOV2301,5.0,4.0,Taking this course is not for you if you expect an easy A. You definitely need to read and study for your grade because all of his test questions are written himself. Only one research project but was graded pretty easy. I would take him again.
4233,688218,Roy (Neal),Tannahill,Houston Community College (all campuses),Government,GOVT1301,5.0,3.0,-tests are open any time/writing assignment is available to view from the first day of class.(5-6000 words roughly but v easy) -will need to read text book -go over lecture notes bc there's test info there for sure -responds quickly to email -put in the work you'll get the A -i learned a lot
4235,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,2.0,Such a great class! It consists of 2 units and each unit consists of reading + quizzed and then a summary. Easy A! She is great!
4236,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2320,5.0,3.0,She gives prompt and precise feedback. She is caring and empathetic. Amazing teacher!
4237,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2316,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Dr. Stevens cares about her students and will do whatever she can to help you. I loved how straightforward everything was for this class - read the book, take the tests, write two papers, the end. I must admit, though, the tests were somewhat challenging. I would definitely take one of her classes again, though."
4238,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2320,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Stevens is a sweet professor, do your work, and you will pass. 10 video summaries, 4 article summaries, 1 professional journal article, 4 exams, and the final. Her instructions are specific &amp; clear. take her you wont regret it."
4239,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,4.0,1.0,"I was very overwhelmed with this class, but that's because I took it as my first ever minimester. I think I would have enjoyed the class more if I took an actual semester. Overall she was a good teacher and a fair grader. I would take this class again just not during the summer lol"
4240,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2320,5.0,2.0,This teacher is absolutely amazing and knowledgeable. I'm planning on taking her again for my next psych class!
4241,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC1301,5.0,1.0,"I have never had a professor that was so compassionate and caring since I have been taking classes here. Her class is very organized and the requirements for each assignment is very well laid out. if you don't like reading take this class, quizlet and sciemce are your best friends. I took her for a mini semester and I loved it. I 10/10 recommend ."
4242,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,1.0,"One of the best, loving, and caring professor out there. You do her work, and turn it in on time. There should be no reason why anyone can fail this class. Gives great feedback that makes you feel worthy. Not like other professor where they constantly knock you down. You wont regret taking her!"
4243,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"I missed an assignment she let me make it up the extra credit is super helpful only 2 essays, chapter quizzes and practice final and final. Just read and you will pass"
4244,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2316,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Stevens runs a good class. There is a small group presentation so fair warning. 2 papers, 4 unit tests 1 final, all open book. Tests are hard regardless of having them open book if you don't study for them first, read the chapters! She always leaves comments on papers and gives great feedback! She loves what she does and it shows!"
4245,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2320,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Stevens class was wonderful and educational. I enjoyed your class very much. I love that it is self study and you work on your own pace. She is easy to reach and considerate. She's very understanding and nice. I plan to take her for biological PSYC. online if possible. There are 4 articles summaries, 10 video summaries, 4 exams, and final."
4246,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2320,5.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Stevens for abnormal psyc and loved the class! Assignments included video summaries on interesting documentaries involving mental illness. Article summaries were easy. Tests were burdensome with 100 questions to answer for 1 point each, open book &amp; no time limit. She's a generous grader &amp; gives speedy and encouraging feedback."
4247,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY232O,5.0,2.0,This is my first time taking an online class and i took it with professor Stevens and it has been amazing! she requires 200-word summaries and unit tests. Everything is online and she gives feedback after every submission. I'm sure this class is an easy A.
4248,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,"Dr. S was amazing!! Great teacher. East A!!! 200 word article summaries, 20 question quizzes for each chapter. Easy peasy. Super sweet woman."
4249,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,1.0,"She's alright. Took her online - didn't really study or read the book, actually I never even bought the book. Everything is on quizlet or scime. It's a lot to learn for an intro to the course, but it's whatever. Finished with an A."
4250,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"She is literally the sweetest professor I have taken thus far. I don't normally leave reviews and I've been in college for a while now, but she deserves it. I took her online coarse and everything was laid on nicely. I only received a B but it was my fault. There's a lot of videos you have to watch but they aren't hard. TAKE HER COURSE!!!!!"
4251,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,1.0,"Took online SUPER easy!! Dr. Stevens is so sweet. Take this class for an easy A everything is ONLINE!! 2 Unit tests 10 chapter quizzes, and 2 Unit summary ""essays"" 200 words! so easy NO LOCK DOWN!!!!! all the answers are on quizlets. Take this class you won't regret it :)"
4252,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,1.0,Read what you're supposed to &amp; you'll pass. All of her work is easy &amp; online.
4253,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,2.0,Professor Stevens is Amazing. I really enjoyed her psych class. She gives great feedback and is very caring. Her class was very easy to follow and she leaves assignments open so that you can get ahead. It was a pleasure being in her class. I would definitely take her again. she was very easy to email and ask questions as well.
4254,336889,Genevieve,Stevens,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,1.0,"This is definitely the easiest class I have ever had. I took this class online, second start. Theres a honesty pledge, which you have to upload to start the class. If you dont, you cant do the rest of the work. Theres an introduce assignment, syllabus quiz, 2 writings which she gives full credit for whatever you write &amp; several super easy quizzes"
4256,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,AP1,1.0,4.0,worst professor I had. Did not even teach the class all we did in class meetings was 'Socrative'. If we had questions about anything all he said was that it is in our textbook/notes. DONT choose this prof. he does not care for the students at all. Does too much with respondus Lockdown Browser + webcam and requires us to use a mirror to show desktop
4257,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,"i would not recommend to get as a professor, he truly doesnt care about his students! He didnt even teach ."
4258,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,4.0,"A&amp;P in general in a tough subject.I would email him no reply for days. I would ask for help on something I did not understand AFTER I read the chap and slides, all I got was ""Read your book "" ""its in your notes just read them"". I asked for help on how to study better- ""just know all your notes"",' try harder'. I studied 5/6 hrs a day."
4259,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,"please, listen to me and do not take him. you ask for help and all he'll say is to study your notes. he does not teach at all, all he does is act cocky and even if the average for an exam is 23/45 he will not curve it. the tests have nothing to do on the material he tells you to study. even those who study hard get 50 on tests. you will regret it"
4260,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,"I dont know how he teaches, because this whole semester he taught NOTHING. The entire class during COVID was all self study, you ask him what will be on the test and all he answers is ""study the notes"" which are over 20 pages of info for only ONE chapter. dont study hw or quizzes, test has nothing on those either. if self study is for you, go ahead"
4261,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,This prof asks too much. Class is overwhelming. Every exam includes the chapters before. Uses Respondus and you have to do things like randomly hold a mirror to the screen to make sure you don't have post-its on it?! Come on. Started to take time away from all my other classes and I wasn't letting this drop my 4.0. Find someone else if you're FT.
4262,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,4.0,Took in summer 5 wk. 4 tests AND a final + department final. uploads lectures which you MUST watch to succeed in this course. tests are very difficult. I studied every day for 10 hours a day and still did poorly on tests. homework (Pearson Mastering)is easy but does not relate to lecture. I got responses to emails from him but other students didnt.
4263,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2302,5.0,5.0,"i am writing this to say mainly one thing: he knows how to teach online! which is more than I can say about many other instructors. clearly he he is expert level when come to online. course was well organized, office hours via webex are there you can always reach him. steady pace no surprises. course is tough and challenging but doable. he cares!"
4264,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,4.0,he clearly worked really hard on designing his course. Its tough but you lean a lot. He is very supportive and really helpful when you reach out to him. He had several one on one meetings with me and was very patient and understanding.
4265,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,5.0,The worst teacher ever. He does not reply to any emails nor he is helpful with studies. Simply he does not care at all.
4266,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2301,1.0,4.0,"Not accessible outside of class; never replied to any of my emails or Canvas messages I had to find him in person to discuss any questions which was simply inconvenient. He was on the phone talking during our final exam? Very unprofessional and never gave good lectures, just reading off the ppt. Better off taking it online at that point."
4267,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,4.0,"Does not explain things well at all. Lectures are just skimming over notes. Does not give any review for any tests just says review notes and read the book, then the test questions are not even covered in either of them. I got a 60% on most tests after studying very hard. Honestly watching other teachers lectures on youtube helped me learn more."
4268,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,2.0,4.0,"Sucks at explaining material &amp; very condescending when asking questions. Lots of online hw on mastering physics, if you fall behind there are always quizlets for the answers. Lectures are just reading off of the ppt, no point in coming to class. 4 tests w/ 10 pt curve, drops 2 lowest hw. Its a lot of work &amp; you cant depend on his lectures that much"
4269,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,3.0,"This class really is not to bad all you have to do is read his powerpoints (its a lot). Exams are long and hard, but he gives good curves for exams. Would take him again but maybe during the full semester or stress myself out again during the summer semester. This class should be prioritized first because of all the workload."
4270,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2302,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this class Professor gives 4 exams throughout the class, avg of exam 1 was 62, exam 2 was 60, exam 3 was 56, and exam 4 was 64. Do not take this class id you want to pass. Professor does not test to lectures or book. When the professor was asked why the averages were so low he said it's because the students do not work hard enough."
4271,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1309,4.0,2.0,omg!!! this class was super!!!!!
4272,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1309,5.0,2.0,BEST SCIENCE CLASS EVER!!! glad i took this class. I really learned a lot about biology and science but at the same time I did well on the course. class is organized very informative and gave us lots of extra credit. make sure you complete all the assignmnts online quzzes etc. glad I dont have to take any more science classes!!!!
4273,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1309,5.0,2.0,i am really glad i took this course it was well organized to the point and I got an A!!! I needed a science credit and I heard good things about her class. if you do all the assignments the tests are easy breezy. take this course!!!
4274,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,4.0,hands down best prof i had at HCC. this course is the toughest I had at HCC. this is 2nd time i took it. I wish I had him first time. he was so organized and very helpful. He took the time to talk to me and give me advise. I feel much better about my chances to get into nursing school. If you want to go nursing he is the best choice.
4275,1394408,Shadi,Kilani,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2302,5.0,3.0,I am so glad I took his course. It wasnt easy but you know what it was totally worth it!. He gave us many opportunties to improve our grades. he also had a sense of humour. I like how well organized his course is also the discussion were really helpful and informative. If you are serious about nursing take his course
4277,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"Stay away from Dr. Drake if you're going to take history at HCC! I took him in spring 2020 in person. This professor is very difficult to pass history in his exams. Even after transitioning to online due to COVID-19, he never graded anything on Canvas after the exams were due. Fortunately, with pass/fail option, I elect no credit from this course."
4278,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"you get 4 essays each worth 25% of your grade. He doesn't specify word count or essay format and once you turn in your essay he heavily focuses on grammar and corrects you on meaningless things. I got points taken off for writing ""anti-war"" he said the correct word is ""opposed"", both mean the same. Don't take this class, even a C is hard to get."
4279,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"All he gives is 4 essays that are 25% of your grade each. He gives a ""guide"" for the essays but they are pointless so you are basically set up for failure. My first essay was 3 pages long and I received a 75 and then for the second essay I wrote 15 PAGES and got a 78!! He is so picky about the essays, it's like he doesn't want his students to pass."
4280,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,Teacher was terrible only three assignments and all of them were essay exams. He didnt really give us format on how he wanted the essays to be written and how long he wanted the essay to be. His feedback is just terrible he didn't make it clear on what he wanted on the essay or what you did wrong on the essay. I dont recommend this teacher.
4281,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,1.0,I am in the middle of the semester in this class and I havent felt so hopeless in my whole journey of schooling. I have tried to email him multiple times for clarification on my assignments but no response! I had to email my classmate for help. He is a very tough grader and gives no feedback to help for future essays in this class! DO NOT TAKE!
4282,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"His whole course is just broken up into 4 exams that are 25% of your grade each. He gives you messy study guides that barely help you. Each exam is just giving you 7 essay prompts and answer 3 of them. He just says answer them in a ""essay format"". Does no lectures and only gives you the study guides and exams and says Good Luck! Avoid. Save ur self"

4285,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,3.0,"I just finished a 5 week course with him and he told me my work was egregious and I deserved an F. I was so frustrated because he never communicated anything with us that I decided to review him on here. Lo and behold, a number of my classmates have also taken the opportunity to warn others of this professor. Do yourself a favor and steer clear."
4286,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,2.0,5.0,"I took online classes with the Professor Drake. He just posted the assignments,but the instructions are not clear. I had to ask to my classmate about it and emailed to him several times. I had a bad experience because I wrote like 12 essays. I have never receive a grade on Canvas or feedback. I felt lost because the instructions are not clear."
4287,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"Please do not take this professor. Save yourself some time and money. He is a super hard grader, even if you answer the question correctly and to completion. He is not reasonable and will not help you out. Gives harsh criticism that is not helpful or insightful. I repeat, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR."
4288,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,I took him for a four-week class over the summer. I've had the worst experience. He has nothing on his canvas page. He doesn't give concrete instructions so I have had to email him multiple times. I have written over 8 essays already and I am working on my final exam which is an additional 3 essays. He is extremely hostile in emails. Don' take him!
4289,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,1.0,Impossible to earn anything more than a C in this class. Do everything right on the exam and he will nit-pick the essay until you have a C. Cannot win in this class. Do not take!!
4290,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,5.0,"Take notes , tough grader on test. questions and essay for test and quizzes. book essays are required in this class. if your not familiar with US history read all you can. he was a good professor but lectures and test are graded heavily."
4291,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"He lets you take notes in class, but subtracts your marks if you write down what he taught you in class. What he said are in the text book, yet he fails you for writing it in test. Too bad!!! More than half class withdrew. Can't even read his writing on the board."
4292,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"This Professor knows his history and is very funny. However, his tests are impossible to pass! The essay is worth fifty points and he gives minus 30 or 20 points for writing down info he told us in class! Over half of the class dropped."
4293,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,I would not take this class again. Very bad handwriting. You can feel the tension in the room just by the way he talks to his students. I'm sure I can speak for the class by saying no one wants to ask him questions because he will come back with a rude response. Nothing but reading reading reading. Might as well take the class online.
4294,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"Great professor- very passionate and knowledgeable about history. His classes arent easy As and you will have to read the textbook and the assigned reading. He only teaches by lectures, no powerpoints &amp; doesnt write on the board. Really important to take thorough notes as he lets you use them on his tests. Overall, a great class and learned alot"
4295,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"I don't really like to reading books. But, took him I gotta buy 8 books. Waste lots of money. Then, he is too horrible to keep sitting his class. Me and three of my boys had to dropped. I mean if you take him, hold on to buy books. You shouldn't buy books, but then drop classes like me!"
4296,457302,Chris,Drake,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,Learned more about US history from Professor Drake than I have from anyone else. He is a very tough grader but he wants you to do well. If you take good notes and pay attention in class you will be fine. Make sure you read all the hand outs he gives you because there will be a quiz over it. Tests are easy if you take good notes/read the textbook

4300,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL2311,5.0,3.0,"Clear instructions and Powerpoint. The assignments and papers are not too difficult. The only problem is that you won't see your grade and feedback until the last day of instruction! However, he's an easy grader so just put some efforts into your works and you'll be fine. Take this class if you want an easy A."
4301,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,4.0,2.0,"Took him for spring 2020. Tells interesting stories about his life, gives you amazing feedback when grading papers."

This class was an easy A. Just write your papers and turn them in on time. There were 4 papers and a ""lights, camera, action"" introduction project that took me like 20 minutes to do. TAKE HIM!"
4303,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,EN1301,5.0,2.0,"Im so happy I took this professor! Take him if you can! His work isnt hard, hes lenient with his students, and hes hilarious! He makes what he wants in an essay very clear, is very understanding of his students, and isnt a tough grader. Would definitely recommend! This class is an easy A if you try!"
4304,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,3.0,"4 short papers in total which i think he just gives whatever grade the software gives. offers no feedback . 4 peer edit reviews on your paper on DB. &amp; 2 other ez assignments . class always had issues turning in stuff even on the due date bc there was no place to submit. when we would contact him, he never answered.u wont know ur grade til the end."
4305,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,COMP1302,5.0,1.0,I love this professor I took him for both 1301 and 1302 please TAKE HIM
4306,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,5.0,2.0,"I took his online English class for the summer and never felt so relaxed. His instructions are clear and to the point. This class included a few discussions and about 4 essays, one due each week. He also provides videos and power points to help you throughout the process. Very understanding, I missed a deadline and he still took my essay in."
4307,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,1.0,"He is the easiest class ever for English. He is very funny and lets you write on any topic depending on what it is and there is no pages minimum, as long as it's an intro, three body paragraph, and a conclusion you should be fine."
4308,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,4.0,3.0,This was an easy A. The only thing that bothered me with this class was that his Turnitin never worked and we had to constantly message him about it. I turned in an assignment a day late bc Turnitin was down and got points deducted. 4 essays all very easy to do.  My advice would be: if Turnitin is down email him on canvas and his HCC email. CYA
4309,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301ONLINE,5.0,3.0,"i took the online class, he understands people have lives outside of school . im a full time firefighter with a 2nd job and father of a young child returning to school in my 30s and was easily able to take his engl 1301. thanks for helping me achieve my goals! i hope to take more of his classes soon"
4310,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,1.0,"Prof Downey is not a very good professor. Doesnt reply email or whatsoever. Grading skill is very wack cos he uses turnit and one other site to check your grammar structure and whatever it gives as your point is what he gives to you. He grades last minute, no chance to improve when your grade is low as its final. Horrible!!!!"
4311,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,2.0,4.0,Lazy teacher. Gives no direction on how you can improve so just do your work and hope for the best.
4312,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,5.0,1.0,"Best english teacher I've ever had, I highly recommend him. He's hilarious and always has good stories to tell. Only 4 papers over the course of the semester, very easy grader."
4313,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,4.0,2.0,"He was a recommendation which I don't regret taking it. I took him online, first class online and he was very easy. He's a quiet person, doesn't grade the essays right away and no feedback either. If you take him online, there's 2 discussions, and 4 essays. Not very hard to be honest. If you're looking for a challenging professor, this is not it."
4314,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,2.0,1.0,"I took Professor Downey's class during the summer 5-week class and he was very quiet. No emails or anything but there were 4 essays, 1 each week. The topics were interesting enough and although I didn't know any of my grades in this class till it was over, I managed to make a high A. Very easy class even though the prof is non responsive."
4315,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL2311,5.0,2.0,"Professor Downey is a blessing. Initially, I became skeptical upon how the online class was going to work. And through Spring 2018, I managed to come out with a 95. Only minor issue is that he will never reply back to your messages. In addition, he does grade assignments at the last minute. Take note of that. Regardless, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL."
4316,419132,Carlton,Downey,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG2311,5.0,1.0,EASY EASY EASY! Take this class you wont regret it!! Such an easy A!

4319,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,4.0,"If you take this class; be prepared to learn everything yourself. The lecture is him reading off the slides at best which is like an audio version of the text book. I dont get how some of the comments say hes the best, because there has to be better teaching out there. Reading is important but a teacher should also TEACH in my humble opinion"
4320,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,1.0,"I had the whole world working against me during the pandemic, I wanted to drop out but this man who I have never met even as I am typing played the role of a father. He listens, he is caring. There are quizzes and test that will help you. Thank you Dr. Sharma."
4321,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,1.0,I had a million and one things working against me during this pandemic but I scaled through because this man is a father. I have never met him but he gave listening ears and helped when he could. Don't mind those negative reviews. Amazing lecturer. Level of difficulty Zero.
4322,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,SCIT1408,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sharma is an outstanding educator. Can be a bit difficult at times but is very understanding and will work with you. Be prepared during class he will ask for participation and he does not coddle after all this is college and we are not children, and to quote him ""if you fail his class, he has failed you as a teacher."""
4323,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,SCIT1408,4.0,3.0,"Professor Sharma teaching style allows students to be very involved during the lecture, creating an interactive environment.

4324,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,"Please do not take this professor if you don't want to fail or mess up your GPA. He does not care about student's progress; always suggesting you drop the class even at end. I studied so hard yet with each exam I manged to pass, my cumulative grade kept going down. I wouldn't know if there is anything wrong with his grading rubric. A big nightmare!"
4325,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,2.0,4.0,Online course. Sorta difficult class because sometimes he would ask random stuff not learned/not in textbook. You also had to teach yourself. Drops couple grades. Final:review of previous tests/quizzes. There's a Departmental final. He provides you with a lot of study resources. Written assignment is very easy. Takes a while to respond to emails.
4326,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sharma is an amazing professor. He is very enthusiastic and shows great passion for his class. AP is a hard subject, so it naturally requires you to really put your work into it. Despite its difficulty, Dr. Sharma makes things easy to understand. I highly recommend taking lab and lecture at the same time, and put your time and soul into it."
4327,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,AANDP1,5.0,3.0,If you are not going to set this class as a priority do NOT take it. By far one of the best professors I've had at HCC. Professor Sharma is extremely thorough and will prepare you for exams. You have to put in the work to get the grade you want. This isn't a class to study the night before and expect to do well. All the resources are there.
4328,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,"The % of grades are ridiculous. 54% for lectures. 20% for final exams 10% for HW&amp;quiz 1% for syllabus quiz. You add it up its 95%. 54% for 4 exams is outrageous. Lots of work and none of it gets on the exams. Exams are hard. Makes tons of mistake. Lect vids hard to understand, forgot the other parts of it.I dont even make bad grades and failing."
4329,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,3.0,"This teacher isn't great online as ppl say. His class is unorganized, his hw, quizzes and his exams don't prep you for the departmental final. He is very difficult to talk to via email. I don't recommend taking him online. Find a better professor or be prepared to hurt your head trying to prep for exams that's sporadic and left to the unknown."
4330,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2101,5.0,4.0,"Prof Sharma is amazing. He teaches so well &amp; puts in the maximum effort to make sure that you understand the information. The best A&amp;P professor at hcc PERIOD. However, this doesn't mean you won't have to study to do well in this lab. A&amp;P is a tough class-either way you will need to work for an A if you want it &amp; there is no easy way out of that."
4331,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,AP2401,1.0,4.0,"Sets you up for failure, does not go over quiz so you can know what you did wrong, no extra credit, cant speak English well, and is horrible Took him for A&amp;P 2 lecture"
4332,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Sharma is extraordinary. Please DO NOT take him if you're looking for an easy A. If you want to take on a challenge and make something of yourself, this is the man for you. Those individuals who posted negative reviews failed to take on this challenge and see the value it held for their future. As a result, they lashed out and complained."
4333,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,ANP1LAB,2.0,4.0,"He starts semester saying everyones opinion is accepted and their are no dumb questions, so ask anything!! Then you do and he acts dumbfounded and makes you feel small as a dust mite with his response. His accent is very tough to understand and his method of teaching material is an acquired tastse. He works for some but not my cup of tea"
4334,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2302,1.0,4.0,"Took him for A&amp;P 2 lecture and hes only taken the time to actually lecture a few times. Most of the time in class hell just sit there and ask if we have any questions over the chapters which he expects you to read on your own. There are 4 exams and a final along with another district final, so he makes you take 2 cumulative finals for no reason."
4335,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,2.0,He is one of the best professors i've ever had. He really cares about his students &amp; even gave me a nickname. He's also really funny. His courses were very organized and he teaches really well. He makes us participate which really helps in learning. The tests are easy but you really have to study.
4336,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sharma is one of the best biology professors for BIOL2301/BIOL2101. I was in BIOL2101, but I wish I had taken his lecture class. He explains very well, he gives homework that's is ACTUALLY HELPFUL in understanding and memorizing the materials. I'm taking him again for BIOL2301/2102. He genuinely cares for the students, and is always available."
4337,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2101,5.0,4.0,"He really cares about his students and wants to make sure that you understand the material. He goes over everything that will be on the exams during the class, but that does not mean they are easy. Show him respect and he will show you the same. I highly recommend him if you are willing to put in the work and actually are interested in anatomy."
4338,615919,Chandeshwar,Sharma,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,AP2301,4.0,4.0,"Good professor overall. He makes you really learn the material. His project work assignments are heavy but they really prepare you for the tests. 4 tests and a comprehensive final. Its not an easy class, put in the work and you'll easily pass. His lecture class is heavy, but his AP 1 Lab class is easy."
4340,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ELG1302,5.0,5.0,Ms. Broussard was one of the best teachers Ive had so far. Her assignments were long but they werent hard to finish. As long as you use the readings she gives and you participate youll do fine.
4341,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,I loved her class. Do EXACTLY what the assignment is and youll get a good grade. And she gives make ups and E.C.
4342,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ELG1302,2.0,4.0,"The classes is hard to make an A in. I am a good writer and i had trouble barely making B on the papers. She grades tough and gives some extra credit. 1500 word papers total of 4, gives pop quizzes. I made a B in this just barely but i would never take this professor again. Her only upside is that she doesnt make you read books i guess. Eazy C tho"
4343,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,4.0,4.0,"In addition to my 99, no offense to students who are average workers like myself, you can do it. It may be a lot to read/write but its only to make you a stronger reader, writer, and thinker. I believe that her method of grading will help in the future for maybe history/gov or maybe a lab report, idk. Disclaimer: feedback is pretty slow on papers."
4344,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,4.0,4.0,"Prof B is actually a good prof. Ngl, when I first got in there, it was right after Harvey so I was very unorganized. Then after two weeks, I knew she meant bizz, so I had to change my thought process. COMPLETE READINGS THEY WILL HELP YOU!!! FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS!!! Guarantee high scores! Doesnt normally provide As I received a 99 on final b overall"
4345,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,5.0,Hard but fair and you really do learn alot but not easy. You can talk to her and she meets you in her office or in Skype. That's what I liked because she was available when I had time since I work during the day her office hours didn't work for me.
4346,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,"I liked Prof B. She gave extra credit, answered questions, even crazy ones, and made it fun."
4347,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,I enjoyed her class. Good feedback. Chances for EC. And my questions were answered fast. Do what she says and you'll pass with a good grade.
4348,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"Took her class and got an A. But it wasn't easy. She grades tough during the semester, but my grade showed a online. I got a B on my transcript. I got good feedback and she always responded to my messages, sometimes really late at night. When I had a question, she met with me via Skype. She's tough but fair and you learn a lot. Not an easy A."
4349,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,2.0,3.0,Tough grader and the feedback isn't always clear. I'm not sure what the expectations are for her. It seems nothing sounds good enough.
4350,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,Way too many reading assignments with an essay due every week. She docs you for every little mistake. I would never recommend her to anyone unless you love reading and writing essays that have nothing to do with the tests she gives.
4351,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ELG1302,1.0,3.0,professor B is alright. to be honest i would not recommend taking this class unless you wanna talk politics and have debates about different topics to write about.
4352,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ELG1302,5.0,3.0,Easy A if you do what's posted and don't miss assignments.
4353,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,5.0,2.0,Her class wasn't easy but it wasnt hard. Its one of those kinds of classes that you can't log in and just look at the assignment and call it a day. You have to really look at all the stuff and she gives a lot a bunch of stuff. Sometimes she gives too much stuff to look at but its all good resources. Overall I learned a lot. The work was just right.
4354,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,3.0,3.0,"The class overall is poorly organized, though I do commend the professor for allowing the class to choose their topics based on the readings assigned. However, she did not grade our papers in a timely manner, rarely giving feedback on essays. This resulted in many mistakes made in our following essays."
4355,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ELG1302,5.0,3.0,The individuals giving bad rates are one of the following. Feel like they shouldn't have to work for their grade. Don't come or show up late to class with poor participation. She stays after to answer any questions. She specifically helped critique one of my papers before it was due. Class discussions . Works with you. GROW UP AND DO THE WORK.
4356,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,3.0,5.0,I have to be honest about this professor. Prof. B generally cares about her students and strives to pull students potential out and is a great communicator. She really came through for us. Was the struggle worth it? YES Would I take her class again if I had the chance? NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.
4357,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,4.0,5.0,"This was an amazing class. Though it was online, it was easy to see that Professor Broussard has a big heart. She really does want you to learn. And I did. I learned so much. About writing, about thinking, about critical theory. However, I would not take this professor again. Why? The online class lacks clarity and adequate organization. STRESSFUL!"
4358,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,5.0,4.0,"At first I was NOT liking this prof. But once I started getting it, I LOVED it. Yes we did read a lot but it was all really good stuff none of it was boring. I was able to call her when I got confused about something and she texted right back when I texted her. I thought I was getting a C, but I got a B. She really works you to make you learn!"
4359,1593376,Camisha,Williams,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"Poor professor, causes you to overthink your assignments and not very timely with grading assignments. When you think you are doing well in her class, you get a bomb dropped on you. You have to work way too hard to get a good grade in her class."
4361,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,2.0,Professor Mello is actually really interesting. She knows her material very well. She's clear about what she expects from you and gives a lot of extra credit . The multiple choice tests can be hard but she gives you a study guide. The written assignment is easy-questions about a story and the answers are in the reading she provides.
4362,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,2.0,Ms. Eileen teaches exactly what is on her tests and is very clear. She is very passionate about her job. Would highly recommend taking her class.
4363,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,3.0,"decent teacher, only has a few grades so you better study for the test, she's pretty arrogant and snobby, gets annoyed quickly, her lectures are boring and she makes you pay attention the whole class"
4364,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2314,5.0,3.0,"She is a great teacher. You do have to study because the tests can be difficult. . She is fair with her grading and gives extra credit. If you pay attention, do your work and dont goof off in class, you should do fine. Enjoyed the stories she told in class."
4365,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,4.0,This class was like time for nap time for me. I would go in there and man when I tell you if someone paid me 10000$ to not fall asleep I would still fall asleep. Shes BORING but super sweet. I didnt learn anything because shes too sweet and she speaks low. Its like shes singing a lullaby for you to fall asleep !
4366,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,2.0,"She's a very good teacher. She gives study guides for each test. If you follow the study guide youll pass. Good examples that guide you through the class. She isn't necessarily a tough grader, but you do have to earn your grade. Recommend."
4367,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,3.0,4.0,"I took this professor for a required class. At first she was great, started the semester with a positive attitude. After the first exam a few weeks in everything flipped. Though she provides a study guide and encourages questions, she easily gets irritated when a lot of questions are asked. Overall, if you ask questions expect sarcasm or attitude."
4368,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PYCH2314,4.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed taking this class, she can be a bit sarcastic but she is a great teacher and knows what shes doing, i would absolutely take her again!"
4369,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,3.0,"Took Mello for two classes, this professor is very good, very helpful, funny, no-bs attitude, expects you to participate. The material isn't difficult if you work. The study guide is very helpful Unsympathetic if you blow off the class and ask for a higher grade. Does offer extra-credit work."
4370,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,3.0,"Great professor very funny. Would recommend her to anyone. Just attend class, pay attention, do your work, use the study guide, read and you'll pass."
4371,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,2.0,"Shes a very funny teacher, gives lots of chances for extra credit. I got an A and I really did not study that much for this class. Easy paper. Study what's on the study guide, would take again"
4372,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,1.0,1.0,she is nice.. but her test is totally out of syllabus.. dont select this professor and dont buy book. she only read the powerpoint slides.. boring class ever in HCC
4373,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,1.0,1.0,dont take her.. she is rude
4374,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2314,5.0,2.0,"Lots of extra credit is offered. Three test and one final. Class participation is a must. She will call you out for being on your phone, sleeping, or talking too much. She just wants to be respected while lecturing. Good teacher, easy grader."
4375,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,4.0,"Well, she is a good teacher but her tests can be hard. But she does give lots of chances for extra credit. Like the stories"
4376,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,2.0,3.0,She can be very condescending to students if they do not answer her questions 100% correct. She is an interesting teacher but can be rude and sassy.
4377,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,"She is really funny, expects you to do well in her class, and wants you to pass her class with good grades."
4378,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,4.0,3.0,"Very passionate about the subject, if you really want to learn this stuff she is a solid choice. I only took it because it is required for my degree, so if you are like me, stick to online. Received a ""B"" off of power-point learning, hardly showed up to class and rarely did I open the textbook (maybe once-ish). 4 exams, the final, and a term paper."
4379,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2314,4.0,4.0,You must read the whole book but its better if you learn only what she puts in her slides! She is funny and make the class interesting! Expects participation&amp; to read the chapter before class! Loved her
4380,496952,Eileen W,Mello,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,4.0,I like this professor! All you need to do is answer the questions from the chapter review and use that as a guide for the tests and the final and youll pass the class! Show up for the lectures! Dont go to class if your sick! Her husband has a compromising immune system and she cant risk getting sick! She has a great sense of humor.
4382,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"I didn't know about rate my professor that's why I choose her, but trust me it is almost impossible to pass the class she never grade your assignment until she wants, when I started the course I made many assignments on September but she graded until October, and she didn't give a good feedback ( Most of my classmates withdraw the class)."
4383,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"RUN!!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR, ONLY IF I WOULD HAVE SEEN HER RATINGS BEFORE TAKING HER CLASS."
4384,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,I took her when the pandemic first hit in March. Before the pandemic she was still a terrible professor. She had high expectations for all paper but her feedback was extremely vague. She mostly said pay attention or go over MLA again. When we went online she disappeared for 3 weeks. 2 days before the term ended is when I finally got my grades.
4385,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,5.0,"It's taken 2 months for her to finally grade an assignment and per usual she gives extremely vague feedback. The feedback she gives is basically ""pay better attention."" She grades harshly even after telling the class she would be more lenient in the beginning. She also won't let you into class if you're more than a few minutes late."
4386,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"I'm taking this class in the middle of a pandemic. She had told us AT the beginning of the class that she will take it easy on us because we're working from home. Now, she literally just grading our first assignment from TWO months ago and gave us nonsense comments. I don't know if I'm going to pass this class now. Save your money."
4387,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,4.0,"Feedback for Essay 2 was given days after class ended. With COVID issues she never gave feedback, direction, or responded to emails and then awards bad grades. So basically she did not honor her part and we all suffered."
4388,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,1.0,5.0,"You could do a minor error and she will deduct many points of your paper. Class consisted of just talking over the assignments &amp; providing with minimal &amp; vague advice. I lasted 3 weeks w/her until I dropped her for the sake of my gpa. I worked extremely hard and many of the students did too, but she always found something wrong on everyone's paper"
4389,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,Ive never written a review for a professor but I feel obligated to tell you how bad her class is. This class will break your spirit. She is vague in her teaching (if you can call it teaching) and a hard grader. She has the volume of a mouse. She is quite frankly a bad professor. Do not take this class.
4390,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,1.0,3.0,She's the worse has a lot of assignments very picky grader think at this point she should retire. I've always been on time in class did the work and had a C in her class most everyone drop out expect a couple students including me
4391,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,1.0,4.0,Do not take her class! She is a terrible teacher that does not teach you at all. she doesn't answer questions and gives assignments with barely explaining them.
4392,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"Do not take her class !her unstrutions are unclear,she won't answer no question ,and she is a though grader."
4393,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,3.0,5.0,"If you're looking for an easy A, she's not the professor for you. She will make you work and she expects you to follow her instructions to the T. She's not awfully hard, she's just very tedious. Her lectures are long and for the first half of the semester, we kept going over MLA format every single day. You'll need to make a lot of effort for an A."
4394,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL2311,1.0,4.0,"Honestly worst professor ever at HCC. Her directions are not clear at all, one day she tells you to do an assignment, and the next week she wants you to do it all differently. If you need this class, I would highly recommend you take it with another professor. She clearly does not care about the students, the highest gradeshe will give you is a B+."
4395,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,Houston Community College im calling you guys out! Shame on you! For allowing Marylin Douglas Jones to continue teaching! She is literally destroying the lives of so many hard working students. Its not fair for those who work incredibly hard! Students I repeat DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!! Save your money! Save your GPA! English department shame on you!
4396,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"She is terrible teacher, stay away from her class. She will drop your GPA"
4397,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst teacher I have had, she wants from you to do all the assignments as a professional. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS"
4398,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"Dont waste your time, money and Gpa with this professor. Doesnt know how to teach. She just pulls out two websites and reads from it expecting you to learn something. When you turn in your paper, she just makes marks on it and doesnt explain it very well. Unclear instructions. Take Cecillia Bonnor instead for ENGL 1301 &amp; 1302 for easy A."
4399,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301AND1302,5.0,3.0,"She is a very professional person, follows the syllabus accordingly and awards grades based on merit. If you don't put the extra effort which the class requires you may not find this professor easy. ENGL 1301 and 1302 are courses that involve research and writing, so be ready! Her classes come with added knowledge on world issues."
4400,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,"I honestly disagree with most of the bad reviews. If you engage in class discussion, turn your work in on time, FOLLOW HER CLEAR DIRECTIONS (which she emails), and have open communication with her you will pass this class. It is not an easy course but you will leave with a lot of knowledge outside of ENGL1301. I only got a B due to missing an exam."
4401,503349,Marilyn,Douglas-Jones,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,5.0,If you wanna take her class think again she is literally failing everyone in the class we had a class of 30 it drop to only 7 people no likes this class. Theres only one person with a decent grade of 70 if you want to save your college GPA and money dont take this class. Her directions will leave you clueless and lost the whole time you take her.
4403,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,4.0,4.0,Don't miss class to avoid falling behind. Explains topics thoroughly using examples from the textbook.
4404,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,3.0,4.0,"The class is a tough subject. You need to be well prepared to work in class since he is only going to give you examples and you have to work them out. He gives a ton of homework, but all that work is useful for the test."
4405,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,TRIG1316,4.0,5.0,"Lots of homeowrk. Never miss a day of class well. First test was not graded heavily, but others are. Study everyday."

4408,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,4.0,4.0,"Professor Mahdy is a great professor who teaches the material well, but be prepared to work in his class. He gives an above average amount of homework, but it helps out in the end because it prepares you for the exams. Attendance is mandatory in order to be there for the lectures, which help understand the material better. Overall, relatively easy."
4409,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,4.0,5.0,The teacher uses the book to help students understand the different materials that would be covered on the next exam. He goes through all the practice examples so that when the students do their homework they would understand how to get the answers by themselves.
4410,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,4.0,5.0,"He lectures by pulling questions from the book, and breaking them down in a manner where the student understands it. He tries to make sure the student is able to understand the work before moving on the the next lesson. Overall very respectful."
4411,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2320,5.0,4.0,be prepared for homework and studying. Its not an easy class or subject. I feel prepared to transfer to university now after completing Prof Mahdys class. He is one of the better professors I have had at HCC.
4412,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,5.0,4.0,Great Professor but expect to do the homework and study. He knows the subject very well. He let us do corrections on the 2nd test to earn more points. You get 100% credit for homework so its an easy grade as long as you do the assignments.
4413,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,1316TRIG,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, class is very difficult if you are to miss even one. Tests are a challenge, as well as the homework, so you must be prepared for a tough math class."
4414,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,3.0,4.0,"The professor is very vague when it comes to giving examples, needs to explain the concept more, however he manages to teach what you need to know."
4415,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,TRIG1316,3.0,4.0,"The professor is strict , but he teaches what you need to know for the course. If you do your work on time, participate in class, and ask questions, the tests will be easier for you. Come to class prepared and ready to learn. He doesn't waste time during class."
4416,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,3.0,4.0,"The professor will try to help his students the best that he can, he knows the material but a lot of work is required to pass."

4418,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2320,5.0,4.0,Very organized class. Professor Mahdy gives clear reviews for every test so you know what to expect. You definitely have to study for the class but you learn a lot.
4419,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,5.0,5.0,Professor Mahdy was very helpful.
4420,2116838,Hany,Mahdy,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1316,5.0,4.0,"Profesor Mahdy saved my math studies.

4424,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HISTORY1301,5.0,3.0,"This professor is so amazing. He gives the best lectures, full of information. He knows his history. You must read your books as well. But he is good. I took him for 1301 and 1302."
4425,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING PROFESSOR. He makes History interesting and gives great lectures. Thanks to Dr. Botson, i can now go more than an hour without looking at my phone. He posts the exact essay questions on his learning web for you to practice weeks before his exam. He is motivating. I highly recommend him."
4426,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,I took him for Summer 2020 a 5-weeks class. He is pretty straight forward on what he wants. There is only 3 essay exams and 1 book project. They aren't hard you just have to put in effort. He grades fast and give his input overall the class isn't bad.
4427,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,"Only 3 exams and they are all essays, on top of that you will have to read a boring book to do a book project on which is another essay. Not very clear on instructions. Horrible professor. Literally gave me a low grade because I was short on words, didnt say anything about the quality of my essay at all."
4428,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor ever. This is a history class and prof Botson graded this as a composition course. He had VERY UNCLEAR grading criteria and direction. If you are bad at writing, please do not take him."
4429,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Great knowledgeable professor. Took him for HIST 1301 and 1302. People complained that he was difficult and that tests were hard. They were easy if you did even minimal reading. Just show up and take notes. Only does lectures, which are actually useful. Would definitely recommend. Easy A for me."
4430,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,Professor Boston is not good at all he will make you read a bunch of boring information on material that you wont even be tested on and make you prepare for 6 possible essay questions on the tests that he wont even give you enough information on in class to write about.
4431,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,5.0,DO NOT SKIP ONE SINGLE CLASS! Prepare to take notes. He does not use a power point presentation. Everything is oral presentation. You have to be focused on what he says. Recording his classes is prohibited. He is an amazing professor!
4432,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,I feel cheated that I could not attend his classes in person after COVID messed eveythng up! He made connections so very simple through his amazing storeis. I could listen to him talk forever and not be bored. He is a remarkable teacher and a true genius.
4433,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,Best History professor. Took him for History 1301 and taking him again for 1302. Just listen and take notes you will be fine. Not too many homeworks.
4434,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,Professor Botson made history so easy and fascinating. Attendance is a MUST. Book is a must. A lot of reading and essays BUT as long as you read and attend his classes EASY A. Must know what youre writing about. 3 tests &amp; essay exams. BOOK REPORT. Offers EXTRA CREDIT. Must realize that history involves a lot of writing. Welcome to college.
4435,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,3.0,4.0,"First quiz of the class I didnt pass. Then professor Botson says to the class, whoever here didnt pass the quiz will most likely not make a passing grade in the class. No encouragement, no nothing about how one can do better next time. I felt like he set us up for failure and I didnt feel like I had what it takes to pass, so I dropped the class."
4436,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"Fair teacher, he gives reviews for all the tests so you know what to study. Tries to make his lectures as interesting as possible, but honestly weren't"
4437,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely LOVE professor Botson. I hate history and he made me love it so much. He is very caring towards his students and makes sure everyone understands the lectures. He lectures a lot, but he lectures in a way that is very interesting and relatable to the students. Students always participate and we always have discussions about the lectures."
4438,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Energetic and funny professor, makes history fun to learn! Syllabus is straightforward and sticks to it. If you go to class and arrive ON TIME or earlier, because he starts lecturing exactly on time, take notes, read the chapters/books assigned you will pass. He also gives Extra Credit opportunities! I had a great experience and learned a lot!"
4439,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,Professor Botson is amazing! I've taken him for both 1301 and 1302 because I just absolutely love his class. He is very nice and gets students easily interested in history. He has 3 tests and 2 books exams but they are very easy if you pay attention to the lectures. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
4440,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! I took him for both 1301 and 1302. 1302 was more challenging because of all the reading but still if you do the work, easy A. His study guides are the test exactly which was extremely helpful. Lectures are interesting as he has a great sense of humor and you can tell he knows his stuff and is passionate about it. NO homework!!"
4441,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,Really great professor! Really breaks it down and teaches you. Easy A if you show up. Offers extra credit as well.
4442,438250,Michael,Botson,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"You must the books! theres a wrold map quiz in the beginning, extra credit provided at the hcc reel, if available?

4451,798171,Linda,Adkinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,EGLS3,5.0,5.0,She is really a nice person and she cares about what you learn from her class. If you work hard you would receive a good grade.
4452,798171,Linda,Adkinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2314,5.0,1.0,"There are no words to describe how great of a professor Linda Dowliis. She goe above and beyond to help you understand the material. I took her for introductio and I made an A . It was a lot of reading and studying, but doable. If you enroll in his class you will NOT regret it. Her lectures are interesting, gives extra credit if needed, etc."

4457,798171,Linda,Adkinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2314,4.0,3.0,She gives good lectures and shows slides based off the printed notes she gives.

4464,798171,Linda,Adkinson,Houston Community College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2316,5.0,2.0,"Professor makes you want to come to class, attendance is necessary to pass, you will learn a lot. Class is simple to pass as long as you come to class and want to learn."
4466,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,3.0,3.0,"I took this professor in summer 2020 semester the first 5 weeks for ENGL 1302, because I picked a professor based on ethnicity that should be good and kind, but I haven't looked up on her rating before I enrolled. Her online English class is kind of okay; I got a C from her on my first essay, which I should've picked other professor than this."
4467,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL13011302,4.0,3.0,Shes a pretty good teacher. I enjoyed her classes and although there was always a lot of work (and I mean A LOT) it wasnt too bad. Make sure to read the books listed in the syllabus because sometimes youll have to write lengthy papers on them and summaries wont cut it.
4468,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"So my advisor told me to email her because she was a month late on grading our essays for her to at least give us a rough estimate of our grades on the paper. But guess what she replied back? ""I don't know, I'm not a math teacher."" Like, who does that????? And her assignments have little to no correlation to English, I would never take her class"
4469,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,3.0,Very poor communication through this covid-19 ordeal. This has resulted in quite the headache when taking her class. I would NOT recommend you take her course if you could care less and social charged issues that have NOTHING to do with English literature. There was very little instruction on even the very basic level of fundamental writing. Run.
4470,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,4.0,I took her online assuming it would be an easy A. I love writing essays I always get A . Well she gave me my first C. I sent her an email if I could see her ( office hours) Bc she didnt correct anything. Just an over all from 3 parts. Im taking it again w/ some one else. She may be good in person. Not online. What a regret.
4471,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,1.0,5.0,"Don't take her, just don't!!!"
4472,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,the worst professor I have ever had. she is something else.
4473,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,5.0,"Be aware of this professor, she is tough grader I have ever taken. Her grades are not predicted, and sometimes you can get high or low scores with no reasons."
4474,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"I wouldve given her less than 1 star if there is such a thing but unfortunately there isnt. What an absolute waste of my time. Grading is a joke. Rude and uncommunicative. Do not take her even if shes the last instructor available, not worth the stress."
4475,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor in HCC. Shouldnt take her class if you do not want to risk with your GPA. Moreover, I think all of the positive comments in this website about her was write by herself. You can see 22 good comments in just 1 day 07/03/2017. Maybe she do it to improve her rate but it is not right. Never take her class with any reason."
4476,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,She is a tough grader but only because she believes in students having to try their best in each course. She responds quickly to emails as long as you follow her guidelines. You will be doing a lot of writing and reading with a group presentation but her class was a lot of fun. She is very knowledgable in many subjects.
4477,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,2.0,4.0,She is a tough grader. No matter what you do it is almost impossible to get a 100. I do not recommend her to anyone.
4478,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,5.0,"In all seriousness, it should actually be illegal to allow people to teach a college class as poorly as Maryann Nguyen. Most frustrating, stressful teacher Ive had. Tons of homework, no clear instructions, no rubric, no explanation of missing points, no response to email, makes up new stuff to count off every time to avoid giving 100s. The worst!"
4479,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"What a nightmare. Honestly I never thought that I would be struggling in English, which is supposed to be a relatively easier class than others. No grading criteria, no feedback, nothing at all. Very horrible. DO NOT, I REPEAT, NOT TAKE HER ONLINE CLASS."
4480,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,5.0,"she is an awful person, doesn't know what she wants , no clear grading criteria. not respectful instructor."
4481,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"she expects the students to be able to write as an English professor. She wants us to be respectful, but the articles and the videos she gives us to write about doesn't support that at all. She never gives you the feeling that she cares about you. In addition the grading criteria she follows is so stupid, she take so many points for silly reasons."
4482,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"Honestly the worst online teacher ever. Her grading criteria is not clear at all. She seems all over the place. I do not recommend taking her at all. Very very tough grader, she expects us to write as if we were authors. Too much writing for an online class. Just terrible."
4483,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,4.0,"Honestly the worst professor you can have. Not only takes a month to grade an assignment which should take about a week, but also has a nonsensical and patronizing way of grading your assignments? Forget to put an in-text citation? She marks your whole essay as plagiarism and gives you an F. If you can, try and get Satan as a professor instead."
4484,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1302,1.0,5.0,Waaaaaaay too much work for an online class. Do not take her online class.
4485,1685309,Maryann,Nguyen,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"Super tough grader and I do not understand her grading system at all. She seems all over the place, and you learn via TEDTalks. Some of the articles she wants you to discuss are from sources she says are unreliable. She doesn't explain anything at all. An actual nightmare."
4487,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,1.0,5.0,DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. He is so rude and when you have a question and ask him he is rude and he don't want to explain if he already explained. When you will do the exam you need to use lockdown browser with cam.
4488,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2302,3.0,5.0,"Probably the hardest class I've taken in HCC. I had a bit of a prob but he communicated with us and solved it. He's pretty okay, at first he seems scary but towards the end of the semester he lightens up. He teaches well. The only problem is studying for the test. It's a lot! 6 chapters for each test and there are 3 in total. It's hard work!"
4489,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,5.0,3.0,Hands down hes the best professor ever. He is really knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches.
4490,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,5.0,2.0,Best professor I've ever taken. Makes the lecture really interesting. Made me love economics and even consider doing it as a major. By far the best professor in the economics department. Exams are based on exactly what he goes over in class. You don't have to read the book. Just pay attention to his lecture.
4491,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301AND2,5.0,3.0,"Hes a great guy, very funny and caring. Take really good notes, economics is not an easy subject but he will try to explain it until you get it. Study hard! Exams are over material done in class. If you have questions reach out to him."
4492,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,3.0,3.0,"Mineman is amazing when it comes to his robust lectures, along being one of the better professors. However, DO NOT COME to his class if you expect it to be a breeze. DOES NOT OFFER EXTRA CREDIT NOR DROP LOWEST TEST GRADE. TWO TESTS AND 1 FINAL. TAKE NOTES, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION,ASK QUESTIONS, and you'll pass. Lastly folks, study study study!!!"
4493,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2301,5.0,3.0,"This Professor is amazing. He makes the class very interesting, fun, and gives real life examples that makes easy to understand the material. It is extremely important to attend class, pay attention, and take notes!!!If you do, then you won't have a problem passing the class and you will learn a lot. One of the best professors I have ever had!"
4494,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2304,5.0,2.0,"The best econ professor in all of the infinite universes! He dumbs it down so you can understand the concept of econ without relying to heavily on the usage of charts. I took him for one semester for macro and now am currently enrolled in UH taking micro if it wasnt for him i would be totally lost, a shame I couldnt take him again. TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!"
4495,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,5.0,3.0,He is the best.
4496,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2302,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I've ever had! I came into his class not knowing a single thing about macro, so I was very scared to take on micro. However, since day one, I've easily followed the class, I attended all his lectures, and his tests are very relevant to what he teaches! I highly recommend Professor Mineman. He is fair, funny, and easy to understand."
4497,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON1302,5.0,2.0,"Amazing Professor,his lectures are easy to understand and are detailed. HE GIVES EXTRA CREDIT,honestly all i did was sit in the class and participate and it payed off i made 95's on the first 2 exams,I studied very little. It helps to pay attention in class and participate, which is also extra credit. Great Professor, take him you wont regret it!!"
4498,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2301,5.0,2.0,"1 quiz, 2 exams and final, pay attention for the bonus questions. Take good notes, study the reviews and do the homework. He explain everything very well and gives plenty of opportunities to ask questions. He is a gem at this school."
4499,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2301,5.0,1.0,Best professor for economics!!!!!
4500,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,MICRO2302,5.0,5.0,"Prof Mineman is a great professor, he is funny and knows his stuff. I don't like economics but he breaks it down in the simplest way. You have to attend class or you'll miss a good chunk of the test, study and read a lot!"
4501,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,MACRO1,4.0,3.0,"He understands that not everyone going to become economists. Do your homework, study your notes for your exams. Enjoy the class."
4502,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,5.0,2.0,Great professor! Explains all the concepts throughly. Barely had to look into the textbook because all concepts were grasped through the lecture. Willing to answer any question that you are confused about even if it's not directly related to the topic at hand. Exams and quizzes are easy A's if you grasp concepts. Definitely would recommend!
4503,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2302,5.0,2.0,This professor is a really good teacher. He has an engaging and energetic lecturing style and always has interesting real-world stories to clarify the concepts. He does assign online homework and so you will have to pay $150 if you want to or not. The homework does help though but it's better to start early. Tests are difficult but not impossible.
4504,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2301,5.0,1.0,"If you suck at econ take him. He explains everything in it's simplest form. Two exams and a final. Maybe one pop quiz. You are required to purchase an online code to do the homework, but its worth it-- taking him than some hard teacher."
4505,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,5.0,3.0,Mr Ed is an amazing teacher.. please do take him Everything comes from the notes aand if u study them well its an easy B class but if you put extra effort then A is not tough to achieve Over all amazing and highly recommended
4506,614040,Ed,Mineman,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,5.0,2.0,"I am a UT Austin graduate and I have to say, he was one of the best professors I have ever had. His classes, while super informative and engaging, are also full of practical business/economic/life advice. If you do the homework and study, I would say this is an easy A. If I could, I would definitely take one of his classes again."
4508,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,3.0,Great Professor! Very understanding and gives additional time too catch up. Was extremely supportive during the Covin crisis. Professor Harrison is always available by email and cell phone. She responds almost immediately.
4509,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,4.0,3.0,"This class was easy, but don't get me wrong! You have to put lots of effort. Her quizzes are based on readings and long TED talk videos and youtube videos. It can be tricky if you're not paying attention! She drops the lowest grade and there's not any tests! Just projects and essay! She's great with responding and helping!"
4510,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,4.0,4.0,"I took her for her hybrid class but then due to covid 19 we went completely online which was fine. Quizzes are not easy, you do have to read/watch videos. Given 2 chances on each quiz. Drops lowest grades on discussions and quizzes. Not meant for slackers. 1 essay and group project. Work hard and you'll pass. She's nice and funny. Take her!"
4511,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,2.0,"This professor is Great! I took her Hybrid class and she is clear and concise. She even gives time to catch up. Her quizzes are easy brezzy, and we had no Final Exam if your grade was good overall. She also drops lowest grades. I would take her again! Shes fair and a great teacher. Easy A!"
4512,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,3.0,"She is the best professor iv'e ever had. She gives us back feedback from our discussions which allows us to become better, she also is very understanding."

A really interesting class, lots of discussion. She makes you work, but it's not hard to make good grades if you do it. Don't miss the chance to take her class"
4514,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,3.0,I absolutely loved Professor Harrisons Humanities Class! Her lectures were interesting and very engaging! Shes very understanding and cares about every student! Also great for international students if you have language barriers she will work with you to the best of her ability! Take her class its totally worth it
4515,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ESOL0360,5.0,3.0,She is the best teacher and helps her students be good writers. I take her class to learn more about English writing in college and she taut me a lot about writing many essays.
4516,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,3.0,"She is the best professor that I have ever had and her class is interesting and makes you think about the world. She makes you work, but you can get good grade if you do the work and keep up. Not to hard."

4520,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,2.0,An amazing professor. Would definitely take her again.
4521,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ENGL1301,1.0,2.0,"She's a good person, but totally no a good teacher. Learned nothing there."
4522,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,2.0,5.0,"I have to say that If you're a native-English speaker, then ignore my comment. She's cool, knowledgable, and nice. However, be awarded tons of readings and videos (difficult level), you have to work three to four times than others to get a good grade. She won't let you click the ""previous button"" in your online test. I'm so regretful 4 this class."
4523,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,2.0,Amazing and very captivating professor! I was intimidated and doubtful about taking this class because of the essay portion of the exams but it was worth it! Love her personality! Professor Harrison made me feel that I am getting my educational worth at a community college
4524,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,HUMA1301,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Lee is one of my favorite professors ever. In the hybrid course you'll be doing weekly online hw, quizzes over the hw in class, and some online quizzes. The HW is doable last minute, and you'll pass the quizzes as long as you did most of the HW or read summaries over some of the readings lol. As a lazy student I actually enjoyed this class"
4525,496198,Diana Lee,Harrison,Houston Community College (all campuses),English,ESOL0369,5.0,2.0,She is best ever professor in HCC! She helps her students all the time and her class not hard if student come to class and do work. I will always remember this professor when I go to other classes.

4529,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,1.0,"An amazing instructor, explained every thing you need to know clearly. those student writing (don't take him again, they did not read or listen to this professor, they want to pass without an effort. guy it's called school, you have to read and ask question.) this professor is not one of those instructor that do not care about his student,he does."
4530,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,3.0,3.0,"He can be arrogant. Ask him a question about the material for clarification, he'll tell you not to over analyze, which is condescending. 200 question exam review but barely anything from it on the exam. Better to take notes from his lecture and study from those. Exam questions are poorly worded/designed. I appreciated his live video lectures."
4531,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,1.0,"He is an angel, you will learn and have good grade too .TAKE HIM"
4532,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2320,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Kay is an amazing professor. If students leave a poor rating here it is likely because they did not reach out to Dr. Kay or simply made a bad grade in the course and didn't try. It is, for all, MICROBIOLOGY. You have to try. Dr. Kay always asks if the class has any questions. He is really passionate and makes himself available one-on-one."
4533,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2301,1.0,2.0,"Extremely disorganized &amp; inconsistent. Lecture/lab consists of him rambling in class. Do not expect to learn or truly comprehend concepts. Exams are 100 multiple choice question from bank of questions at the end of each chapter. If you want to actually learn, do not take him. If you are looking for mind-numbing class, go for it. I regret the class."
4534,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,4.0,4.0,Professor Njemanze is really good professor. He explains gis lecture very detailed and tries to answer all questions. He knows that there are a huge amount of materials students need to cover so he does not pressure students by giving homework or group project. Very respected and intelligent!
4535,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2320,3.0,3.0,"He is never boring and always ties in what we are learning about to the real world . Notes are helpful along with manual but there is always stuff on the test that I feel were not discussed about in class. We had 4 exams , a district final and a class final as well as a paper in the beginning of semester. Super easy though!"
4536,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2120,5.0,1.0,"I also took Dr. Kay for lab... little bit tougher to bounce back from but ONLY because we had 1 mid term, and 1 final. That was IT. The test were very clear, you just had to pay attention and know what you were doing in lab to pass with an A. No extra credit or work."
4537,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Kay is amazing. If this is going to be your only ""tough class"" for a given semester then it'll be a piece of pie! Just pay attention to lecture, study with his manual, and don't miss class often! His Lecture was a hoot! Loved it!"
4538,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,5.0,1.0,"There are 4 exams, lowest grade get dropped, one comprehensive final, and district final, so 6 exams total. You buy the manual ,and study that for the exams. Also, use quizlet to help you get more information. Microbiology lecture is an amazing class ,and so informative. Take really good notes in the class to do well."
4539,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,1.0,The best instuctor in Houston community college ever.
4540,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,5.0,2.0,The best professor at HCC period.
4541,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,1.0,Take him and youll never regret it. He cares soo much about his students he takes his time to lecture so everyone can understand. Hes the best you can ever have.
4542,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BILO2320,5.0,1.0,One of the best instructor in Hcc
4543,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,2.0,"I never actualIy rate professors but he is literally one of the BEST professors I have ever had in my life. He has an amazing personality and makes learning very interesting! As long as you study I dont see HOW you would fail! He will work with you as well, he WANTS you to succeed unlike most of these professors. Take him and you wont regret it."
4544,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2301,5.0,3.0,"Best professor, and very very helpful. Gives a handbook with what we really need for his class instead of reading a big book. And how detailed he is when explaining is a PLUS. Very helpful and always willing to spend extra time with students so they can be successful in class"
4545,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,5.0,3.0,Awesome Professor. I will be taking other classes with him. He is easy to follow because he breaks it down for you to understand.
4546,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2320,5.0,4.0,Dr. Njemanze really breaks down his lectures in detail so students fully understand the subject matter. He is very knowledgeable about all aspects of microbiology (including biochem!). Lectures are enjoyable and the professor encourages students to ask questions. If you study hard you will pass this class!
4547,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2120,5.0,2.0,"I took him during summer 5 weeks. You only have 1 test (comprehensive final) which is 50 written questions and you have 2 do two stains that he tells you in advance. He is very funny and caring, if you are confused or cant get a stain just ask him or email him and he will help you. You dont have any hw and participation matter. Studying  A."
4548,936855,Harold Kay,Njemanze,Houston Community College (all campuses),Biology,MICRO2420,5.0,2.0,I took his micro lecture in the summer 5 weeks &amp; he made it interesting &amp; fun. For lecture you have 4 exams &amp; each 100 mc questions &amp; you have a comprehensive final and a district test. He gives you questions that could be asked on the test. If you dont understand something ask him or email him. Just study and you should pass with an A.
4550,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"He is a funny professor who gives great feedback. however, it's not easy to get an A in this class. you write 4 essays, 16 ch. quizzes, 4 quizzes based on the book he assigns (answers are not online) so Read the book! 4 DB's that are like mini essays, you really have to give a well researched and though out statement, not just a vague paragraph."
4551,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Prof Ramey is awesome. Took his 8 week online class for summer, and while it was a lot of participation, it wasn't hard to keep up with. It was well organized and his Historical Fiction assignment was actually FUN! Yes, a FUN assignment! In History class! He is caring and funny. Not an EASY A, but follow instructions and turn in work. You'll be ok!"
4552,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"He is nice, understanding, and provides very good feedback. However, in an 8-week class, you have to submit 4 discussions, 4 essays (one of them min 7 pg), have to read 2 books, take a quiz (very easy) for each chapter, and attend a weekly online conference. He's also an extremely tough grader. Not at all easy to get A (discussions &amp; essays)."
4553,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Ramey was great! I really enjoyed his class! He's funny and respected. His workload is nothing too crazy. Just short weekly 8 question quizzes. 2 major grade essay, and a debate! I took him in person and then the rest online due to COVID-19. He's great online as well, he stays checking up on his class and engages with all his students!"
4554,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"I just took Prof Ramey for an 8-week online class. I have to say it was a bit challenging trying to fulfill all the readings and assignments. It's NOT the most difficult class I've taken, but it is intense. I suggest to not slack and keep up with the work. I enjoyed that he gives great feedback and overall was a great professor. Get ready to write."
4555,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"The best down to earth professor, i'm a senior now at UH and to this day he has been the best professor I have ever taken. I love him. he is straight up with you and genuine."
4556,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Take him! Take him! Take him! I took his online class which included chapter readings, chapter quizzes, 4 essays, and 4 discussion posts. At first glance, the assignments did seem overwhelming but it's manageable. The class did feel more like a writing class but I didn't mind. If you put in work and are a decent writer, you'll get an A!"
4557,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Hes not a though grader, his work was easy to be completely honest as long as you read (although some of the quizzes you can find on quizlet). He answers his emails really fast and not to mention he is really funny!"
4558,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic teacher, truly knowledgeable in his field."
4559,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"I took professor Ramey during summer 5 week course. I wish I took this class during a full semester. I enjoyed it that much. He class is a joy. He truly cares about his students, he will work with you if you need. He makes learning history fun. You can tell he is passionate about what he does. YOURE LUCKY IF YOU GET YOU GET TO TAKE THIS CLASS!!!"
4560,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,1301AND1302,5.0,2.0,"Took him both Summer Sessions in 2019; and he is simply one of the greatest US Hist professors you can take at HCC. Super funny, likeable, and all around, a humble being. Whether you're forming a dubious manner in need of a good professor; don't be. Because, what you're reading is worth your money and time. Do as I say and take him peeps :)"
4561,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor glad I took him this summer!
4562,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"He is the best History teacher EVER EVER TRUST ME!! He is super funny and make lectures very interesting! 6 major grades! DROP THE LOWEST! the grades are: Quizzes (3 questions, you answer one only you get 100 in the quiz) then a historical fiction paper which you will prob get an A in it. Then midterm and final based on lec. also, book essay! Esy A"
4563,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,Best history professor ever! Really chill professor assignments are easy except the midterm and final their challenging but other than that easy class take him!
4564,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,"i personally like him he is cool, but Guys this is a tough class, i know some of you might be like what is this guy talking about, but fine you will see it and you will find this comment useful. you have to create your own midterm and final, do a 500+ pages book analysis, essay, every other day a quiz, i was thinking the same like you all good luck"
4565,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HISTORY1301,4.0,2.0,Amazing professor....I would most definitely take him again!
4566,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HISTORY1301,4.0,4.0,"OMG! This is an Amazing professor and he is so knowledgeable, he can lecture and never pick up a book. I really enjoyed his class. I took him in the summer session I at 8:00a.m. and I did not fall asleep. He is hilarious and if you do not mind him swearing you will do good in his class."
4567,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"You have the option to drop your lowest grade if you choose not to do an assignment. We had 1 group project which was a debate and just do the work and you will pass. He is not a hard grader. We had 2 test midterm and final. We had small readings each week for a 3 question quiz, you only have to get 1 answer right to get a 100. TAKE HIM!!!!"
4568,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,He is an awesome professor. He is really funny and likes to joke around and make his lectures interesting. He has a clear grading criteria and he genuinely cares for his students. Definitely take him.
4569,1624101,Michael,Ramey,Houston Community College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,BEST HIST1301 PROFFESSOR. TAKE HIM!!!!!
4571,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"He was an amazing professor, always helpful and quick to answer emails. I would Definitely take him again."
4572,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1314,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Dillon is very knowledgeable in his field. He has made great use of technology to convey an accurate and intelligible lecture during COVID. If you are serious about your grade and it is reflective in your participation and attendance, you will be recognized and will pass. He genuinely cares if you care. Exam reviews provided. Great instructor."
4573,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1314,5.0,2.0,"Professor Dillon really cares about his students! Being a dual credit student, I was really nervous to start college but he made my experience better. He is an easy teacher who gives you partial credit and makes sure you understand every single step. I finished with an A on the class.I guarantee you will pass if you do his online homework!"
4574,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,3.0,Thomas is a very good teacher. He encourage you to do good in the course and he takes care of your neeeds as a student . I recommend you to take class with him he would of work with you to pass his class.
4575,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1342,3.0,4.0,"I took Professor Dillon for statistics. He mentioned it had been years since he had taught the subject so he would always get confused throughout the lecture. He came off rude many times throughout the semester to students, which I did not like. He assigned a project last minute without it being on the syllabus which was so frustrating!"
4576,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,4.0,Great professor!! Makes math so easy.
4577,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,4.0,2.0,"One of the best teachers I've had. He is very patient and understanding to your needs. he gives you the opportunity to make up missed test and gives constructive feedback if you are willing to learn and understand the material. If you take Math 1314, look up Prof. Tom Dillon, awesome dude!!"
4578,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"He is very intelligent. He knows what he teaches, which is different from most teachers. He was really eager to teach and tried hard to let students know what he was teaching. It is worthwhile taking his class if a student wants to learn algebra."
4579,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,1.0,"i took calculus by Tom. He is a really nice professor. teaching is clear. tests are very easy, gives chance to get some extra credits.  but online assignment is hard for some excellent students who want more challenge. I got A+ from him. He relates your material to some carriers, very helpful. High recommend if u plan major in Engineering ."
4580,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,1.0,"Really good Professor, as a teacher and in person. Have makes ups for most test and clearly understands your priorities. Had skip one test due to student conference and he let me take a make test. I would totally recommend him for Calculus due to his clearity. His notes are electronic so they are available to student at any time they want it."
4581,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,2.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER. HELPFUL AND EASY IF YOU WANT TO PASS. JUST HAVE YOUR FULL ATTENTION IN CLASS AND TRUST ME YOU WILL DEFINITELY PASS. HE IS FUNNY, MAKES CLASS VERY INTERESTING AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET TASKING THIS PROFESSOR. I'M DRIVING ALL THE WAY FROM COLLEGE STATION TO TAKE THIS PROFESSOR SO IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA HOW BAD ASS HE IS."
4582,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,4.0,2.0,"He was cool, came in late a lot though, but he works a lot (works in Clear Lake then drives to Stafford for class). I personally found the class dull because I knew the information before hand so I played games on my phone and passed with a B. This was a 10 week course but it felt so long and dragged out because its 5 chapters in 10 weeks."
4583,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1314,4.5,4.0,Good teacher kept interest throughout class
4584,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,Very good teacher. He gives all students every opportunity to be successful. If you fail this class it's because you did not try or pay attention. Do the work and go to class and you will pass.
4585,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,Professor Dillon was enthusiastic about math and very knowledgable. He was concerned about us knowing the material. Good math teacher!
4586,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,"Wonderful professor, his class was very easy. I really recommend him if you want to pass this class."
4587,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0312,4.5,2.0,He is a nice guy. I like his teaching method. Best math professor I ever had. He will make sure you understand math. I would recommend him in a heart beat!
4588,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0312,4.5,2.0,"He's a nice guy, I like his teaching method. I would recommend him in a heart beat."

4590,557983,Thomas,Dillon,Houston Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0312,4.0,2.0,"The best professor i ever had, I love the way he explains the problems, I never likes math before but with him I had changed my mind..I recommend him to anyone who wants to succeed in math"
4592,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,5.0,4.0,"This is the second time I'm taking his class. Took Macroeconomy before and this time Microeconomy online. Textbooks are free and he explains a lot of materials through his lectures that are very helpful. If you study for this class, take the quizzes you will get a good grade."
4593,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,5.0,4.0,His classes are interactive with real life scenarios. He does lesson short videos for better understanding. There is homework for every lesson and he gives second chances if needed for a better grade so if you are dedicated to your classes you won't have any problem. I really enjoyed the class with Prof. Gosselin!
4594,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,5.0,3.0,Professor Gosselin is the most understandable professor I had so far. He will give you chances to get your best grade. I always receive a response from him in less than 24 hrs. His assignments are easy if you follow the instructions provided and read the lecture. The evaluations are fair and he provides different learning methods.
4595,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ACCT2301,5.0,1.0,"I was on the verge on failing the class and he made it his goal to help his class pass. He gave us extra credit, study guides, tips on taking the exam. He is honestly the best professor Ive had at HCC in the 2 years Ive been here."
4596,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2302,2.0,3.0,"He gave us a review for the first two midterm exams but for the final, he told us to look for 41 vague concepts in the book, quizzes, past exams and videos posted on Canvas. The only good thing about this course was that the book was free and you will have to pay 12 dollars for 'MyMobLab' to play childish games which don't really help for the exam"
4597,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2302,2.0,4.0,"If you have a question about a quiz question, and you happened to get it right, but ask him for further explanation, he will insult your intelligence by claiming you got the right answer by googling it. Also, if you happen to pick a wrong answer on his Socrative assignments, he will call you dumb. He wasted lecture days on pointless assignments."
4598,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2302,2.0,4.0,Sometimes his answer choices on the quiz are not right. He will claim you did not read the book if you can't answer his questions (a small nitpick where each chapter is 20 pages long) in class right away. His lectures were maybe two or three days behind the chapter quizzes due date. He will mark your answers wrong if you got it right.
4599,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,1.0,5.0,"I can not stress this enough, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! He expects you to learn this hard terms on your own and when it comes to test time basically tricks you with questions. Class averages were the lowest I've ever seen in an online class. He also doesn't reply to emails regarding anything. If you don't want to lower your gpa, don't take this class"
4600,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,2.0,4.0,Just wow. Wish he would've had more accurate reviews prior to taking his course. He is extremely heavy on reading and if economics is not your thing it can get boring very quickly. He will ask that you read for hours outside his class.
4601,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,2.0,4.0,This class aint it bro. The class is way too hard and he makes you have lockdown webcam testing.
4602,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,1.0,4.0,This professor seems to not care about his students. No extra credit and reviews are completely different from tests. His exams are extremely difficult. Finding a different professor for Econ 2302.
4603,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,1.0,4.0,very hard class that shouldn't be this hard. you need to put a lot of effort and time into. if you have a heavy schedule dont take this class. he expects you to invest a lot of time into this class outside of school. he gives reviews for tests but they are nothing like test. overall wouldn't recommend. good luck
4604,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,3.0,4.0,"This professor knows what he's talking about in econ and you can learn allot from his lectures and courses also he saves you big bucks on school resources such as an online book, wallstreet journal, and moblab that ended up costing me maybe 20 bucks. He's very resourceful and if you're a student who is willing to put in time for the class take it."
4605,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2302,3.0,3.0,"Took online in a 8 week course. Lots of reading since you do 2 chapters a week, and have to read articles that he links as well. Lockdown Browser Exam every other week, drops your lowest one. Low cost class, I spent about $22 (book is available in PDF, you sign up for moblab &amp; wall street journal). Only had one essay assignment 200-500 words."
4606,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO2302,3.0,3.0,"I don't want to rate this Prof down, he is a very respected and cool. But when it comes to real ECON matters he can not deliver the lecture efficiently, he understands the material but can't make you understand. He lectures more about minor things rather than real ECON lectures. Quizzes are absolutely out of context and soooooo confusing."
4607,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,1.0,5.0,"Took him online and had to email him weekly because he would post the wrong assignments or he wouldn't post them at all. Didn't hear one positive thing about this professor (according to people who were taking the same course with me at the time). There is a lot of work, and reading. Be prepared to be on top of things."
4608,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Gosselin was a good instructor. With good study habits, you can manage to get an A. A vast majority of the assignments are online, practically an assignment due every week. His lectures are amazing but READ BEFORE CLASS! The exams are NOT easy, but practice the material, do the reviews, find a study group, and you'll enjoy his class."
4609,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,5.0,4.0,Great professor that makes you think and shows the relevance of economics in your day to day. Lots of homework and lectures.
4610,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,4.0,4.0,"He is really nice, but the class is pretty difficult. You have to try your best or you will not do well. Do not expect an easy ""A"" with Prof. Gosselin."
4611,245045,Richard,Gosselin,Houston Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON2301,4.0,4.0,"I wanted to drop after 2wks. Fortunately, he changed the exam process after the cataclysmic 2nd exam. He gave us, then, review questions and made us take the test in class. Which was better than using the responduapp. (If u'r still struggling in English avoid him online). I appreciated that he tried to make the class not dull with many activities."
4612,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUSN207,3.0,2.0,"Overall, she was a decent professor. As long as I followed the instructions for each assignment, I received an A. She does have different guidelines from the syllabus; however, she makes her guidelines known in weekly announcements. Follow the directions, and you will pass her class."
4613,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUS101,3.0,5.0,"Shes ok, boring, makes it hard to understand at times, and theres lots of homework w short deadline"
4614,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BOAT216,1.0,4.0,This class was the most confusing online class I've ever taken. Every thing the teacher said contradicted or completely ignored the syllabus. There was also very little communication between her and the class. No one in the class knew what assignments to do and it didn't help that she never graded anything until the last minute. Awful
4615,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUS101,2.0,4.0,"VERY boring lectures, honestly wanted to drop out just because of how boring she is. She tells you the bare minimum and you are not allowed to use your computer in class."
4616,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUS101,2.0,3.0,"Felt a lack of experience in this class. She flips through powerpoints and reads them, as if the students can't already read them...."
4617,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUSN101,3.0,4.0,"This course covers a wide range of business related subjects (marketing, economics, human resource, accounting, etc.) We had a lot of homework. Also, don't be surprised to have homework deadlines the same week of the midterm exam. It was not a difficult class, but there were too many assignments on top of quizzes and discussion board."
4618,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUS101,1.0,4.0,She will make sure you do not get an A.
4619,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUS101,5.0,4.0,I am grateful for teaching me  she has inspired me to follow my dreams and be a success in my life
4620,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,CINS101,1.0,5.0,She is a terrible instructor she made me feel as though she did not want to help me.I felt very lost being a beginner. She taught the class as if it were advanced.
4621,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,OFAD216,1.0,3.0,"There is very little communication and less direction.  Emails and phone calls are rarely returned.  I spoke to her once.  She was very nice, but not very helpful."
4622,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUS101,3.5,1.0,professor Leverette is more than sufficient at what she does. she sometimes confuses you with how she operates her learning plan but it's nothing serious. the textbook is nearly irrelevant since she posts chapter powerpoints on blackboard that will be all you need. she is however very polite.
4623,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,OFAD216,4.5,2.0,This teacher was very helpful to me!! I had to transfer from in class to online in the middle of the semester and she made the transfer easy. As long as you do the work and communicate with her then I am sure you will get a good grade!
4624,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,OFAD216,2.0,4.0,"I took this course in the summer and online. Professor was non-responsive for first four and last two weeks of class.  Emails went unanswered, papers were printed and mailed to the wrong address (a week after I needed to know how to improve my writing), and most of the class withdrew, presumably because nobody could figure out what was going on."
4625,829384,Debra,Leverette,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Business Administration,BUS101,5.0,4.0,"Excellent, caring instructor."
4630,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,3.0,Amazing teacher! She will teach you what you need to know! If if was an option I would choose her as my teacher for the whole program!
4631,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NSRG122,5.0,3.0,"Warner is GREAT! She has slight dry humor during lectures that had me laughing several times. She knows her stuff. For us with a bit of prior experience, she blew over what we knew and focused on items that were new to us. She cares about you learning, Shes approachable, carrying, and nice. I wish she could just teach us the entire time."
4632,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG115,5.0,3.0,"Warner is really great in the aspect that she teaches what you'll use in the field, she takes what we need to know, and modifies it so that it will actually be useful and so that we will be successful nurses instead of just textbook nurses. She uses that experience to really help and I learned a lot of useful tips from her."
4633,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG115,5.0,3.0,Wow! What a great teacher! She was inspirational and really cared about her students.
4634,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG115,5.0,3.0,"She is amazing. She is very realistic, very knowledgeable, and extremely motivational. She genuinely cares about the success of her students and does all she can do relieve the pressure of awkward students learning their way around the nursing field. If you get her for lab, you've hit the jackpot!"
4635,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,4.0,Warner is an amazing instructor. She has a wealth of experience and knowledge to draw from. Shes genuinely interested in helping her students become competent nurses. She goes above and beyond to help students inside and outside of the classroom. One of the top instructors in the nursing program.
4636,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG115,5.0,3.0,"Warner is THE BEST! Loved having her for lab. Looked forward to every single week. She is funny and I learned more from her than I did from anyone else my first semester. I wish she could teach every one of my courses! That said----DO NOT SHOW UP UNPREPARED FOR CLASS. You would think that is a no-brainer, but you'd be wrong."
4637,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG115,4.0,4.0,"Overall great professor! She really wants you to do well, and from what I've heard from other students, compared to other professors she's a little more laid back on certain rules. Loved having her for lab."
4638,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG115,5.0,3.0,"I had Warner for lab, &amp; she is one of the two best nursing faculty members. She knows EVERYTHING. She can teach you anything with ease. She has seen/done it all, &amp; she has amazing experience to pull from tot each with. Warner also has THE BEST lecture materials &amp; spends REAL TIME on what she is going to teach. Wish she could teach me everything!"
4639,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG100,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher,"
4640,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG115,5.0,4.0,"I currently had Warner in lab. She is genuinely interested in us learning, teaches us med surg lectures, and is easily my favorite professor. She teaches based off of real experiences and tells relevant stories while staying focused on the material. She even covers materials for our lectures so we aren't lost and confused where other teachers lack."
4641,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NURG105,1.0,5.0,She is not informative as a clinical instructor. She doesn't know what she is doing at the hospital. She is better at lecture only.
4642,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,1.0,"Wonderful teacher. Certainly hard on her students, though she just wants you to learn and gain greater understanding. She is an instructor that you can look up to and someone whom you truly don't want to disappoint."
4643,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Warner is an amazing instructor!! She is clear and gives you all the information you  need for the test. She asks questions and provides case studies to help increase your application of knowledge. Plus she is very kind and funny. Makes the class fun to come to.
4644,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,4.0,"Loved her!  She was intimidating at times, but it was for my own good!  She knows her stuff and cares about her students!"
4645,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG100,4.0,4.0,"I agree with the above comment: she's easy to talk to, funny, and very good at outlining the material she wants you to know and that you need to know.  She and Hacker are an awesome combo for MS I!"
4646,1689060,Laura,Warner,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,4.0,"Very nice, informative, and easy to talk to. Med/Surg is not easy but she teaches it well and gives excellent tips to help us remember the important stuff."
4648,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,1.0,She is the best teacher I have ever had. She will make sure you pass her Comm101 class.

4652,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,2.0,She is an excellent instructor! Honestly one of the best and most interesting I've had at Ivy Tech. Take her course - you won't regret it!
4653,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,4.0,She's a fabulous teacher! She gives you the tools to pass but you have to work for it! She gives very clear grading criteria and attending her class is mandatory. She gives amazing lectures and is very inspirational. Work hard and you will pass her class.
4654,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,3.0,Probably the most motivating and inspirational teacher I have ever had! I am a non-traditional student and was very nervous about speech class! Ended up being my favorite class that semester!!! If you're going to take speech at Ivy Tech TAKE HER CLASS!
4655,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,HUMA100,5.0,2.0,"Such a sweet, caring teacher."
4656,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've ever had! She's very passionate and funny, and talented."
4657,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,HUMA100,5.0,3.0,"One of the greatest teachers I've ever had. Truly a great educator! She's both passionate about the subject she teaches, and teaching the subject she loves. She does give homework just about every class, and some assignments require you to go to plays. So be prepared for that. However, you get the full experience and learn a broad range of topics!!"
4658,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,3.0,"Best teacher I've ever had, hands down."
4659,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. V is the best professor I have ever had! She is extremely committed to her students, and it really makes you feel like you can succeed; 15and you will! Public speaking is one of my biggest fears; yet she made this class my favorite thing to do out of my whole week. She has the book, and you can borrow it. I've learned so much taking her class!"
4660,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,2.0,"V is the best teacher you will ever have. If you're scared of public speaking this is the professor for you. You'll never meet a teacher who loves their job more. She honestly cares about each and every one of her students and proves it in all kinds of ways. Her class is personalized, interesting, and fun! Just make sure you don't miss it!"
4661,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,HUMA100,5.0,2.0,"Ms. V is a great teacher who really cares about her students. By giving her best, she inspires the best from her students. You will have to work in her class, but the assignments aren't just ""busy work""; every assignment was clearly designed to help students learn as much as possible in one short semester. "
4662,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,3.0,Ms. V is an amazing teacher.  She has taught me how to a great public speaker which helped me tremdously when i had to interview for a hospital program three times with 20 people sitting at the table.  I was able to fall back on the skills she taught me and make it through these interview and I was accepted to the hospital.  I would highly reccomed
4663,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,COMM101,5.0,3.0,Professor Vitosky-Staggs is one the most amazing teachers i have ever had the pleasure of having.  I cried during my first presentation due to anxiety of speaking in front of a group of people.  She turned me into a rock star by the end of the semester.  She is charismatic.  Professor Staggs is available to you by personal cell and email for help.
4664,1782679,Angela,Vitosky-Staggs,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Communication,HUMA100,5.0,1.0,"Ms. V is a fabulous teacher! A bit scatter-brained, but she grades faster than any of my other teachers. She knows her stuff and is very understanding in working things out (turning in things late, etc). Her enthusiasm really rubs off on her students! And you can't beat her chocolate chip cookies."
4666,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG111,5.0,3.0,"Sharkey was a great clinical instructor. He really wants you to succeed and is truly a great teacher. Not because he's ""easy"" - but because he will work with you to help you learn from your mistakes. He's not unreasonable either and will listen to your concerns. Definitely an instructor I won't forget during my time at Ivy Tech."
4667,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG106,5.0,4.0,"If you put in the effort, you will pass. His student notes are a life saver, attend each class and fill out your notes and you will pass."
4668,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG100,5.0,3.0,"Sharkey is a great instructor with lots of experience to pull from during lecture! He's hilarious and makes the subject matters very easy to understand. He has a great sense of humor and is very helpful outside of class as well! He is a stickler for attendence, although he doesn't TAKE attendence, he's definitely watching lol"
4669,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG106,5.0,4.0,He is absolutely amazing and I don't think I would've gotten though pharmacology if it weren't for him. He cares about his students. He explains things very well and teaches very well.
4670,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG100,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Sharkey is professional, kind and very knowledgeable. He manages to make lectures and demonstrations genuinely entertaining. He cares about all his students and treats us all with respect and consideration. Feel very lucky if you're assigned him as an instructor."
4671,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,PHARM101,5.0,4.0,Great teacher!
4672,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG106,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Sharkey is one of the best teachers I have had! I had him for multiple classes and he teaches in a way that is understandable, he assists you in the learning process and is available for help! His lectures are also very entertaining!"
4673,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,PHARM106,5.0,4.0,"I wish all my instructors had to take a course from him on teaching. Go to class!!!! He gives clear instructions and breaks down complex, overwhelming knowledge into easily understand facts. If you miss lecture then you will miss vast amounts of needed knowledge not just for your pharm grade, but for your nursing knowledge as a whole."
4674,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,CRN13223,4.0,3.0,"Very funny, expects  your best, and for you to participate in class discussions, He's very available for his students during and after class."
4675,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG106,5.0,4.0,"Mr. sharkey is really good and sets it up so you have all the information to study for the tests from his power points , so as long as you fill them out as he lectures and study them you'll be solid"
4676,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG106,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Sharkey is wonderful.  He gives you everything you need to succeed.  His lectures are spot on and he makes a dull subject entertaining.  Very practical in the way he teaches, which I find very helpful.  And you'll never be short of laughs during his class either.  BUT you have to show up, and be ready to work."
4677,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRUG126,5.0,5.0,"Professor Sharkey was the best professor I had at Ivy Tech. He helped me to review the exams very kindly, and he had so much patience for me.  I was very luck to learn from him."
4678,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NSRG100,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Sharkey is not only AWESOME, but he's so helpful and really makes what you're learning make sense and apply.  He's enthusiastic and makes sure everybody is getting the material.  I wish he taught more classes!"
4679,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG100,4.0,4.0,Mr. Sharkey is great! he tells wonderful stories and has enough real world experience to help you learn what it takes to be a good nurse.
4680,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,PHARM101,5.0,2.0,I've had him twice. He is a very genuine person. He gives you what you need but you better pay attention!
4681,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG106,5.0,3.0,"LOVE Mr. Sharkey! If you've been assigned, congratulations! He provides comic relief which is much appreciated for such a dry topic (pharmacology blah). Being in class is extremely helpful, his teaching style is black and white, and he will tell you exactly what he expects you to know."
4682,2045556,Randall,Sharkey,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG100,4.0,4.0,I enjoyed this instructor. Available outside of class when needed.
4684,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,3.0,"Ms Iyer was a great instructor for med surg 1. Definitely wishing we could have had her for med surg 2 as well! She was very down to earth and explained things well, and if a topic came up that she didn't know she was more than happy to look it up and get back with you! She was a great clinical instructor and teacher!"
4685,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,1.0,1.0,"Be prepared to teach yourself everything! The lectures are 95% fun sheets and/or case studies. The two profs (Iyer/Rayford) that co-teach the class are the most unorganized, unprepared instructors I've ever had. For the entire semester of MedSurg I, I may have taken a total of 2 pages of notes! There is absolutely no lecture at all!"
4686,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NUR102,4.0,3.0,"Good instructor overall. Show up for class, gives many participation quizzes you must be present for. Listen to voice overs and youll do well in her class. No surprises on exams, all info needed is given."
4687,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,3.0,Ms. Iyer is a younger teacher and that makes her more relateable. She is a sweetheart and definitely does her best to make sure everyone understands the material being presented. In the clinical setting she is very helpful and supportive. Ms Iyer is a great teacher with a great heart!
4688,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,2.0,4.0,"Mrs. Iyer was easily accessible in the clinical settings, and provided basic instruction in the classroom. She struggled being respectful to students and consistent with her evaluations. The breadth and scope of her knowledge was below that of other course instructors."
4689,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Iyer is such a great instructor! We were lucky enough to have her for lecture and clinical. She was pulled in every direction in the clinical setting and still found time to be helpful and give us all the attention we needed. Her lectures very much match what's on the test, so I always felt prepared. She's also just a total sweetheart."
4690,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG105,5.0,3.0,"Clinical this semester was a big learning experience - Mrs. Iyer went out of her way to get our class injection experiences , dressing change experiences and to round on us. I feel confident in my nursing skills moving forward to med surg 2 clinical."
4691,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NURSG102,1.0,1.0,Horrible teacher. The majority of her class is case studies and fun sheets with little to no teaching.
4692,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,4.0,4.0,Make sure you listen to voice over power points and come to class. Practice nclex questions were helpful.
4693,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,1.0,4.0,"I passed this class but I don't know how--luck? I felt lost and confused from Day 1 to the final. In other classes I takes pages and pages of notes; in this class I might write half a page because it's so random. Good luck figuring out what's on the exams. Unfortunately, my least favorite professor."
4694,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,1.0,4.0,Iyer has no idea what she is talking about. It is actually scary that she is a licensed nurse practicing on real people out there. I worry for her patients and coworkers. She has no clinical experience to pull from when she is teaching. She also cannot answer questions given to her. This is a class many of us had to teach ourselves.
4695,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,1.0,3.0,"There was a definite lack of preparation, minimal feedback to questions asked in class (sometimes even incorrect answers), and spoke to the class like we were in elem. school. She doesn't have a lot of experience but instead of just saying she isn't sure and will find out the answer she either says 'look it up and report back' or gives wrong info."
4696,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,1.0,4.0,"I passed her class just fine, but her lack of experience makes for a horrible experience. The constant telling us to google everything was annoying. I do agree you need to fact check what she says sometimes, but I think that is from lack of experience. Others said she was great in the clinical setting, but I cannot confirm this."
4697,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,4.0,4.0,"The other reviewers probably failed this class or the test. Her course is not easy, she makes you work for the grade. Can't complain when it comes to NCLEX time if we are prepared, right?"
4698,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,1.0,3.0,This is a difficult class and Iyer does not prepare you for anything. She tells students to constantly googling information because she cannot answer student's questions. She somehow has a bachelor's in marketing &amp; master's in nursing.... so she is very entry level nurse with no experience to pull from for lectures. Read and Fact check her ALWAYS!
4699,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NSRG102,1.0,3.0,"A difficult class, Iyer left us completely unprepared for exams and the level 200 class that continues. She uses someone elses PowerPoint, reads off the incomplete slides without filling in missing info. She has very little nursing knowledge to draw from. Tells us to google it when asked questions. Good luck if you get her."
4700,2201175,Ashley,Iyer,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG102,3.0,4.0,"She loves group work, skits, mini presentations, projects. Not great at filling in the details after skits are done. Does not seem to have a bank of experience to pull from when offering examples of situations that one might encounter as a nurse. Offers other peoples experiences which makes it hard to connect real world nursing with book knowledge."
4701,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,2.0,2.0,He doesn't have anything on the modules. He write everything on the board and if you don't come to class or talk to anyone in class you will get lost. If he knew how to use the modules to explain the assignments better would have been a lot better. I think he still is a good professor.
4702,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,3.5,4.0,"Be prepared to step outside of your comfort zone. Be prepared for constructive criticism because you will receive it. Be prepared to attend each class on time and stay! You receive points for signing in and out. They can help or hurt your grade tremendously. Overall, Professor Paul Hagan is a fair person. There are 5 speeches and 1 group assignment"
4703,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,2.5,4.0,"Mr Hagan is funny at times but he also has this dry and subtle aura that makes his class a tad bit boring. His grading, I must say, is quite harsh. In our class, most of us had to take the final which means most of us did not get a 90% to be exempt from that. Only 1 or 2 students were exempt because they participated in a speech competition."
4704,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,2.0,3.0,"He was unclear on his grading.(would mark off points and not give explaination) He took attendance points but if you were five minutes late upon arrival, you didn't get the 5 arrival points, and if you had to leave class early you wouldn't get the 5 departure points. Very sarcastic."
4705,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,5.0,2.0,"Mr Hagan is a great teacher and i recommend him, he is nice, you must go to class.. cause you get points for that! he is funny and the class overall is worth it."
4706,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,4.5,3.0,I thoroughly enjoyed this class. I also became a much better public speaking. He is very fair and open minded and wants you to enjoy the class. He loves to go off on tangents though and take up class time with personal stories. He also repeats himself a lot but overall he was a great professor.
4707,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM102,3.0,1.0,"Class was really simple. Show up, read the chapters, and you will do fine. Most of the quizzes were super easy. Tests and final are open book/open note. One presentation and two papers are the major portions of the class. Sometimes I think his paper grading is inconsistent for the class as a whole."
4708,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,5.0,1.0,I think Professor Hagan is wonderful! He has a good dry sense of humor and made class as enjoyable as possible. He is beyond fair. He gave students way more chances than they should have gotten to turn things in. He gives you all the information you need to succeed and is very clear on what is expected of you.
4709,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMMAABB,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hagan is a wonderful teacher. I listened, took notes, and tried hard to follow his pointers as a result I became a much better speaker. Take his class!"
4710,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,4.5,3.0,"Instructor is fair, offers feedback after speech and involves class during lectures. Expects serious commitment to course content and will let you know if you are sand bagging. Course requires 5 speeches of 3 to 6 min progressivly 3 of which are topics of your own choosing. First is to introduce a classmate, 2nd is impromptu. Would Recommend."
4711,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,5.0,3.0,Couldn't have asked for better speech professor.
4712,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM101,1.5,3.0,Not an easy prof. He does not grade according to and following guidelines that he he sets forth before projects begin.
4713,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMM102,4.0,5.0,"Paul Hagan is fair, fun, and interesting. His dry sense of humor escapes the younger students, but he offers information that is valuable in the real world. Communication is definitely a subject we all need to perfect and his emphasis is right on target."
4714,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,COMS101,4.5,3.0,"Prof. Hagan is a good teacher with a sense of humor, but if you take his class he will expect you to take it seriously. His voice is a little bit sleepy and monotone, but maybe that's because it was a night class."
4716,762379,Paul,Hagan,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Speech,SPEECH101,3.5,3.0,A pretty boring class but just come to class and you should do fine.
4718,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST101,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Sparks has being very kind and as long as you do your work, you will get the grade that you desire! Also, if you do not pass his class... Im questioning your character, not his."
4719,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST112,4.0,4.0,"Professor Sparks is extremely passionate about History. History was always a boring subject to me and he made it interesting to me. He makes it clear from day one that he is there as a resource to you for more than just the class and he means it. Be ready to read and take quizzes though. If you study and ask questions, you will be prepared."
4720,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST101,5.0,3.0,I took this class as an online class. We had very little homework but there was always something to do each week. He was a good teacher. If I had questions he was quick to email me back. The only thing that sucked was that there was a test every week but it wasn't easy to study because there was no homework. You will write one paper thought.
4721,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST111,5.0,2.0,"You will get what you put into this class. If you want to learn a LOT about World History, you can if you do all the reading. The online course is graded based on chapter quizzes, 4 exams, 1 research paper, and 2 weekly discusses. If you don't get an A in this class you didn't try, but for an online course you can still learn a lot."
4722,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST112,4.0,2.0,"He was very fair on grading. His Policy ""Just make sure you get everything turned in within a reasonable amount of time from the due date.""  He used the syllabus and due dates as guidelines for when we needed to turn everything in but they weren't set in stone.  This made the class so much less stressful!  He lets us connect history to real life."
4723,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST220,4.5,3.0,Excellent professor; he cares about the subject matter and provides an environment that makes learning interesting.
4724,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST111,5.0,3.0,"Everything a teacher should be! It's clear he has a passion for helping people succeed and connect with the material. He's SO willing to go out of his way to help everyone achieve their best- he even offers to loan out his personal books, movies, etc. Incredible instructor! Yes, you actually have to do some work, but it's never pointless busy work."
4725,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST112,5.0,1.0,"He is one of the best teachers I've had. He is very knowledgeable and loves the subject he teaches. He is willing to answer any questions, and if you do the work, you will get a good grade. I don't like history, but I appreciate it a lot more after taking his class. I would recommend him in a heartbeat!"
4726,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST111,4.5,2.0,"Great teacher - format is easy to follow-I learned more from this class than any others so far at Ivy Tech, he makes it interesting and you can tell he takes an interest in his students and their work. Great class."
4727,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST101,5.0,2.0,He is a really good teachers. If you work hard and show up to class you will do well. He is extremely helpful and is willing to help if you are having any trouble. Give him respect and he will respect you back.
4728,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST112,5.0,3.0,"Very good instructor, he is very attentive and responds to any questions or concerns that you have. I would definitely suggest him for anyone!"
4729,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIST101,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Spark's is awesome- he is one of the best teachers I've ever had. If you take his class seriously, do the work, and show up every day, there's not much chance of getting a bad grade. He's very smart, and brings history alive in his classroom. 10 out of 10"
4730,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,HIS235,4.5,3.0,"One of the best at the school, but expects alot from us."
4731,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,POLS101,5.0,3.0,"Extremely intelligent professor with the ability to enlighten and inform you on any issue pertaining to policy or history.  His course is demanding, but it will yield a significant intellectual gain if you commit the time and energy."
4732,1172355,Michael,Sparks,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Political Science,POL101,5.0,3.0,He is one of the best teachers at the school and really cares about us. Explains things well.
4735,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC224,4.0,4.0,Dr. Wylie is a good teacher. Sometimes she isn't clear on what she wants. Attendance is mandatory and late work is not accepted. Just do your work early.
4736,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC224,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Wylie has been one of the best professors I have ever had so far. She is someone who pushes you to do your best and expects nothing less. If you participate and show up to class, she will always be willing to work with you with late work or any other circumstance. She is so willing to help you with other things than the course."
4737,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC250,4.0,4.0,"Professor Wylie has a personality, which some people doesnt like and some do. However, she is a great educator, she is an example of hard work and encourages you to do your best. Not playing games tho, make sure you are ready to give your best."
4738,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC250,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic advisor, teacher, mentor. Shes a powerhouse; not sure how she gets it all done, which really inspires me. If she can do it, so can I. Love her class."
4739,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC224,5.0,4.0,My absolute fav teacher I've had at ivy. I've had her for 2 classes. She makes class entertaining with funny yet corny jokes. She only pushes you stay focused on the dream of becoming a teacher. She does so much for ivy tech and her students that she needs more recognition. She leaves valuable feedback on papers/assignments. Get ready to work tho
4740,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC121,5.0,4.0,Great Professor. She pushes you but is so supportive that it is worth while. I would recommend her to anyone.
4741,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC224,4.5,3.0,"Barb is GREAT. You will do fine in her classes if you show up and make an effort in all that she asks. If you don't make an effort then you won't do well. She doesn't give out A's, you earn them."
4742,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC250,5.0,3.0,Great Teacher!  Her passion shines through.  Goes out of her way to be helpful.  High expectations.  This was my favorite class!
4743,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC101,4.5,4.0,"Barb has a personality that many people are uncomfortable with: she is a strong woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind. That said, if you do the work and show that you're willing to make the effort, you will get along with her just fine and do well in her class. It has been my experience that those who wish to complain are the ones who don't try."
4744,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC101,4.5,4.0,Fabulous instructor.  Have enjoyed her very much this semester.  You will need to work in her class to get the A.
4745,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC101,4.5,3.0,"Barb is an AMAZING teacher! These people that say she is not helpful, really didn't try to get assistance from her. I am excited to transfer to IUPUI in the Spring, but also sad that I won't have Barb as a teacher for any additional classes. She allows her students to call, text, email, IM her and is always willing to assist her students!"
4746,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC250,4.5,4.0,Barbara is an amazing professor.  She does things like brings in clips of common movies to make her points.  She works with you to make sure you are prepared to go on to a four year institution.  She's one of the best instructors I've ever had.
4747,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC224,4.5,4.0,"Barb is a dedicated teacher who is willing to give the extra effort to make your student experience easier. However, you will have to put in the effort and time to earn a high grade. That being said, she is trying to prepare you for transferring to a university and a teaching career which are both demanding tasks. With Barb, you will be prepared."
4748,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC101,2.0,3.0,Works really hard and tries to be fun.  She's not organized at all. When you try and follow the syllabus she changes it on you.
4749,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,EDUC250,4.5,3.0,Ms. Wylie is challenging and fun.  I really enjoyed learning in her class.  I recommend her highly.  She goes out of her way to help you!
4750,1173202,Barbara,Wylie,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Advisor,IVY101,5.0,2.0,"Ms Wylie is a very energetic teacher.  I love to come to her class because she maks it real. Some kids say this was a blow off class, but I seem to think it was very useful.  Thanks to Ms Wylie to making it fun!"
4752,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,1.0,5.0,"Doesn't structure review classes- would rather stand in silence and let everyone go early than provide anything. Doesn't provide comprehensive study guides or an explanation for what is provided (answers only, no work) and then gets irritated if you try and have her work them all out during review class. Doesn't like repeating an explanation."
4753,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,1.0,4.0,"If you have a question, depending on her mood you may be made to look stupid in front of the entire class. Several students myself included were afraid to ask questions because of how she addressed the students when asking. A good portion of the material you will find on the exams is not covered in the review. Take this class with someone else."
4754,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,2.0,5.0,"Be willing to sacrifice a few goats to even get a decent grade in this class. No matter how hard you might to try to understand the material you will NOT be prepared for the exam. Homework ,extra time for tutoring, other professors, all of these and students still don't pass the exam. Take this class with someone else or somewhere else"
4755,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,2.0,5.0,"Be prepared to study your heart out of the reviews that are given. They are from 2012 and are nothing like the tests that you will get in class. The test will be over information / problems that you have never seen before. Hard grader and will doc you points for simple mistakes. Grades based on mood. Knows the info, but can't communicate it well."
4756,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH261,5.0,4.0,Professor was excellent.  Several examples were given during class with every type of problem you would come across on tests.  The material itself was quite difficult but professor made sure to prepare you for the tests as long as you were in class. Grading was pretty lenient on tests with lots of partial credit given
4757,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH261,2.0,4.0,"She knows whats going on, but I'm not sure if she quite knows how to explain it in a way that most people who dont put in hours reading the text will understand."
4758,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,3.0,5.0,"This class is one that you absolutely have to spend outside time on. Dalzell is incredibly smart but often doesn't explain the material well to students. She offers no curve or extra credit and despite having the highest grade in the AH Calc 1 class, I finished with an 89--my first B ever. Be prepared, do the homework (there's a lot), and STUDY!"
4759,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH261,5.0,4.0,Janet is one of my favorite profs at Ivy Tech. She takes the time to respond to questions during her lectures. She is very approachable if you need additional help with the content. I still drop by her office to say hi every once in a while.
4760,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,4.5,4.0,"Professor Dalzell is a GREAT math teacher, probably the best one I've ever had. She's always willing to work with you if you don't understand something and will explain concepts more in depth if you ask.  Her tests are a bit sadistic, you're going to need to study a lot to be able to get by in her class. You will definitely work for your grade."
4761,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH212,3.5,4.0,"My Calculus II professor. She is probably the best math teacher I have ever had (including high school). If you ask for help during class, she will take the time to explain it! There is a lot of homework and quizzes on WebAssign, and the tests are hard. "
4762,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH261,4.0,3.0,"can be sidetracked, but always great at answering questions"
4763,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH112,4.0,5.0,"When it comes to her tests she knows that have barely anything to do with the homework she assigns. She says she's willing to work with her students, but I found her not to be so flexible even when I kept in constant communication with her about the troubles I had throughout the semester. The only students who did really well had already taken it."
4764,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,2.5,4.0,She knows calculus way too well that she doesn't know how to explain it. She expects you to get it. Her tests are very hard. Some material on the test were not covered in class.
4765,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH211,2.5,3.0,"She is really confusing, I learnt from the HW more."
4766,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,OAHMATH,4.0,1.0,"Her test are really hard, but her explanation is the best I ever known."
4767,1544756,Janet,Dalzell,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH118,5.0,4.0,Janet Dalzell is a phenomenal professor.  It seemed as if she was one of the few PhD's at Ivy Tech Community College.  She was very explanatory and offered assistance whenever it was requested.  Taking calculus with her made me consider changing my major to mathematics.
4769,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NURG206,1.0,4.0,"I generally get A's because I'm willing to work hard for them. This is the worst instructor I have ever had and the exams are based on some fairy tale Peds book that doesn't exist outside of her mind. No feedback on assignments until the very end, after most things are submitted. Surprise--you're failing! Can't believe they keep her here."
4770,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,5.0,Awful!
4771,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,4.0,"As a class of 60 students, she was highly disliked (****HIGHLY****). We have determined that she is more concerned about her ego than providing a proper education. She read her notes for lecture word for word and provided conflicting info without clarifying the correct answer. Pop quizzes occur when attendance is low. Make sure you don't get sick."
4772,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,1.0,"Ivy Tech should be ashamed that this person still teaches here. I have urged prospective students to not attend this campus because of her. She is rude and unprofessional to students. Her lectures are nonsense but be careful, she retaliates against students for not attending by giving random extra credit when attendance is low."
4773,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,4.0,"Tells you not to base any of your child development knowledge on your own children, then spends the entire eight weeks comparing everything to her own experiences. She literally reads from the same notes you are given, word for word, with maybe two fill-in the blanks for each page. Test questions are written by children, I am almost positive."
4774,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NESG112,1.0,4.0,This instructor is disrespectful and unprofessional. She treats students like they are children and will yell at you for no reason in front of the entire class. She is on a power trip and she is not nice AT ALL. She acts as if she is better than you and will not let you forget it. I hope Ivy Tech actually sees these reviews.
4775,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG112,1.0,3.0,Mean and unreceptive. You have no idea what you missed on a test she doesn't go over it.
4776,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,3.0,"Lecture lacks any dynamics and is not engaging on any level. Tests are difficult to decipher. Be prepared to be spoken to as if you are a child, regardless of age or ability."
4777,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,5.0,"First off, I want to say that I am passing and will pass. This ""teacher"" is horrendous at her job and continues to let us know she's only 50% contract. Which is why it takes 7 days to grade a test, 7 days to respond to emails, 110+ pages of notes for each unit (every unit is only 1 weeK) and will not give you credit even if she is proven wrong."
4778,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,4.0,3.0,She is a wonderful instructor!

4780,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT. I REPEAT, DO NOT take nursing at the Ivy Tech Indianapolis Lawrence campus as long as this instructor continues to teach here. She is currently the only Peds instructor they have, so they will not get rid of her. Half of my class was failing halfway into the semester, including myself. As long as she is here, find another campus."
4781,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NRSG206,1.0,4.0,"This woman is on a power trip 24/7. She has to be right all the time, even if theres clear evidence shes wrong. If you fail a test, dont bother meeting with her afterward because youll leave with more questions than answers. Pro and con about her notes - theyre in depth and lengthy, but she follows the book directly, so you dont have to."
4782,2140504,Marie,Fiega,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Nursing,NURS206,1.0,5.0,"Treats students like children and makes exams way more difficult than they need to be.

4787,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH136,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Land was so caring and personable. I am not a math minded person at all, but he went out of his way to help me pass. He sets up study groups almost every week/weekend and is alway willing to help tutor. His classes were very long and heavy lecture  usually with a test or quiz at the end of almost every class."
4788,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH136,3.5,3.0,"Mr. Land is one of the best math teachers there is, but it's impossible to miss a class because he covers so much per session. If you've taken algebra before, you'll notice his steps are a lot longer and sometimes more difficult, but perhaps they're useful for people new to the subject. Regardless, he goes out of his way to make sure you do well. "
4789,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH136,2.5,5.0,"Very helpful as far as tutoring, yet still very confusing.  Not suited for an instructors should have stayed in the technical field of math.  A class of 30 should not dwindle to 7 for the final.  Retook class with another prof on line. Everything was much clearer and understandable, got a B.  Never had to go for extra help with the online class."
4790,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH136,3.0,4.0,"Mr. Land is a very nice person.  He goes the extra mile tutoring his students and helping them learn.  If you are already good at Algebra he is probably the perfect math professor for you.  However, if you struggle with Algebra, he can be a bit confusing in the classroom because of his vast knowledge of the subject."
4791,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH121,4.0,2.0,"Chris is a very likeable and personable instructor. He clearly has a strong passion for mathematics, and tries to show his students applications of math. Good instructor, he does his best to explain things to his students so they understand it. Very lenient and reasonable, I would recommend him."
4792,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH043,5.0,2.0,Chris is a GREAT instructor and he really prepared me for the College Algebra class to which I am currently enrolled. Mr. Land is a very good instructor.
4793,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH171,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor. He was available daily for assistance. I was terrible at math before taking his course and a year later I am still using things he taught me in my other math courses. TAKE ADVANTAGE of this amazing professor at Ivy Tech and enroll in his courses.
4794,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATHM111,4.0,3.0,best math teacher! take his class.
4795,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH0BH,5.0,3.0,He's by far the best math instructor.  Thorough and makes sure students understand the steps needed to solve problems.  I have a terrible background in math and he's made it much less overwhelming.  He gives lots of practice worksheets and practice for exams.  Very friendly and wants students to learn and enjoy math.
4796,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MAT111,1.0,4.0,He thinks he is being helpful but he tries so hard he is confusing. Switch teachers.

4798,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH111,5.0,4.0,"I am absolutely TERRIBLE at math.  So I started going to his study groups after class. He is an extremely dedicated, helpful, fun, nice guy. I absolutely adore him and his teaching style. He's kind, empathetic, goes out of his way to help, and is energetic about teacing. I've been to both IUPUI and IT and have never had such a great instructor."
4799,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MAT110AND111,5.0,1.0,"I'm not exaggerating when I say Chris Land is the best math teacher I've ever had.  He made things SOOO clear and SOOO easy.  I've always hated math and never felt like I could do it properly, but he made me like the stuff we were doing...  and not feel totally incompentant while doing it.  He was VERY helpful in getting us ready for exams.  Just a"
4800,657082,Chris,Land,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MAT111,5.0,3.0,very helpful guy. You would like his teaching style.
4801,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,2.0,2.0,Took her summer class and realized quickly if you challenge her she will put you on her do not like list. My personal ideas and beliefs contradicted hers and she graded me low for it. I wasn't the only one either. She spent a good bit of time ranting on personal ideas and thoughts while expecting everyone to agree.
4802,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,3.5,3.0,"My girlfriend attends IUPUI, and her Eng131(equivalent to our 111) was actually easier than Mrs. Skoks class. Yes, there is a lot of work, and yes you will need to research. But she works with you a lot. She offers plentiful EC at the end of the semester. I ended with an A. If you show up, do ur work, and are attentive, she will help you."
4803,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENGLISH1111HN,1.5,4.0,"There is an unbelievable amount of work due in her class. Online assignments, 5 page papers weekly, 2-4 journals due weekly, AND in class assignments. She is extremely biased in her opinions, which she voices ALL the time."
4804,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENGL111,3.0,4.0,"Disliked the tough grading, but came out very confident in my writing abilities."
4805,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,3.0,3.0,"She's a nice lady but she is definitely pushy with her opinions. ATTENTION: She does grade based on opinions and not the actual quality of your work, beware lol."
4806,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENGL111,4.5,3.0,I thought that Mrs. Skok was very helpful and attentive. She wants all her students to succeed and goes out of her way to make sure they do. I haven't been a student for over 20yrs. and she has really helped me. By far she is my favorite teacher this semester.
4807,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENGL111,1.5,4.0,Hated her class!!! She is very pushy and not very personable. Don't take her if you don't have too.
4808,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENGL111,4.0,5.0,"Not an easy class no matter how you slice it! Ms. Skok was a fine teacher to have and having been doing it so well, for so many years, she knows what is to be expected and how to assist the students in doing that. I feel much more prepared for the future."
4809,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,1.5,5.0,"Hated it!!  Teacher has a hard time explaining what she wants on research papers.  Every rewrite was something different. A few times journal and papers were misplaced ""lost"" but found later. Earned the hardest ""B"" of my student life.  Unnecessary rewrites consumed the majority of my first semester."
4810,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,1.0,5.0,Class was filled with more 45 minute rants than actual teaching
4811,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,3.0,3.0,"When I took her class, I found that she was somewhat tough, but overall, understanding. When it came to opinions, she certainly was that, though determining exactly what her opinions were was the challenge that I never quite mastered. Nevertheless, she graded fairly for those who did what they were supposed to do when they were supposed to do it."
4812,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,4.5,4.0,"I have ran across quite a few people who have had P. skok as a teacher, it seems that people either love her or hate her, i love her. got an A in her class..."
4813,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,2.0,4.0,"Yeah, I totally agree w/that first comment about the stories. She has her favorite students (older men who fetch her drinks before class,lol). And she doesn't like others talking in class or asking questions. Inflexable. Acts like we're stupid if we don't remember minor things from like 3rd grade!"
4814,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,2.0,4.0,"Very partial to things of religious nature. seems to have a story for every situation discussed in class (sometimes I think shes making half of it up) Over all, she isn't the kind of teacher I personally like. Shes too pushy with her opinions and viewpoints on things and skews them on whatever topic your interested in writing on."
4815,695841,Margaret,Skok,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,English,ENG111,5.0,1.0,"Very informative, kept the class interesting"
4817,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Conley was easily the best teacher I have had at Ivy Tech so far. I loved the course and he made it interesting and fun, and plan to take his 102 course. Would highly recommend him!"
4818,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST101,5.0,2.0,If you listen to what he says the class is easy.
4819,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST10120C,5.0,2.0,"So far I have taken two of Professor Conley's classes. Without a doubt, my favorite teacher of all time . One of the most passionate teachers I've had the pleasure of learning from. If I wasn't already a history major, I would switch immediately!"
4820,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,101,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Conley is one of the finest teachers I have ever had, A veteran who knows his U.S. History and is passionate about it. People like Mr. Conley push the human race forward with their lessons from the past."
4821,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HISTORY101,5.0,2.0,Favorite Professor of all time. Makes me want to be a historian too.
4822,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST102,4.0,1.0,"I enjoyed his class, but he never returned any of my emails at all.  Some of them I needed answers  on!  He said he'd show up on the last day so we could turn in our finals and he NEVER showed up!  That was very rude, in my opinion."
4823,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST101,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor.
4824,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST102,5.0,2.0,"the syllabus was simple... final, midterm, 2 quizzes, and 2 writing assignments...he gives you all the notes and terms..etc and if you study the terms and pay attention in class (videos ..etc) its a EASY A, most Q's are over terms,1 or 2 Q's on the tests are over videos ..no reading, except the assignments, which you can prepare at home.."
4825,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST101,5.0,3.0,Fabulous teacher. Absolutely the best instructor I've ever had at Ivy Tech. Actually cares about his students and knows what he's talking about. I took 102 because he was teaching it!
4826,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST101,5.0,1.0,My favorite teacher of all time. He loves history and is animated... class is never boring.He is still my favorite. Take his class. You will love History because of him. He IS THE BEST!!
4827,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST101,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Conley is my all time favorite college teacher. If you ever thought history was boring, take his class and you will think otherwise, he is on of the rare teachers that can make history very interesting and he actually cares about your success, he makes a lot of relevant jokes and is full of information. I wish he could teach more courses!!!"
4828,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST102,5.0,1.0,"Anyone who says that this guy isn't a 5 across the board, essentially must be an imbecile who cannot grasp his simple teaching method."
4829,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST105,5.0,4.0,"My favorite teacher of all time.  He loves history and is animated... class is never boring. I was in his class in Fall 2005, and he is still my favorite. Take his class. You can talk to him about anything. He rocks!!"
4830,1168569,Anthony L,Conley,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,History,HIST101,4.0,1.0,"Are you tired, run down, out of energy to take a history class? Fear not because Conley is the professor for you! He's sure to keep you on your toes with his energetic passion to history. No matter how the thought of history effects you, if you keep up with the reading (and preferably stay each class length), you'll have no complaints in his class."
4833,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,5.0,3.0,"Class was supposed to meet in person Summer '20. Due to covid, it got moved entirely online. I was fearful about taking a 4 credit, accelerated class online. He pre-recorded every lecture &amp; saved them via zoom on canvas. Then, during our scheduled ""class time"" he briefly reviewed &amp; allowed for questions. This man goes above &amp; beyond. TAKE HIS CLASS"
4834,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,4.0,4.0,"His lectures are very good, he knows his stuff, and he makes power points that really help you learn the concepts. He is very good about responding to emails - I've emailed him numerous times and he responds promptly, and gives very thorough explanations to my answers. It's not an easy class - concepts are hard to grasp so do your work &amp; study"
4835,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,1.0,5.0,"First off, hes very rude, arrogant and sarcastic. He wastes time by staring at the class waiting for you to take notes. He makes inappropriate comments and jokes. He teaches as if your applying to become a surgeon and hes a Chiropractor!! He gives the class two different color coded tests. One is easier than the other (verified). Dont take class"
4836,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,5.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Burgess this past spring 2019 semester for Advanced Human Physiology. Hands down he is one of the best professors I have ever had. He truly has perfected the art of teaching, and teaching human physiology. You don't need either book, never opened them once - he is literally just that good that you don't need to."
4837,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,5.0,4.0,"He has perfected the art of teaching advanced anatomy and physiology. You could not possibly find a better professor to teach this! No, he doesn't respond to his email and he TELLS YOU THIS on the first day of class, but he has review sessions EVERY WEEK so I think it is more than fair! Super nice. Never makes you feel dumb. Dad jokes."
4838,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,5.0,4.0,"Burgess is incredibly smart, and well prepared. He knows his material inside and out and is able to answer any questions you may have. The class is tough, it is a lot of material and you really need to attend his lectures. He also has review session every week that are a godsend. Go to review, and make sure you do all the practice outlines."
4839,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,4.0,4.0,"If you have a very solid understanding of APHY 101 and 102 and take time to study, you should do well in this class. Burgess presents lectures that make sense, help you understand with many diagrams, and adds helpful clinical tidbits to make the information connect to a real nursing job. Tests are very hard. He doesn't answer emails. Study hard!"
4840,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,2.0,5.0,Very hard class to get an A or B in. Too much information packed into one semester. Tests are confusing with trick questions. Burgess knows what he is talking about and often talks over your head instead of breaking things down. Lectures by PowerPoint and wastes a lot of time staring at the class waiting for people to copy information down.
4841,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,5.0,5.0,"Dr. Burgess really knows how to teach. His knowledge of anatomy is truly amazing. This is by far the hardest  anatomy class i've ever taken. We started out with a full class but by the end of it I think there was around 7 students left. There are 4 tests that are brutally hard. If your going into healthcare, you should definitely take this class."
4842,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,5.0,4.0,He is good. Very knowledgeable.
4843,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,1.0,4.0,"First of all, he is a chiropractor, not a prof. Second, he doesn't use the textbooks listed in the syllabus. He copies pages out of another lab book or hand writes his handouts with incomprehensible diagrams. Also, hope you don't need his help outside of class because he's impossible to get a hold of. I don't think he knows how to use a computer."
4844,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,5.0,5.0,"This is the best of the anatomy class, in fact this is 95% physiology. Outstanding professor. Go to every review session. Don't feel embarrass if you don't understand just ask. Extremely difficult class. The focus is in lecture 70%. Test question are tricky, no straight question with an straight answer. The review session is a must. Excellent class"
4845,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,ADVPHYSIO,5.0,1.0,Dr. Burgess is an excellent professor
4846,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,ANATOMY,4.0,4.0,1. Don't slack off 2. Appreciate the skeletal system (you'll understand halfway through the course why) 3.  Very knowledgable &amp; informative defiantly recommend course.
4847,1734211,David S.,Burgess,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Anatomy,APHY201,4.5,4.0,"This is a great class and I would highly recommend Dr. Burgess.  However, this is a very difficult class to get an A in.  It will require a lot of studying and I would also highly recommend going to as many open labs as possible.  There is also a wonderful outside tutor available.  Don't fear taking this class but be prepared to study hard."
4849,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,4.0,"Id never take another class with Ginette. Youre required to do 78 assignments weekly along with a Live-Chat assignment, a discussion board, and a quiz . The program you use is awful and requires you to do it perfectly. I enlisted the help of 3 fluent French speakers and we all still struggled. If you can avoid this professor, please do."
4850,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,3.0,"Took her Fren 102 course, little to no help was provided when asked for. This was during Covid, so late response is somewhat understandable but atleast a response would have been nice. A few projects, 3 in an 8 week course and ALOT of homework."
4851,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,4.0,"I took the online version of French 102, and was assigned to Ginette. She gives about 45+ assignments each week. If you send her a message for help on the assignments, she will respond the next day. As an online course, the teachers need to respond immediately! Ginette also does not help you, and doesn't clarify instructions on assignments."
4852,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,2.0,5.0,"There was a lot of homework online. The course was designed for you to just listen to her in class and take notes in order to pass the test. Workbook assignments needed to be presented in correct and edited format for her to give you full credit. She's willing to meet during her office hours, but given the difficulty of the class, it may be hard."
4853,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,5.0,"She's a native speaker, moves very fast, doesn't provide clarity on assignments, but expects you to go online and figure it out. Which is possible, but extremely inconsiderate. Not a very good teacher in general, her feed back is also arbitrary and doesn't help your grade. I went to her office hours twice, and studied all night and got an f still."
4854,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,HAXH788,1.0,4.0,"I want to warn all college Freshman students to not take her class, ever. First, she has nothing laid out specifically. None of the due dates were in the calendar like all the organized classes, and she last minute tells you what's due. In the beginning, she doesn't explain how to do assignments so you basically fail right from the start."
4855,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,5.0,I also had to file an appeal on this professor. I can't go into detail because my comment will be deleted. Do yourself a favor and don't take this class. Worst experience of my life. If I could rate her lower than a 1 I would.
4856,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,3.0,"I found that she provided very little clarity. This was difficult especially being an online class. I found that we were really on our own to figure everything out. Throughout the class we had multiple 100 point projects due, and she would never give any information on when those were due or if she had updated the content. Would not recommend!!!!"
4857,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,4.0,4.0,"She is lovely. Her personality is bright and bubbly. Thus far, she likes to include all of her students. So, to her, participation matters. However, she can be a bit confusing at times and sometimes a little clarity would help."
4858,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN201,1.0,3.0,"Does not answer questions unless you put HER desired heading in subject bar of emails, assigns up to fifty three online tasks a week, and does not seem to really care about the course. She does not teach, but leaves students to their own devices and a vague textbook."
4859,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN101,1.0,4.0,"Doesn't teach, reply to inquiries, or tend to her class. I attended her online class and most of the times the course site did not get updated well into the week... she also has this attitude that everyone seems to owe her something, or that she is superior to everyone else..."
4860,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN101,1.0,5.0,Very confusing and little clarity.
4861,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,5.0,I too had to file an appeal with ivy tech on this professor. I won't get into it for the sake of my comment being deleted. Do not take this class. Do not.
4862,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN102,1.0,5.0,This is easily my least favorite class I have ever taken.  She is a native speaker and the class moves very quickly and I found it hard to keep up and understand her. I actually ended up having to file an appeal with the school on her. It isn't worth the headache.
4863,1861455,Ginette,Ninon,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Foreign Languages,FREN101,3.0,3.0,"Such a sweet and lovely person, she is more than willing and happy to help after class and make sure you are caught up. Being from the Cote-D'Ivoire, she is a native French speaker and therefore very brisk in class. Be prepared to ask many questions and catch up after class."
4865,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,3.0,3.0,"Arrogant, yet knew what she was talking about, lectures addressed the material. 8 weeks for a science course with the same amount of material work expected is ridiculous, and an adjunct 1 day and you are screwed. 8 weeks is fine, just don't make it the majority of your class choices for those who don't live in ADD."
4866,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,4.0,"By far the best teacher I have ever had. You actually LEARN the information, I would recommend her to anyone taking SCIN100 or any class. She goes by the syllabus, and if you show up to class you should have no problem passing."
4867,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,2.0,"There are: 3 Current Event Essays (50pts each), 2 Lab Exams (70pts each), 1 Field Experience Project (40pts) &amp; 3 Lecture Exams (70pts each, all multiple choice). Read the textbook chapters thoroughly &amp; complete the optional study guides. You'll score higher on the Lecture Exams. Prof. Barrow made the material relatable &amp; interesting."
4868,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,3.0,Awesome instructor
4869,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,3.0,Erica is amazing. She is clear on everything you have to do in order to get an A. She is funny and makes all the information you learn relatable to something you do in your everyday life without being cheesy. If you need to take a science class I 100% recommend taking hers.
4870,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,5.0,This class is pretty basic and being an online class I expected to read. Professor Barrow responds quickly to questions and grades work within a week. The work load was pretty easy and if you do it there should be no reason to not get a good grade.  The class material is informative and good information to know about our world.
4871,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,3.0,This class is pretty easy if you read the assignments. Do the midterm/final study guide as you go.  It will help with quizes and midterm/final. If you do the work you will get a good grade.  There are hardly any discussion boards so it's all tests and a report. she is a great professor and there is no reason not to get an A.  Just show up and work.
4872,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,3.0,Erica is among my favorite instructors at Ivy Tech.  Her lectures are informative and engaging.  She is willing to spend extra time if someone doesn't get something.  The tests are not weighted heavily (I wish they had been) and there are 3 current event essays.  ALWAYS do the study guide!
4873,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,2.0,Erica is on of my all time favorite professors at Ivy Tech. She is a great instructor and I learned so much from her class (which sadly is hard to come by even in a college.) Highly recommend to anyone that wishes an educating experience at Ivy Tech.
4874,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,EARTHSCIENCE,5.0,3.0,"Science was the last thing I wanted to take and I could not have imagined loving this experience as much as I do. Erica makes the information interesting. Each day is like a cliffhanger for the next. There is a lot to learn and it is ""Science"", but it is very interesting mostly because of Erica's teaching style."
4875,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,101,5.0,1.0,Certainly the best professor I've had here at Ivy Tech.  Erica goes by the syllabus and there are no make up assignments.  If you go the class and study for the tests you will have no problem getting an A.  She also offers some extra credit that will help.  Her lectures are very clear and passionate with class participation.
4876,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,C05424492,5.0,3.0,Erica gives excellent lectures. She presents powerpoints slides and she will give you time to write notes from each slide before. Erica will then talk about the slides in thorough detail and will make it interesting. I learned a lot from Earth Science.
4877,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,4.0,"If you want an easy A,  don't take Erica's Earth Science class. If you want an academically satisfying class with a funny and witty professor that will TEACH you unlike any other professor,  she's THE best of the best.  She runs a tight ship. Go to class's on time,  participate, and take good notes.  She will make you interested! I simply love her!"
4878,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,1.0,"Easiest class I've ever been in, prof. Is funny and makes topics interesting, and is very approachable. I recommend taking this course with this instructor."
4879,1863641,Erica,Barrow,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Earth Science,SCIN100,5.0,2.0,"Lecture consists of a powerpoint presentation. Erica will allow time/walk around the room to insure you are taking notes (which is a good idea). Online 10pt untimed quiz every week. Major focus should be placed on the three 70pt in-class scantron exams, 3 current event essays, and 2 lab exams."
4880,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT122,1.0,5.0,"Graded on criteria having nothing to do with the course.  Online accounting software class, project done, but not in a format she preferred and although there was no mention of using the particular software she preferred in the syllabus, she deducted over half of the points.  Worst prof in the department."
4881,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,A100,5.0,3.0,Awesome
4882,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT101,4.5,3.0,"ACCT 101 isn't an easy class to begin with, but she allows a ridiculous amount of extra credit, so much so that if you do ALL the homework you should be able to pass this class even if you fail the tests. Which for a math type professor absolutely awesome."
4883,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,BUSA310,3.0,5.0,This is the only accounting class I've ever taken without a curve. The entire class was non-accounting majors &amp; performed horribly and LeSure didn't know how to help us. I was one of only 7 students to get higher than a C.
4884,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT101,1.0,5.0,"Really bad! She is one of the worst teachers ever! I would show up every class, and I only got half my questions answered if that. I literally asked her a question and she walked away from me, and I know she heard me because she was standing in front of me and looking right at me. If there is anyway you can avoid this teacher,Do! "
4885,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT101,5.0,1.0,Great instructor who will stay after class with you as long as you need to understand a problem
4886,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT101,1.5,5.0,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! Doesn't respond quickly at all. Doesn't want to help you at all. Very blah in emails. Honestly, she was very discouraging period! Don't take a course from her. I wish I would have read these before I signed up with her."
4887,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,BUSA310,1.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE Professor. First words on Day One: ""We'll see how this goes"". Does not give any assistance whatsover. Seriously, when I asked for help, she referred me to the text which is  just as bad as her teaching skills. This class is a intro to cost accounting for Finance Majors and she acts like we have the CPA. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
4888,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT101,4.0,4.0,Do not take any accounting class online. I took ACCT 101 3 times before taking it with Jennifer. She was helpful. Have to study the material.
4889,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT102,5.0,4.0,Easy to understand and an effective teacher.
4890,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCT101,2.5,2.0,Online course.  Slow and poor response to online communications.
4891,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACT101,1.5,4.0,Don't take online!!!
4892,829378,Jennifer,Lesure,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Accounting,ACCTA1H,3.0,3.0,All considered she is OK
4895,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVYT111,5.0,1.0,He is very nice and funny. Learnt a lot from him.
4896,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVYT111,5.0,4.0,Yes he does talk about himself but its all funny. He just wants you to better yourself and learn new things. I would take this class over and over again
4897,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVYT111,1.0,1.0,"If you have Prof. Clark drop his class and ask for another instructor. He is arrogant, full of himself, and a egomaniac. All he does is talk about himself, his daughters, or his tricep exercises. Hands down the worst professor I've had the displeasure of having."
4898,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVT120,5.0,3.0,listening and participating in class is key!
4899,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVY120,1.0,3.0,"I honestly hated this class. He talks in definitives the whole class and says things will ALWAYS happen the way he says. He honestly believes he knows all and doesn't listen to anyone else's opinions. He grades work based on personal opinions he has on the content and student, even when it contradicts the rubric. Does not promote creative thinking."
4900,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVT120,5.0,1.0,Great teacher really enjoyed his class!
4901,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,B6HSUCCESS,4.5,2.0,"I'm sitting in his class now, hes a great professor. i would take this class again. its for eye opening and easy. if you fail than you didn't take notes."
4902,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVY120,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher, Makes you DIVE DEEP Helped me learn how to go to college. If you are returning to school after a long time take Ivy 120 and take it with  Professor Carl Clark. Thanks Professor  Clark for your encouragement. "
4903,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVY120,4.5,1.0,"Professor Clark is the greatest.  He is there for you.  FUNNY as hello. If you need to take Ivy 120, He's the Professor to do it with. He's fare  LOVE  THIS PROFESSOR."
4904,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,IVT120,1.0,3.0,"If you get this teacher, drop this class. He is very full of, he does not help students. He does not elaborate on what he expects but for sure grades you unfairly. He had us write a paper and never explained in what format he wanted but took ten points off my paper for the wrong format but he NEVER told us what format. He does not fix his mistakes."
4905,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH015,5.0,2.0,"Great Teacher, he really cares about the students learning the material. Thanks Mr. Clark you made me like math."
4906,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH015,5.0,1.0,"He's the best math professor i've had!..extremely outgoing, always smiling and willing to throw you a bone! He is funny and always helpful during lecturing! His lectures are mixed with examples of love and life! (if you get him, youll know what im talking about) esp when you get to fractions and division. exmple, ""shes an 8, hes a 0!"""
4907,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MATH015,5.0,1.0,"Mr Clark is wonderful! He is extremely helpful and very friendly esp for being a 730am class he is energetic and ready to start! You will not regret being in his class. He cares about his students and he will have you laughing!! Its important to be in his class during lecture! Very outgoing, Kind, and close to his students!! I recommend him:)"
4908,1190718,Carl B.,Clark,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Mathematics,MAT040,1.0,5.0,if you get him change your teacher as soon as possilble !!!!!!
4910,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYC101,5.0,3.0,Ms. Bennett is a great instructor.  I feel like she really wants to see her students succeed.  She is accessible outside of class for questions and was more than willing to help with the course paper.  I highly recommend her for psych 101.
4911,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,3.0,"Toby was an awesome professor, and was always going out of her way to make sure she could help in any way possible. During an assigned research paper project, I became stuck and she let me call her &amp; helped tremendously. She is always quick to respond to e-mails and is very thorough during her lectures and covers everything. I would take her again!"
4912,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYC101,4.5,3.0,"Bennett is a fantastic instructor who knows her stuff.  She is extremely helpful and will go well beyond what most would in order to help.  She's not for everyone, her lectures are long, but you get a lot of breaks.  I really enjoyed her class."
4913,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,3.0,She's great! I passed the class with a 96%!
4914,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYC101,5.0,1.0,"Toby is THE BEST teacher I've taken EVER! She is solo helpful and very lenient. It's very important to go to class, but she is very helpful and I could have sworn I got a D but ended up with a B. It was such a pleasure to take her class. Online quizzes and test. (which is rare). I WOULD DEF. TAKER HER AGAIN AND RECOMMEND! THANK YOU TOBY!"
4915,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYC201,5.0,3.0,"Loved this teacher! She is extremely intelligent and insightful due to her background in school. She was awesome at making things clear and went above &amp; beyond to make sure the class understood the material. Her tests are not easy by any means, but if you pay attention and study, you'll do fine. Wish I could take other psych classes through her!"
4916,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,2.0,"Loved Ms. Bennett! She was always very helpful and was willing to answer any questions you might have even if it was a personal nature or even about other classes. She was a biologist and is extremely insightful in other fields of study as well. Like mentioned before. PAY ATTENTION. You're at school for a reason,and you're in college. act like it!"
4917,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYCH101,1.0,4.0,"She was an awful teacher...she got so sidetracked and talked about other things, making it hard to focus on the actual subject.."
4918,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYCH101,3.5,5.0,"One piece of advice...Keep up with the material.  Professor Bennett really wants you to understand the material when it comes to the tests and quizzes.  You have to write a 5 page paper, which I stressed out about for nothing.  She graded so fare."
4919,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYCH101,5.0,5.0,"Great for biology students and also great in educational psychology.  She really helped me improve my critical thinking and analytical skills.  Her class is helping me way beyond the field of psychology.  It is not easy, but is worth the work."
4920,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYC101,4.0,3.0,"She has low tolerance for those who don't pay attention, but for those of us who really want to learn, she's great.  Very knowledgable, and for anyone applying to nursing, she is a former anatomy teacher, so she is great to prep you for other classes.  She is tough, and you do need to apply yourself (it's not a blow off class)."
4921,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYCH101,4.0,3.0,"Very funny and witty. Easy to get a long with and talk to. One piece of advice, turn your phone off!"
4923,1193682,Toby,Bennett,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Psychology,PSYC101,4.5,1.0,"Funny, down to earth and knowledgeable. She made a mandatory class very interesting."
4924,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,2.5,1.0,"I took this class online becuase I gave birth that semester. I dont have anything good to say about him other than the fact that he's easy going. Everytime I emailed him, he neglected to get back to me, Even when i went into labor and requested another week on my assignments. I would have been ok with NO but he didnt even respond.NOT PROFESSIONAL!"
4925,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOCI111,3.5,1.0,"This instructor does not cover a lot of syllabus in the class. He does not respond to emails and he is not usually present in his office at the campus..meaning..if you are not present in his class regularly, you may lose points or miss exams. Otherwise, his exams are take home &amp; easy and grading is liberal. An easy A. As a person, he's great."
4926,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,5.0,1.0,"His voice boomed. He shocked people. He was controversial. He forced us to think. He challenged our assumptions and got our attention.
 He dominated the classroom.  He is a master conductor with a powerfull mind. He rarely needed to look at a piece of paper yet every second of his class was packed full of meaning and instruction.
 
 I love him."
4927,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,2.5,1.0,"Great man, brilliant, but a horrible teacher. Yes, he does lead some interesting discussions, but he doesn't teach the material. Tests are always take home and ""library days"" are pretty frequent. Steer clear of him if you actually want to learn anything."
4928,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,5.0,2.0,Professor Townsend makes every effort to ensure that we are getting what we need. He is an awesome storyteller and very inspiring.
4929,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOCI111,2.5,3.0,"Did not like to be questioned, very sensitive."
4930,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,4.5,2.0,This class is a great introduction to Sociology.  The text by Schaefer combined with Mr. Townsend's thought-provoking discussion boards make this course a gem!
4931,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,4.5,3.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It was easy, but not because of the lack or easiness of work. It was made interesting, which made me WANT to know more, making it seem like a breeze. Great conversations, very laid-back atmosphere. I wish he taught more classes I need!"
4932,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOCI111,5.0,1.0,Great teacher! Absolute pleasure to learn from. Lots of conversation and laid back.
4933,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,4.5,1.0,"Interesting to listen to.  Open conversations in class kept you interested.  Open book tests, easy A."
4934,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOCI111,3.0,1.0,Cool class  helps one use critical thinking
4935,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOCI111,2.0,1.0,good class if you want an A but you dont learn anything
4936,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOCI111,5.0,4.0,He is off the hook!! I really enjoyed his class.
4937,1267233,David,Townsend,Ivy Tech Community College: Indianapolis,Sociology,SOC111,4.5,1.0,"Ultraliberal, easy going, EASY A"
4939,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,1.0,5.0,"I took his class in summer (6 weeks) fully online due to COVID. I basically ended up teaching the material to myself with only the textbook to rely on as well as videos that I found online. Even though he didn't even took the time or effort to teach the class (so, do his job) his tests were brutal over very specific details and lots of hw! Awful!!!"
4940,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1407,5.0,2.0,"He was an amazing professor. The class is not difficult for a hybrid class. I had some personal matters going on but as long as you provide yourself, you will earn your grade. You'd want to take him and his super funny."
4941,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,3.0,"He is very specific and precise on what he will be including on exams, no surprises on his exams. He is extremely knowledgeable about microbiology and he makes the class interesting by sharing his own experiences on the subject. His energy and excitement for the material, makes you excited about learning it."
4942,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,2.0,I wish I would have known to taken Tim for ALL of my science classes. He makes class entertaining with his rants and stories! There are quizzes almosteveryday but he preps you for them its just up to you to study. The tests are literally questions fr the study guide. Study guide is very long but if you study it should be great on test. TAKE HIM!
4943,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,1.0,"Professor Cifelli is AMAZING! His lectures are very interesting and funny. I wish he could teach all the Sciences courses. He is the BEST Biology, A&amp;P and Microbiology teacher I have ever had. He is very clear on what will be on the test. Its a hard course so study, and you will pass."
4944,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1407,5.0,2.0,"He is great at what he does (and funny too). The class isn't hard, as long as you do the work. The amount of work is your average college level amount, but it's easy. Tests are straightforward as well. Don't skip anything and you will get an A."
4945,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2404,5.0,4.0,Professor Tim is an amazing instructor. He tells his students stories that help you remember the topic that is being discussed in class.
4946,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,4.0,4.0,"Professor Cifelli is incredibly hilarious and super knowledgeable when it comes to the material. He assigns a lot of homework, but the homework is essentially your study guide for the exam, so there's no question about what you need to know. You will have major grade every class that can not be made up. I would advise you NOT to skip class."
4947,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,Fun guy and a great professor! I wish more professors/teachers cared like him. Amazing individual.
4948,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,4.0,Tim's great he is always willing to help you make the grade you need. The class is hard so be ready to put the time in but well worth it with him.
4949,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,3.0,Awesome Professor! Highly recommend taking him.
4950,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO1406,5.0,2.0,Awesome professor! enjoyed taking this class with him.
4951,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,3.0,"Tim is a great professor! He is very clear on grading, gives extra credit and the tests come straight from the homework. He molds the class to fit real-world scenarios you will find in your health career. He is easy to approach with questions. TAKE HIM! I will have taken him for 3 of my 4 general sciences!"
4952,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,4.0,"I believe that he is a great teacher. He explains lectures very well and will take the time to answer questions. Though the homework is extremely long, the exams make up for it because it takes questions word-for-word from the homework. Overall, this teacher is very worth taking."
4953,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,4.0,If you really are interested in learning the subject matter then this is THE CLASS to take. He takes very complicated material and finds a way to make it relatable and understandable. He make the extra effort to ensure everyone understands the concept. Theres a lot of homework but basically your test study guide. BEST TEACHER ANYWHERE. No lie.
4954,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOLOGY1408,5.0,4.0,Love him as a professor! Would definitely recommend him!
4955,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,3.0,Tim was fantastic. He has a thorough understanding of the material presented and gives really good examples. He grades very fairly and he is very transparent about what is on the quizzes and tests.
4956,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,2.0,"Professor Cifelli is one of the coolest professors I've ever met. I took his hybrid class. He really loves what he does. Beware, BE ON TIME to class! One minute late and you're out the door for 15 minutes while others finish a quiz. Lots of homework, test come straight from the homework. Takes a while to respond but overall great."
4957,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,2.0,Good professor.  Homework questions are the test. A&amp;P 1 in general is not a class to skip out on. Professor keep the class fun and interesting.  Does go through some material quickly which was a little frustrating at times.
4958,1743629,Tim,Cifelli,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,4.0,I took the hybrid course for biol 1406. Do the homework and you will pass the exams. Go to class and do the labs. Its an easy class and easy grade.
4960,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"I was incredibly nervous about taking an anatomy class online (and as a minimester!), but Dr. Desai was so helpful and gracious along the way. She is very organized in her lectures and clearly lays out what's expected of you. If you listen to the lectures and do the assignments, she's set you up for success. Would LOVE to take her other courses."
4961,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,4.0,4.0,Took Dr. Desai's 5wk summer A&amp;P1 online due to COVID. She gives everything you need to prepare for labcture exams. I made mostly As on the lab exams but did poor on the lectures. Very challenging course but if you're going for nursing she will prepare you for the Hesi and/or Teas exam. She uses PPTs &amp; lecture videos. Gives extra credit too!
4962,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,"Took her 5 week summer class online during Covid. Best decision ever, very caring and responds to emails quickly. A&amp;P is hard no matter how you take it or who with. There is homework, extra credit, tests and quizzes but they are reasonable. Gives lots of study material and recorded lectures. She is very helpful. 100% recommend."
4963,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,5.0,"I took Dr. Desai for AP1 based on my colleagues recommendation and he was not wrong. This was a hard class, especially the last two exams. But she gave us all the resources to prepare. She is very clear and detailed in her lectures and I highly recommend watching them. I know I am well prepared for AP2 and Nursing. Dont slack off!"
4964,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,2.0,5.0,Took her for a 6 week mini mester. Was a very hard course. The test are nothing like the practice test. When I asked her for additional resources she told me to use those and they don't help. She has like seven answer choices for one question. She's not very helpful. I self taught myself everything. Basically I paid for her to not teach.
4965,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,Took this as 6 wk summer class. Material was not hard since I had taken Intro A&amp;P. But you need to put in a lot of time. She has recorded lectures that was a plus. Lots of easy work mixed with some hard exams as expected. Be sure that you do not fall behind. She's helpful is you email her questions. Gives prompt replies unlike my previous prof.
4966,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,2.0,4.0,"I don't know why she got high marks, its the only reason I took her. Her test a extremely hard, there are no guides or reviews, none of her test are like material in HW, PRACTICE TEST OR lab test. I have no idea where shes pulling her material from. The load of work is extreme. I worked everyday 5-6 days a week, even did extra credit work."
4967,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,3.0,3.0,"This class was hard, but A&amp;P isn't easy. I took her for nutrition and thought she was amazing. I felt she helped me less during this class, which really sucked. Sometimes her slides were useful and sometimes not so much. Read if you can, and don't slack. Gives extra credit, but not much help. She would be a good solid 2nd choice."
4968,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,1.0,All you need to do is read. The quizzes are easy because you can take them up to three times and the highest grade is taken. The exams are just like the quizzes so make sure you study them before you take the exams. Make sure to stay on top of the ONE project you have. It was very easy.
4969,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,1.0,"I took Dr. Desai online and she is the best! Tests are literally just like the homework. Gives a study guide already filled out. Homework due every Saturday and you have 3 tries to do it and make the grade you want. Big project thats easy, just stay on top of it. Knows we have other classes so doesn't pile us with too much. The best!"
4970,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Desai is a wonderful professor! While her lectures are long, she presents the material in a way that is easy to comprehend. Do not take her 100% online class if you lack time management skills. This class requires a lot of work and dedication, at least 25-30 hours of studying/week."
4971,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,4.0,"One of the most difficult courses I have taken, but Dr. Desai is such a great professor in that she has the talent to take difficult information and explain it to you in a way that you are able to comprehend. Lots of extra credit, HW, and lecture, but is necessary. Caution for FT working student-this course requires about 30 hrs/week. Dedication!"
4972,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,"Prof Desai was the best ever! She gives out so much extra credit, it'll bring you up a letter grade. She is able to answer all questions and will help you if you need it. Usually I forget things after I take the test, but with her lectures I am able to remember everything. The sweetest person ever. I wish I could take her for bio 2402."
4973,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Desai is an amazing professor. She knows the material very well. There is no wasted time in class. She is very straight to the point. I took the hybrid class (lectures were online, lab was in person). You have to work hard in this class. Tests are detailed, but she gives very many extra credit opportunities to help. I would take again."
4974,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Desai is a solid choice for A&amp;P. Her video lectures &amp; resources are AWESOME. 2 lowest quizzes get dropped, HW can help you a whole letter grade. She is very responsive to emails. My only warning is to the working student considering her hybrid summer class. Test &amp; deadlines are inconsistent &amp; only open for set days. It's a lot if you work FT."
4975,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,3.0,Such a great professor! She really cares about whether or not you learn. She is always available to answer questions and as long as you read the material she provides and go through the lectures you will do great. You also do a really fun project at the end which taught me a lot.
4976,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,4.0,3.0,"I took a 3 week mini mester for nutrition. It was fast paced, but do-able. The course recommends to spend time learning a chapter or two every day so that you don't fall behind. There's homework that can be done easily and a test every week. There was also a project that you work on which is really interesting. Professor Desai gives good feedback"
4977,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,2.0,"3 week mini- each week read 3-4 chapters, watch short videos, 1 easy homework assignment and Exam. A 3 day diet Analysis report is due just keeping track of your food intake. Real easy. She provides lecture notes and power points and review. She references book pages to go to so the book is useful but otherwise almost all material is in her notes."
4978,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,4.0,"She wants for her students to push themselves over what is expected from them, that's why she's considered as a tough grader. What I recommend to do is working on the exam reviews answering them with the 3 sources (PPT, book and her notes) in your words, this way you'll do well on tests. Work on the assignments and the project and you'll do great!"
4979,408361,Smruti,Desai,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,3.0,"I took BIOL 2402 online &amp; made an A+. Desai is an easy grader, quick in responding, &amp; grades everything in a timely manner. She provided us with recorded lectures which were really helpful in understanding the material. Tests come from the powerpoints. Labs are performed at home (not difficult). A lot of assignments but majority are extra credit."
4981,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"Professor Taggett seemed like a good professor at first , and she told us that if we did our work and applied are selves that we would be fine. But once we got homework and papers the class got really hard. She would tell me that my paper was really good in class and then I would end up failing the paper. Also you will never know what your grade is"
4982,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,"I would take another one of her classes in the future if possible. She will not just hand out grades, you will need to work for it. However, she gives you excellent critiques so there is no doubt as to what she is looking for. Also utilize Jane, as she is a tremendous help!"
4983,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,First when I went in this class I thought she pretty cool but later into the semester she gets very hard especially will all the papers you have to do. If I was you don't take this class or you will fail.
4984,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1301,1.0,5.0,"If you take this class, get ready to work. All I can say is that my best was not good enough for her. I put in so much effort and barely passed. TOUGHEST GRADER EVER!! feedback of what she wants is unclear. This class literally destroyed my mental health. I would never recommend her! She expects you to be in the writing level of Shakespeare!"
4985,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,She is very specific about how she would like things done. If you turn in a paper that is not to her standards she will make you resubmit until it reaches her standards. She also makes you write about one topic the entire semester over and over again. Also if she doesn't like you she will treat you differently (based on attendance and classwork)
4986,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1301,4.0,4.0,"I took Honors English, and English is neither my major nor my native language. My grammar was too horrible that someone had to say it into my face. However, professor Taggett has helped me so much in strengthening my grammar and writing skill. She has high expectations, but those are for a good outcome. If you really want the knowledge, take her!"
4987,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"By far the hardest English Professor I have dealt with. I went to her office hours for additional help; however, she wasnt clear as to what she wanted. Shes not clear on her grading criteria. Also, every time I resubmit my paper and fixed the corrections she wanted, she always find other problems in my writing. One of the hardest and worst class."
4988,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGLH1301,4.0,4.0,"Honestly, professor Taggett is a good professor. English is not my first language, so it has always been a tough course for me. However, she was very willing to help me getting better in English and understanding her feedbacks. Utilize her office hours! She obviously cannot read students' mind, so communication is the key. You must put in efforts!"
4989,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,2.0,4.0,"With respect to the positive raters, my father is an educator and believes that when the majority of your students are struggling, you need to rethink your approach. Ms. Taggett is ineffective and her purpose is not clear. Feedback is constant but is always a moving target, and if you don't hit the target, too bad. It's all or nothing. Unfair!"
4990,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"Horrible. Our class is completion based, however if she doesnt think your work is good enough she makes you submit it again. I had to submit a paper SEVEN times before. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!"
4991,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"I took this class as a summer course. It is already short to begin with. Then she went on vacation so it got cut even shorter. The last weekend of class we had 3 assignment to do which were very time consuming. This class is a completion based course, however she sends back assignments if she doesn't think they are good enough. Worst prof. by FAR"
4992,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,1.0,5.0,Mrs. Taggett respectfully is one of the worse professors Ive ever had. Ive had a couple bad ones but she takes the cake. Very petty when grading your paper and gives you way too much work especially at the end of of the Semester where the 3 papers are due for what? To make you fail? DO NOT take this class. I warn you now
4993,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Taggett was one of my favorite professors. Don't get on her bad side, but I loved her classes. Anyone who says her class is too hard is looking for an easy A. She gave good feedback on my papers and was committed to helping me improve my writing. Took her for Honors English."
4994,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,4.0,3.0,"Professor Taggett is Great, reading these ratings made me upset for her. She is so passionate and helpful and anyone who struggled just didn't show up or put effort. Take her class, she cares so much for her students!"
4995,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Tagget is amazing. If you don't pass this class then that means you didn't follow instructions or show up to class. Her feedback is amazing, she is very specific on errors that need to be corrected on your essays. She is passionate and friendly, she genuinely wants everyone to pass her class. Time management and commitment are key."
4996,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"Tough grade, disrespectful to students, talks to you like youre a dog, gives you disgusted looks on the daily, judges you more than helps."
4997,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,4.0,Don't take this class!!!
4998,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"Unless you are a English major, I recommend that you dont take this class! BEWARE"
4999,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,She is a tough Professor. Always gives you bad feedback. Do not take her if you want to Pass.
5000,516775,Laura,Taggett,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGLISH1301,2.0,5.0,I had her for honors English she was good at first. I didn't know she was bad until I saw the reviews &amp; she does grade hard. I did my very best but I know I won't take her again for English 1302. Some days she seem so stress that she doesn't want to be friendly.
5002,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,5.0,4.0,Easy class as long as you keep up with your assignments. Exams are not hard as long as you do the review he offers.
5003,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,5.0,3.0,Great teacher!
5004,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,5.0,4.0,"If you do the work you will pass, Provides the necessary materials and lectures to get you there."
5005,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,5.0,"This is by far the hardest class I have taken. This class requires a lot of work. The tests were very hard, and homework is very time consuming. I liked how he did Webex review sessions and was available for questions. He is a great professor, I just feel this course needs to be taken in person. You will have to teach yourself/YouTube."
5006,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,4.0,4.0,"Overall, it was a tough class, but I definitely will say I learned a lot. The exams are definitely the hardest thing about this course, but Dr. Allen is extremely understand of your life outside of school, and I am extremely grateful for that. Do Your Work! and Study!!! He's also really accessible outside class times too, sign up for the remind!!!!"
5007,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Allen was very helpful with the online learning. As long as your weekly assignments get completed and you study the material, you will be just fine. He is very understanding with life outside if school, and if you come to him about a late assignment with honesty, he will be there for you to help you with that."
5008,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Allen made learning Microbiology online less stressful than I thought it would be. This class has heavy reading (1-2 chapters a week), but the Connect assignments truly help in learning and understanding the content. Warning, the Connect assignments do take quite some time to complete. Deadlines on Fridays. The exams are lengthy but fair."
5009,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,5.0,3.0,He's a great professor
5010,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,4.0,4.0,"Although this class can be very challenging, it's nothing any student shouldn't be able to handle. The workload can be large at times but with proper time management, students will be fine. This course also forces you to learn the material and thoroughly understand everything which can be helpful for the second half of BIOL."
5011,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,3.0,4.0,"I think this professor would be great for in person, but not online. This course required a lot of reading. He did have a lecture posted in his course from another professor it was a little, but it didn't always match with what you need to know for the exam. I did appreciate the txt reminders and how he was always available to answer questions."
5012,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,4.0,This class is very challenging but professor Allen makes it possible to understand the material. Attendance is not mandatory but he always makes time to review with students over webex!! If you miss any assignments he will work with you and make sure you get your education. You will not regret taking him!
5013,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher! He holds study sessions via webcam for anyone who needs it, the grading criteria is VERY straight forward. As long as you follow along on ""connect"" then you will be fine. He is also very understanding and curves the tests if need be."
5014,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,4.0,"Professor Allen is a great professor and he's always there to answer any questions you may have. I've never had a professor be so readily available at any time to help, so that's something I really appreciated. This class requires a lot of work, so be ready to spend a lot of time on assignments. As long as you do the work, you will pass."
5015,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,3.0,4.0,"It wasn't to bad the majority of the grade goes toward the exams, but he drops the worst exam grade."
5016,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,3.0,4.0,"A lot of material that he expects you to memorize and apply. Lots of reading, both in sheer volume and amount that needs to be retained. The lectures used were from another professor on YouTube so a lot of the exams didn't necessarily match lecture material. He was very accessible for questions but it definitely felt as if I was teaching myself."
5017,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Allen is a really good! He great at communicating! This was probably one of the most difficult classes I have taken, mainly because of the work load. Everything is doable though, just very time consuming and he lets you know that right off the bat. Procrastination  failure, and he is not kidding."
5018,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,5.0,This course is no joke on how much material there is too learn. The professor however always made himself available for assistance. Hard Course but Amazing Professor!
5019,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,4.0,5.0,"I know that I am not very good at science. Beginning was easy at first a little, but as weeks go on it does get harder. Studying for the tests is very important or you will not do good at all. He is very good at answering the questions I have in a decent time span."
5020,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,4.0,"Awesome class, but definitely hard especially if you don't do the work. If you have a job and family just be prepared to do lots of homework on Connect, as that's how to obtain participation in his course."
5021,2156924,Christopher,Allen,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,2.0,"He is an interesting professor that I have ever taken for Biology class. He is funny during our class on Webex before each exam. He will make time to review and go through all the things for you and answer your questions. If you take his online class, be ready to do a lot of weekly assignments, but they are useful and informative. Good luck to you!"
5023,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,2.0,"Good man, good teacher, just take him. You won't regret it or you will but you will learn :D"
5024,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,3.0,4.0,Moves too fast on lessons.
5025,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,3.0,"I had to drop the class due to work and the f-COVID, but I have to share my respect for Mr. Primo. He tried to cheer me and keep me on. It is just too much right now. I am taking him again in spring for two classes. Good careing man take him. Not may teachers care."
5026,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1301,1.0,5.0,I took Professor Primo he wasn't good as everyone said he will be! I recommend 100% that you don't take him. don't go through I went through! Spring 2020 was my first semester taking media courses I thought I enjoyed this course but it turned out one worse courses I've taken thanks Professor Primo!
5027,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,2.0,He's a good professor and lays very clear expectations for each assignment. The material itself is a bit verbose but he wants to make sure everyone understands it. I really get the feeling he cares about the success of the students and is quick to offer guidance and answer questions.
5028,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,3.0,"Taking this course during Summer was a real challenge but the course is very organized and the feedback of the professor is very detail. If I can, I will take professor primo for as many classes as possible until I graduate."
5029,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,2.0,I thought the course would be a real challenge but Professor Primo has definitely made it a lot easier. The videos with his reviews are very thorough. Also the feedback videos are the most helpful and that definitely helps with makeing the corrections needed to do better on the next assignment.
5030,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,4.0,"This is my second time taking this class. I did horrible the first time and I have no interest on coding (like zero) but this time around I learned and now I understand how HTML and CSS work. I am taking Interactive Media with Mr. Primo in the fall, and I hope the course is as good as this one."
5031,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,4.0,"I am not doing to hot on this course, but being honest, it is on me. I think the only reason I am going to pass the class is because mr. primo has been reaching otu. seems like the man really cares. Good class."
5032,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,2.0,Willing to help anytime via video conferencing. Loved it.
5033,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1301,5.0,2.0,"This the best online course ever. Ibhave never received feedback like this before. Not a question, take mr primo class."
5034,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1301,2.0,5.0,Easy A! Just the basics of many different areas of digital media. I am taking Web 1 with Mr. Primo on the Fall.
5035,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,3.0,Professor Primo is good when it comes to lectures just not assignment. His assignment get really confusing ending this spring was not the best it made got worse after switched to fully-online due to the Covid-19 . For a first time taking a media Course I don't recommend Primo. Primo needs a better way explaining and giving assignments!
5036,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,WEBDESIGN1,5.0,2.0,"Most chill professor ever, I learned HTML and liked it! :O That is a combo."
5037,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,2.0,"Extremely clear expectations, I loved the detailed feedback. I did the work, got the grade, and againts all expectations I can actually code HTML and CSS. In the fall I am taking another class with Mr. Primo!"
5038,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,3.0,"Mr Primo is a great professor but for web design, we had to use different coding for every project and cant copy the codes from online or class too so its heartbreaking cause its very hard to make your own code when youre always confused lol but he gives good grade if you try your best tho"
5039,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1316,5.0,2.0,"Learning during a pandemic! I started this as a regular class and because of the virus it changed to online. I was afraid of online classes because of the quality. This class turned out to be really good. The videos explained the topics and I had the freedom to work at my own speed. Good class, and I am now willing to consider more online classes."
5040,935253,Juan,Primo,Lone Star College (all),Visual Communication,IMED1345,5.0,3.0,"I almost didn't finish teh course. Mr. Primo reached out, and somehow I manage to pass. He cares not many teachers do. I'm taking him again next semester and I think I will do better."
5042,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"She is such a awesome teacher, she really loves what shes talking about and makes it so easy to understand! The only work is a group project and essays that are simple if you go to class and understand the topic. She is also fast at replying to emails and care about her student."
5043,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,4.0,2.0,"Was supposed to be in person, but because if COVID we had to move online. She didnt really interact much. Self-paced &amp; just put all the work you needed to do on D2L. The worst part was the video quizzes that were only 3 questions each, so if you missed one you got a 66. Other than that she was ok, just wish she interacted more"
5044,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"This class is extremely fair. If you do what you are supposed to do(which is not much compared to other classes) there is no reason you can not pass. Professor Ashworth never took longer than 2 hours to respond to my emails, and her class is broken down into easily accomplishable weeks. Best online class I have ever had."
5045,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,4.0,3.0,"taking this class was one of the best choices i made this semester. it was a really fun class there is not a lot of pressure when it comes to he grade, as long as you can write you can pass the class. in this class i actually learned things about the government!!!!"

5047,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"Professor Ashworth is an amazing professor, very knowledgeable, and very passionate about her subject. She teaches you the way that you can see how the government is so important in your daily life. You have to complete a quiz for each chapter on Quizlet every week, the midterm is an essay, a presentation with a partner and a fina exam is an essay."
5048,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"Professor Ashworth is by far the best government teacher I've ever had. She makes sure to give everyone a chance to boil their opinions and then challenges them, regardless of what you believe. She remains completely unbiased during the entire class. The homework is pretty easy and she's a hard grader on essays, but she's always willing to help."
5049,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,"Professor Ashworth was a really amazing teacher. I had 2 essays, and 1 project. Homework is done through inquisitive! Really easy class, in which I learned a lot and definitely ended the semester a lot more open minded about government and politics then before. You can tell she really cares about her students."

5051,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,4.0,4.0,Professor Ashworth knows her stuff! She is a very cool relatable person and we didnt have a lot of work in that class except for two papers and a presentation!

She always helpful and always respect every different perspectives from students. Very knowledgeable, if you love GOVT or politics she is the best choice of your GOVT classes.

5053,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,"She was one of the best professor I have ever had. Her class is like conversations back and forth and made me actually understand how government works. We had one group project, but we got to choose our own partners.

Easy class and she is pretty clear on what her grading criteria is. No test, just inquisitive, a take home midterm paper, project, and in class final paper."
5057,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,4.0,2.0,"Professor Miranda, has a positive learning environment, she is nice but attendance is a must to pass in her class"

5061,2487089,Miranda,Ashworth,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"She is an amazing teacher! Shes very passionate about what she teaches. As long as you show up, take notes, do your homework thats not difficult, youll be fine. I enjoyed this class very much."
5063,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,Idk how he got 4.8 when he clearly deserves a 5. Prof. Really dumbs difficult math down and doesnt waste your time and money like most professors. I would take him for every subject if it were possible. What are you waiting for??? Sign up for him before others do!
5064,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,Professor Martin gives you YouTube links where he lectures about the homework and explains every process. He was very caring for the fact he made every homework assignment/midterm all due in December so it really helped me out due to Covid and my other classes. This class is definitely an easy A. I recommend just buying the access code for connect.
5065,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,2.0,"Professor Martin is a great math teacher! I was enrolled in the in-person class lecture before it was transitioned to online because of the Coronavirus Pandemic. His lecture before the pandemic were great. He also had Youtube videos which he created, in case if you wanted to look back at a particular math problem. This was an easy A class."
5066,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,"Homework videos explain everything you need to know, I recommend keeping the book open anyways to take notes and practice the MML resources!!! VERY flexible with the due dates, especially during the panda-demic. Free-style approach to learning, a schedule exists to get work done in a timely manner but it is merely a suggestion most of the time."
5067,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,2.0,Professor Martin was so easing going. He replied quickly to emails &amp; discussion questions &amp; really shows that he cared about his students success. MyMathLab is super easy to navigate &amp; the homework allows you to basically teach yourself. His midterm and final had reviews that you can use &amp; theyre exactly like the tests (diff #s). Loved this class
5068,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,"The perfect math professor. Opens assignments early, helps with videos for homework. This is the professor youve been looking for. If you dont get an A, thats on you!"
5069,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,2.0,"I took Math 1324 and Math 1325 online. The assignments are all on Pearson which I finished as soon as I can. The test reviews are exactly like the actual tests, just different numbers. I advise that you make your reviews very detail because you can use it during the tests as well as a calculator. At times, I forgot I was taking this class. Easy A!"
5070,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,STAT1342,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Martin is worth taking! He is very accessible and I learned so much even though it was a mini semester. He provides resources to help and explains everything. But please find your own resources to study and learn from, Statistics is not a piece of cake."
5071,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,"I took 2 classes at the same time, MATH 1324 &amp; 1325, felt like it was a single class due to the similarities between both, and how easy both were. I finished my homework within 3-4 weeks, study for mid-term and final few days before the test. Mid-term was taken at the test-center and final from home. SUPER EASY 10/10!!"
5072,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,He's the best math teacher I've ever had. I'm pretty average at math and managed to get 95! my advice is to NOT buy the textbook!! you just need the access code so don't but the textbook. I actually bought the textbook and i've never opened it (prof teaches very well and mathlab hw actually explains to you how to solve problems) GET HIS CLASS!
5073,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,I enjoy Math as much as I enjoyed taking this course with Professor Martin. YouTube lectures are very clear to understand each section of the homework in MyMathLab and to do well on them. There's also a midterm and final that must be taken at a testing center on paper and pencil. Just do the work and should be ready for those.
5074,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,"By far the best Math professor at Lone Star. Everything is done on Mymathlab but was available if you had questions. I did have to rely on Youtube a lot for clarification on some topics but for the most part, it was super easy and stress-free. Would not hesitate to take him again if I could."
5075,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,2.0,Great Professor. There are 4 exams (including the final). You are able to take the first 3 at home with two tries on mymathlab and use your notes. The final is taken at a testing center of your choice &amp; you are able to use notes as well. The hw has unlimited tries. Everything is essentially due on the last week of class. Take him!!
5076,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,1.0,Professor Martin is the best math professor I have ever taken. I love his teaching style because he makes the material it simple and understandable. He gives us a lot of time to complete our assignment. As long you put in the work you will pass with a good grade in this class. I will be taking him again for my next math course next semster.
5077,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,1.0,"I LOVED this class. I took a minimester there were 12 assignments total composed of 8 homework assignments with unlimited tries, 3 test, he gave a practice test with unlimited attempts that was identical to the test, the tests had 4 attempts, the final had an identical review and multiple attempts.I took everything from home. Easy A!!!"
5078,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,4.0,2.0,Professor Martin gives YouTube videos and notes explaining the material. He is very helpful and does respond quickly. My class was online and everything is due on one day then the final is due the last day of the class.
5079,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,2.0,"Professor Martin creates videos of the material that is being learned. The videos are easy to follow. Professor Martin is always happy to answer ALL the questions you can think of. I took him for a minimester and can honestly say if you simply study hard and don't slack, his class is very manageable! This course takes time, but again not difficult."
5080,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,1.0,"Math is my strongest subject but for some reason I could not pass Business Cal. I dropped this class two times but passed with an A with this professor. He is awesome. Hw is unlimited, so it gives you a chance to get a 100. Test and final you get 2 attempts. Im taking him again for 1324."
5081,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,"This was an online class, easy A! Very straightforward, around 5 homeworks for each test. There were 4 tests &amp; a final, he provided reviews that were exactly like the test. 2 attempts on tests and unlimited on homework. He offers tutorial videos for each section but with examples provided in homework, you can teach yourself. Would take again!"
5082,245062,Christopher,Martin,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,COMMCOR1010,5.0,1.0,"He's great! His lectures are very straight forward and he interacts with the class. Discussion isn't mandatory, but encouraged. He's approachable and he helps you until you understand the issue. He also makes the lectures relatable. Projects are not hard and tests are relatively easy if you understand the material."
5084,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"Dr Samuelson helped with papers every week, gave on-line open book tests, answered every email, and was always helpful during COVID. She also posted grade statistics from d2l, the class made As and Bs all semester."
5085,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Samuelson and other teachers at the college had to take the entire college semester on line with D2L and be available through the software, and their ability to teach on line. They all did a great job and deserve everyone's thanks and respect for saving our semester. I learned more about writing and literature than I ever knew."
5086,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"I took Prof. Samuelsons class online due to covid. She might have been an okay teacher in person, but holy crap she does not teach well online. Very confusing, not well planned, and unforgiving. If you have to take this class, please, do it in person. ONLINE SUCKS WITH HER."
5087,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,3.0,"This was supposed to be an in-person class, but due to covid, turned out to be online. Prof. Samuelson didn't adapt well at all to the online format; she was posting different dates in announcements than she was in dropbox, and she was very unclear in grading criteria. I'm sure she would have been great in-person, but online, DON'T TAKE THIS PROF"
5088,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2322,5.0,3.0,"Professor Joan provides a lot of lectures and videos to help students understand. She posts a lot of discussion board, but it isn't as hard, as long as you do them, you get a 100!"
5089,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2322,5.0,4.0,Taking her course during the summer term in the COVID Pandemic. Scary time with classes on line but she is so organized and compassionate things are going well for us. She emails and uploads announcements and reminders to keep us focused. In a major crisis you want teachers like these guys at lone star.
5090,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,4.0,2.0,"Professor Samuelson is extremely caring and wants the class to do well. But, you have to put in the work. I took British Literature and there was a decent amount of reading. The discussions were important, so you have to know the material to give good input. The material is super interesting, so it's not hard to do the work."
5091,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,3.0,4.0,If you struggle with English take another professor. Kicked a student out for not sitting up straight enough. Ive always gotten As in English and writing however in this class we were required to go to tutoring and to her office hours before turning in essays which I did and still got Bs
5092,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,I loved her. She helped me become a better writer. She has a lot of lectures posted on grammar and the feedback she leaves on your essays is very helpful. Shes very clear about what is due and when. She has a great sense of humor and is caring. She kept us updated on reliable Covid news. She is one of the best English teachers you will ever have.
5093,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"English is not my greatest subject; however, she is an incredible teacher that cares for her students. This was an online class. We had a total of 8 assignments total for the whole semester; which involved four essays, two exams, one quiz, and a Final Exam Essay. If you want an English teacher that cares, I recommend this professor."
5094,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2341,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Samuelson kept us posted on everything dealing with the Coronavirus as well as our college course. I'm grateful to know that I have such a wonderful teacher that is willing to guide her students through not only the college work, but the pandemic as well--an amazing teacher who truly cares for her students."
5095,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2341,5.0,3.0,"We had to change everything because of the COVID virus, and it was a scary time, but Dr. Samuelson took care of us."
5096,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,5.0,2.0,"I loved my experience in this class. If you are taking a heavy class load and need a class that isn't stressful, take this one! The whole class is made up of 10 easy discussion posts and 3 tests. The professor is very kind and cares about her students, even in online classes. DO NOT miss any of the homework or your grade will go down."
5097,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,This is the COVID-19 semester when we never returned from spring break. Dr. Samuelson moved into the on-line platform effortlessly because she knows exactly what she is doing and took excellent care of us. Students who follow directions and work with this experienced teacher got through a difficult time with her kindness and skill.
5098,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGLISH1301,3.0,5.0,When she says do something you better do it because if you dont itll hurt you in the long run.
5099,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,Samuelson is experienced and cares about students. Listen and do your job. Take your papers to her for help. You will be fine.
5100,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2322,4.0,3.0,I took her online Brit lit class and enjoyed it a lot. I wasn't looking forward to this class but with her good communication and organization it was great. She included many videos to help understand the hard readings that were funny and enjoyable. i really recommend y'all take her class. (:
5101,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,Dr. Samuelson helped us with special labs in her office the entire semester. I learned more from her about writing than I did in all of high school.
5102,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,2.0,4.0,"She literally yelled at the class for a solid 10 minutes for someone bringing their phone out. She thinks that semicolons are soooo important and that the world is trying to forget them, but newsflash ( and by the way make sure to pay attention to the news, because it's ""essential to the course"") ; are just a sentence pattern. stop wasting our time"
5103,465714,Joan,Samuelson,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2323,5.0,3.0,"Samuelson's lectures are really good, and I enjoyed the blog writing we did every week . It inclded short essay, media choices, and reading other students posts. Exams can be tough, so you have to study the book and Samuelson's lectures."
5105,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1301,5.0,3.0,I am not crazy about writing but Dr Tate is a great professor. Her online stuff is very clear &amp; organized. I found the sample papers &amp; chances to rewrite the papers to be lifesavers. Her Webex sessions make me wish I could take her class inperson. Just do the work and take it seriously. I am making As on papers in my other classes because of hers.
5106,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2327,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr Tate's 8 weeks class online, I really enjoyed it. It was well organized, everybody knew when and what they had to do. She gives interesting feedback. Also, She will provide you with audios, take them seriously, they helped a lot in comprehending the readings. It was my pleasure being in her class. I will be glad to take her again."
5107,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2327,5.0,4.0,"I have the pleasure of participating in her online course, she amazingly happened to make it feel like is an in-person lecture, she uses audios with clear explanations and highlights the important facts to take away. She can build a personal relationship with her students even from an online platform. Excellent professor!"
5108,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2327,5.0,3.0,"I have just completed Dr. Tate's course and love the comprehensive dives into literature and how they correlate to history. Her lectures are awesome and give life to what you are reading. Tests include multiple answer types. Course wasn't overtly homework heavy, minus the reading. You will leave the course feeling more intelligent. Take this class!"
5109,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2327,5.0,4.0,"I'll be honest, at first, I absolutely did not want to take this class because of how fast it went (8 wks)and the fact that English was not my strong suit. Coming out of this class now, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely take it again if I had the choice. I learned more about American Literature than I thought I ever would!"
5110,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,3.0,4.0,6+ page articles u have to read for hw everyday. U will have a quiz n talk about the article the next day. Participation WILL help u be successful. She has VERY good lectures on how to write essays. She will teach u step by step. U dnt really have to take notes bc she gives u packets of notes. Essays will be over the articles. A lot of word count
5111,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2322,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tate is so sweet. I got indepth feedback on every major exam and discussion (a first for me in an online class). This teachers communication is consistent, personal and kind. I loved the in depth reviews and the lecture audios and great comments in the individual emails. I felt like I was set up for success. Great class and even better prof."
5112,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2327,5.0,3.0,"One thing I look for on this website is the number of reviews. Im not surprised Prof Tate has 170+ reviews because she is awesome. Having finished the class, I see most are spot on. Do the work and use the guides is golden advice. Listen to the audios. Ignore the sour grapes reviews from lazy students who were looking for a gimme."
5113,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2322,5.0,3.0,"I love this online teacher. In her final announcement, she told us that 20 people made an A. You cannot beat that. Her class IS a lot of reading to do in only 6 weeks but she is upfront about the load and her expectations. I got the most helpful feedback that I have ever had in any online class. Shes truly awesome in every way."
5114,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2322,5.0,4.0,"As long as you listen to her audio lectures and read what is assigned, maintaining an A is very possible. Even though she is an online teacher, her lectures provide a face-to-face vibe and help throughout the readings."
5115,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2327,5.0,3.0,"Professor Tate was one of the best English professors I've had. It's definitely not an easy A, but I have learned more from her class than I ever thought I would. I would definitely reccomend if you're interested in Literature."
5116,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2327,5.0,3.0,I definitely recommend taking Dr. Tate. There is reading homework every other day with fair quizzes that are easy A's if you read. She gives test review lectures that are very beneficial for each exam and the discussions for each unit are graded fairly. The best time I have had in an online class so far!
5117,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2322,5.0,2.0,TAKE HER PLEASE! She is such an amazing professor who takes the time to give you feedback! I was so thankful that I took her 6 week summer 2020 course during a pandemic. She was so nice and understands you. Listen to her lectures and study the study guide and you will do phenomenal in the class!
5118,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2322,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Tate is definitely hands down one of the best teachers I've had. She really dives in when she teaches and gives you a new perspective. You do have to put in work to get a good grade though. Her review audios and study guide set you up for success, so make sure to listen to them!!!! - and don't worry, her lectures are pretty interesting :)"
5119,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2327,5.0,4.0,Dr. Tate is a great professor. You will have to put forth work and read but if you do the work it is an easy A.

5120,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2332,5.0,4.0,"Whenever you take this class, be serious or you will not make a passing grade because this class is heavily about reading and understanding. You have read head the lecture in order not to overwhelming before the test day. If you keep track on studying, plan careful, you may get what grade you need. She is nice and open-mind"
5121,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG2322,1.0,5.0,"Do not listen to these reviews, do not take this class. Dr. Tate's class was unnecessarily ridiculously hard due to its HEAVY work load and difficult tests. Studying and reading takes up the entire day and she deliberately tries to trick you on the true and false questions on the tests. This class was the worst class I have ever taken!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5122,439336,Rebecca,Tate,Lone Star College (all),English,BRIT2322,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Tate is the best English professor I ever had.

She knows that writing a paper can be hard and takes her time preparing you, to write the perfect essay. You will not get ""thrown to the wolves"" with her. Also, her readings are very interesting and fun especially the fiction pieces. I HIGHLY recommend her for both English and Literature."
5126,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOLOGY2420,5.0,5.0,I was skeptical about taking Professor Anaya after reading the older reviews Im so glad i took him. Text book is not needed. Each exam has a study guide! Makes life much easier! Gives extra credit! Ive retained so much knowledge that i now consider myself to be a germaphobe! TAKE HIM. I PROMISE YOU WONT REGRET it! I got an A in his class!
5127,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"Professor Anaya is amazing! Take him! you won't regret it. The textbook is free but you don't need to use it since he gives you summaries to review and that's all you need to do for the tests. He can be strict in labs but it is only because he cares about his student's health. He is a great professor, very knowledgeable. You won't regret taking him"
5128,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,3.0,GREAT professor! Took as a hybrid but never went into lab sessions due to Covid. Tests are easy if u write out notes for each of the chapters. TAKE THE BONUS QUIZZES!THEY HELP SO MUCH!There are 3 or 4 per Unit and they help ur grade &amp; help u study. His review sheets are VERY accurate for whats on the test. No essays. Take him if you wanna succeed
5129,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"Dr Anaya is one of the best teachers I've had. 1st day in lab I was a little put off by his strictness but it all makes sense now, given what we were going to be handling in lab. Due to the pandemic everything, incl. labs got moved online, but his class is well organized and you don't even need the *free* textbook listed for his course."
5130,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2024,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Anaya lab was strict but I can understand the importance. He gives plenty of extra credit. no need for the book. Just read the summaries, do quizlet, crossword &amp; watch the lecture videos you should be good. I worked 40+ hours and was able to make a B+, with all the extra credit I made an A+. He is a good teacher just do your work you'll be fine"
5131,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"Professor Anaya is a great professor and human, he is very understanding and will go out of his way to help you anyway he can.

5132,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"An excellent instructor who goes out of his way to cover all bases for different learning styles such as crosswords, lecture videos and chapter info packets over each chapter with a LOT of info, but the EXACT info you need to succeed in this class. FREE TEXT (but not needed). A LOT of extra credit. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Anaya - one of the best!"
5133,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,5.0,"Study the outlines thoroughly. You dont need the textbook. He offers the lab manual for free. Great teacher overall. Adapted well with converting labs to online during COVID-19. The only thing bad I have to say, which is why he didnt get 5 stars, is because he teaches the class for nurses. He doesnt care about other health professionals."
5134,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,4.0,4.0,"I took Professor Anaya during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was given all the materials I needed to be successful but my grade wasn't what I expected it to be (I'm an A B student) this is the fault of my own as I didn't manage my time properly or study enough. As I just mentioned, time management and studying are KEY! Do both and you will be fine!"
5135,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,3.0,"Love Dr Anaya. I got an A in the class, but I worked for it. Great teacher and always avaliable to help. I would definatley take him again. Be prepared to work"
5136,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,"I took Dr. Anaya's Medical Micro hybrid class. He is an awesome teacher, he gives a lot of work but, they are necessary assignments to pass the tests and the class. If you do the work you will pass. He gave great feedback for assignments and offers extra credit. Overall, if you do the work stay on track with your assignments you will pass &amp; learn !"
5137,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,3.0,"Professor Anaya is hands down the best professor Ive had at Lone Star. Yes there is a lot of school work in this class but he gives you everything you need to pass. Professor Anaya was so understanding with the COVID-19 pandemic. I learned so much in this class. If you have to take this class, take it with Prof Anaya. You will not regret it!"
5138,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,5.0,"GREAT teacher. Many extra credit opportunities, DO THEM! The extra credit saved me! He is very clear and keeps you interested with his wit and straight forward style of teaching. He is quick to respond to any questions. As long as you focus, DO THE WORK, and extra credit, you will do great!"
5139,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,5.0,"I started the semester off taking his hybrid. Well, coronavirus stepped in and I wasnt able to go to my labs. He offers everything you need to pass for free. You HAVE to read the outlines. I didnt even read the textbook and I passed with a B. He offers so much extra credit. I got around 30 extra points. He DOES require a webcam for bonus pt quiz."
5140,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"By far one of the best professors, I took the hybrid class that was later transition to all online due the the pandemic. But let me tell you he is organized you dont need to buy a book he gives all the material you need pass and succeed. This semester was not easy due to sudden changes, but I manage to pass with an A."
5141,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,3.0,This man knows his stuff! 1st day he tells us about this new virus spreading in China &amp; how it is going to come here. This was early January so I looked at him like he was crazy! He kept warning us &amp; helped us prepare for what is happening now! You can tell that he loves what he does &amp; he really cares about his students. Take him!
5142,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,1.0,4.0,"I took his hybrid class. Tests are hard but if you memorize his chapter summaries you will survive. He runs his classroom by intimidation and if you do what he wants you wont have consequences. Not much respect towards students. Please take someone else, it was an awful experience and Im speaking for about 85% of my class."
5143,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"Don't let the negative reviews trick you!!!! this is a hard subject, and you must study a lot no matter who you take. Dr. Anaya is straight forward, tells you exactly what to do to pass. DO NOT MISS A LAB EVER!. Do the puzzles, and do every single one of the bonus assignment because that will ump your grade. Listen to the instructions and follow."
5144,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Anaya is a fantastic professor! His class is difficult and he is strict in labs, but if you put in the work you will succeed. He gives many opportunities for extra credit and provides several different platforms for studying to ensure you grasp the material i.e. crossword puzzles, quizlets, &amp; review sheets. I highly recommend his class!"
5145,790490,Steve,Anaya,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"First, Micro is not easy. Dr. Anaya is one of the best professors I have ever had. He condenses chapters down to summaries for you to study from and also provides a lot of bonus opportunities. He is strict in lab, but if you can't handle that then you can't handle nursing school. If you put in the time and effort, it is not difficult to get an A."
5147,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,5.0,4.0,"The online class was very organized. Assignments are related to the textbook. The professor gives clear directions and enough time to complete three reports, three exams, and one research paper. His response to email is quick and friendly. He has a big passion to support students. Although taking this course in summer was tough, it was great."
5148,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,Prof. Plank is really nice! He is really helpful and nice. He answers email very quickly. And you will do well based on reading textbook! I really enjoyed! And highly recommand Prof. Plank!
5149,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,4.0,"I took his 6-week summer class &amp; it was hard work. Lots of essays. Although I had a love-hate relationship with writing, I really did enjoy his class. If you want to actually learn, this class is amazing! Super supportive &amp; sends quick emails. Offers advice/ help for essays! Hes genuine &amp; passionate in teaching students :) Attendance adds points"
5150,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,2.0,4.0,"Took his summer 6 week course, class was needlessly hard. 3 two-essay tests, 4 more two-page essay assignments, and a 9 page research paper to top it off. His time management is terrible but is willing to help slightly. If you just want the credit, do NOT take this class"
5151,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,5.0,4.0,"Took as an online 6 weeks summer course. All assignments/tests are minimum two-page papers, but the criteria is very clear and gives great feedback when grading. He makes you work for the A, but if you put in the work, you will easily pass and really learn something about government/politics along the way. Very nice and responds to emails quickly."
5152,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,4.0,3.0,Provides good feedback on your writing in order to help you improve. The class isn't difficult you just have to be willing to read.
5153,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HIS CLASS BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE BEATS YOU TO IT! I never had a teacher as understanding, caring, and inspirational in college as Professor Plank. He had weekly Webex meetings that doubled as extra credit. Also, because I had to work during his WebEx meetings, he even offered to hold weekly private Webex meetings with me."
5154,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,3.0,4.0,"If you are looking for an easy A or B and are needing to take it just for credit, this is not the one. If you are wanting to do A LOT of research/writing and truly understand how to federal government works to the point you could run for Congress? This is for you. He is very nice and responds quickly, but it was way more work than anticipated."
5155,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,3.0,4.0,"Took him for a 6-week online summer course. EVERY assignment and grade was a minimum two-page paper. He gives good feedback and is fantastic at responding very quickly to emails, but be prepared to WRITE."
5156,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,Do not do the minimum amount of work for your papers! Great professor overall.
5157,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,"With the current situation, he did well adjusting the class to online. There was no slacking to achieve my A. Originally there's 3 tests and a research paper, which turned to 1 test already taken in school before, 2 test papers, research paper, &amp; quick weekly assignments. This class actually educated me of the government and its importance."
5158,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"Professor Plank was great and he made jokes throughout lectures to keep everyone entertained. We had 3 tests and a research paper, along with a few other response assignments. If you're doing his class online, know that he will expect quality papers so be thorough! As long as you analyze the content you should be fine! I would recommend him! :)"
5159,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,4.0,"If you are looking to get your federal government credit out of the way, Professor Plank is not for you. However, if you're looking to put a lot into a class and to get a lot out, Professor Plank is a real gem who rewards you for genuine interest and participation. I will honestly miss him, his little jokes, and his passion for student learning."
5160,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"I was skeptical about Professor Plank's class at first, but after taking it, he is one of the best professors I've ever had. Paying attention in class is important because he explains everything so well. He gives reviews for all the tests and clearly outlines what he expects in papers, making it easy to ace. I would definitely take this class again"
5161,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,There are three tests throughout the semester and one 8-12 page essay. He gives reviews for all tests and gives you enough time to study and work on your essay. He really encourages participation and he'll even give you extra credit if you do! He's also a pretty funny guy!!
5162,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,"He made government interesting and easy to understand and actually learn. If he taught 2306 I would take again. All you have to do is show up and you will pass. It is all lectures, no homework, but 3 exams in which he gives reviews for. As well as an 8-10 page essay in which he does not grade heavy."
5163,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,"Professor Plank has been one of the best professors I have taken by far, he always tries to make the lecture interesting and enjoyable, he is also very light on work with having only on assignment."
5164,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVTH2305,5.0,4.0,"Professor Plank is great and really wants his students to succeed. That being said you will have to put in the work to succeed, he does make class enjoyable. He has alot of great stories and information. PUT IN EFFORT and you will do well."
5165,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,"Government can be a boring class but he makes class fun by showing funny videos and telling stories about his life! He is what is required and expected. He tells you EVERYTHING you need to know so pay attention in class and read the textbook! If you put in effort, you will do well! I used to not follow politics, but now after his class, I want to!"
5166,1312090,Methias,Plank,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,5.0,3.0,"Took Summer course and it was graded by 3 tests and a 7-10 page paper, pretty easy course and the professor was super nice and caring. Would recommend this professor if youre willing to take this course."
5168,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,ANATOMYAND240,5.0,1.0,"Professor Jackson is the best in A&amp;P , she made it so easy for me. I took her for summer 2. She always gets back to you, it doesnt matter the time or day and she takes her time with the online class. She explain things to your lowest understanding. I love her."
5169,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,2.0,"Mrs Jackson's Nutrition class was my favorite class to-date. She is lecture heavy, which I love - but she lets you work at your own pace, as long as you meet deadlines accordingly. I learned SO MUCH in this course which helped me in AP2 tremendously. Take notes, LOOK AT THE POWER POINTS (tests), do the work, make an A"
5170,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,1.0,"Professor Jackson is a kindhearted professor that genuinely cares about you and your grades. The paper was the assignment that I found most difficult but I aced it. All of the tests were on quizlet and the assignments were super easy and simple to complete. I appreciated how little I had to work for an A in this class, especially with how busy i am"
5171,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"The Micro class has three lectured tests, one final (not cumulative), 3 practicals, a project, and a bunch of random little assignments such as notebook checks and quizzes. It's a cool class, and she teaches in a way that makes you engaged. There are labs every day you need to go to, and she always gives useful test reviews before tests/practicals."
5172,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,3.0,4.0,"She is a nice person, but her class is difficult. Do not be fooled by the AP ratings. Her micro class is totally different. There are 4 exams and a final (so 5 total) three practical exams and 2-3 lab write up ever class. Her first two tests are very difficult! She says to use the textbook, the book is shallow for 1st 2 exams. After it get easier."
5173,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,2.0,"Professor Jackson is by far the best at teaching anatomy. She makes lecture relatable and memorable by cracking jokes all while making sure no one is lost with the material. She tells you exactly what to study for when it comes to exams, provides reviews and great feedback. Will be taking AP2 with her in the near future!"
5174,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO1322,5.0,1.0,"I don't know what to begin with this fabulous professor. Honestly, she is such a sweet, caring, and hilarious professor.

Shes very understanding and Im very thankful that I was in her class.
5178,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL1322,5.0,2.0,She is a very laid back professor. Her tests are not hard and are pretty straight forward. These tests require a little bit of studying. You can learn quite a bit from the lectures. Homework is minimal. If this class is taken semi-seriosly then it is an easy A.
5179,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO1322,5.0,3.0,Wonderful professor. I was not looking forward to nutrition at all. I assumed it would be boring but I really learned a lot and enjoyed her class. My family and I have been making better food choices since I took her class too. Couldnt recommend her more!

The easiest (science)class I've taken- she's straight forward and doesn't make you learn uneccessary things."
5182,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Jackson was a complete angel, she really cares for you and will take extra time to teach you one on one if your not understanding. Gives extra credit."

Will miss this class and her!"
5187,1151636,Melissa,Jackson,Lone Star College (all),Biology,AP1,4.0,2.0,"she's makes it easy to pass the course by giving us reviews that are spot on with the test. Study her reviews, don't waste your time reading the notes &amp;textbook. she'll tell you exactly what is on the test. With the other instructors you may have to spend time learning the information. With miss Jackson's class just memorize the information"
5189,1983385,Misty,Sabol,Lone Star College (all),Business,HRPO2306,4.0,1.0,Very good teacher. Helps you when you reach out to her if thee is a problem. Give you all the information needed in her syllabus.

There were A LOT of entitled students in the class who felt like they shouldn't be responsible for reading or participating in discussions, but this is a college course. Honestly, an easy college course and I do not like history. We had one assignment (a paper or a test) every week, and he does have deadlines. I'd take him again."
5211,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Don't be intimidated by his syllabus; He's just really upfront with what is expected. 4 exams over the free textbook (YAWP), 1 exam over a video, and 2 papers. All were doable. Grades things quickly. Don't slack off though because he doesn't take any late work, nor will he extend deadlines. All tests are due Saturday so plan accordingly!"
5212,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"Took him for summer session 1, &amp; was the easiest class ever! He's the best! Only had to do 10/15 discussion questions in total. We had 2 papers with a min. of 750 words each, 5 exams &amp;1 final. Everything is super easy, he gives you the link to the textbook &amp; the final exam is the study guide. He doesn't accept late work! Everything is worth 10%."

5215,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,4.0,2.0,"Professor Neumeyer does NOT accept late work, which kept my procrastination under check! You have 1 EASY paper at the beginning, 1 discussion post a week (only need to do 10/15), and all tests are online only on Saturday's. I never read the book and passed!!! He is straight forward, fast grader. If you have a full load this is an easy class to take"
5216,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST13011302,5.0,2.0,I took a US History Dual Credit class in high school for my junior year and Mr. Neumeyer was my teacher. He is really good at teaching the material and making it enjoyable to learn. It was a fun class to be in and it was easy to learn the material. There are only 10 grade and the work load isn't heavy and is very manageable to get an A in the class
5217,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"Professor Neumeyer created a course that is just as practical as it gets. 10 grades, 100 points each. Read everything you are supposed to and you will have no trouble getting an A. His discussions make you think. His final is the most difficult part, you must read two books. It's not that bad though. I'd take this class again in a heartbeat."
5218,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"This was a pretty easy 8-week course. Everything is laid out for you however, you're tested on three chapters a week. But it's pretty cool because there is no homework or anything so if you're up for it go for it! I loved it!"
5219,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"3 weeks class: 10 discussions, 5 pages essay, 5 tests in a free online book, 1 final in 2 other books, all grade is equal and worth 12.5%."
5220,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"took the 3 week mini. there's 4 tests: each over 3 chapters from the online textbook that's free. very simple essay to write, he tells you exactly what he wants. final was over 2 books that you have to purchase. you have to read and take notes like any other class and you'll be good!"
5221,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Great Class, just do the work and you can make an easy a if you put in effort."
5222,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"I took this class as a 3-week mini. It was the expected amount of work. As long as you complete 10 out of 20 discussion posts then you should be fine. The tests are word for word in the online book he gives a link for. You will need a book for the discussions. Each test is 50 question final is 100, one easy essay. KEEP UP WITH DATES."
5223,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Took this class as a minister and by far the easiest course I've taken. Graded by 5 quizzes over chapters in the textbook, a paper, 10 discussions, and a final exam based on a book. The professor was considerate and provided a free online textbook! All you have to do is read and complete the quizzes. Would recommend professor Neumeyer to everyone!"
5224,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"I am one to not particularly like history or having to read but taking this class online has been really simple. Lots of reading.. 5 chapter tests, 3 chapters per test. 2 discussion weeks. A paper and a final. Sounds like a lot but it was fairly easy. Also his feedback response is very fast and he keeps grades up to date!"
5225,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Professor Neumeyer clearly states what is expected in his course. If you put forth the effort, you will do great. I thoroughly enjoyed writing the papers assigned. Strange, I know but I found the material that the papers were to be written about, very interesting. My only regret is that I didn't take this class in person."
5226,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"The best professor I have ever had! Professor Neumeyer gives you clear instructions on assignments and tests that if followed will earn you an A. No late work is accepted, but you are given plenty of time to finish assignments before deadlines. This class is difficult to fail, just turn in your assignments and read the textbook and you will pass."
5227,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST13011302,5.0,2.0,"Took 1301 &amp; 1302 online, made an A in both. He gives good lecture powerpoints. He's pretty straightforward on how essays are graded, if you do as he states you can make 100. I used my text in 1301, then for 1302 I just googled what I needed to know from the powerpoints. And like all online classes, just keep up with your due dates."
5228,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Neumeyer is great, he makes learning history fun, he gives out prizes for participation and his slide shows are bluntly funny and a little quirky. Absolutely no eating in class. The class is lecture heavy and there are only a few grades. However, his essays are decently easy and the tests and quizzes are alright if you study and do the review."
5229,130820,Randy,Neumeyer,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"He gives out the weirdest prizes sometimes for answering questions. I have at least 10 expired Wendy's coupons, 3 wallet sized pictures of him, a vinyl record, and a lifetime of nightmares. I felt like I studied 70s music more than history. 10/10 would take again."
5231,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,4.0,Professor Johnson made herself available and communicated with us making the class less stressful and it also cleared up questions that I may have had. She is willing to help you get through the course- she wants you to do well. I learned a lot and I was glad I took her course.
5232,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,"I loved the fact that I could work ahead of time. Its such a relief having a planner to see what you are getting into the new week. I loved this class. Straight forward and to the point. Just get it done so both you and the teacher are happy, just how it should be."
5233,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,Very responsive and always ready to help
5234,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"This professor is pretty good. I already knew how computers worked for the most part so this was pretty easy. I will say, I cannot stand the weekly Microsoft assignments given. Its not hard, just torture for me. It moves so slow even at 1.5 speed. This class is great other than that."
5235,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,"She is a very clear and straight forward teacher. She replies to emails quickly, she is very helpful when answering questions. She is also a fast grader and offers extra credit. The class is not too much if you manage your time wisely."
5236,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COS1301,4.0,3.0,"Professor Johnson is very clear on what she expects from her students, no late work is accepted and responds quickly to emails."
5237,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,She is very caring and very helpful. I took her for summer one and do not regret it and you wont either. Love the hands on in this course if you are familiar with Microsoft then should not have an issue passing.
5238,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,2.0,"I took Professor Johnson's Summer session class and thoroughly enjoyed it! Professor Johnson grades quickly and is always available to answer questions. She has a detailed list of expectations but none of them are overly difficult to accomplish. If you take the time to study, you will pass with no problems. Take Professor Johnson!"
5239,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Johnson is very good. This specific class I'm taking right now is online, but its very organized, and she grades really quickly. Read the text and do the quizzes/assignments and you'll be able to pass easily."
5240,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"Great class. The class was well structured organized, grading system was clear. Even in a short six week semester I finished early. I highly recommend this instructor, quick with feedback and very fair to her students."
5241,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,"Prof Johnson is always up to date, this was an online class but within minutes or to an hour she will update the grade that way you are always know of your current status of the class grade wise. Her instructions are clear and organized and always sends out reminders."
5242,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,4.0,"Took COSC 1301 for Summer I and It was pretty easy. The class moves very quickly and there are a lot of assignments , readings, and module trainings due each week but you have the whole week to turn them in. Don't procrastinate, use your time wisely, plan ahead, PAY ATTENTION (your grade depends on it) to the material and you'll do just fine."
5243,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,"Margaretha Johnson as a professor has been clear, concise and timely with all information we need as students to succeed in her course. For this course specifically we used a Cengage program, and she made sure to give us a timeline in the syllabus to plan out our classwork, and allowed us to work ahead, even opening the final exam early."
5244,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Johnson is AWESOME. There are so many easy ways to earn extra credit, the lectures are time consuming but EASY. She makes it really easy to earn an A! She responds to emails in a timely manner and truly cares for her students. I wish all other professors were like her. TAKE HER CLASS!! You won't regret it. :)"
5245,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,Extremely helpful and caring. Really want to make sure you have everything you need to pass her class!
5246,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,Amazing class. The professor is amazing. She is very cooperative and gives kind and great feedback. The schedule is super flexible and the work is super easy. I would 10/10 recommend this course and this professor.
5247,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"Pretty good Professor, I missed a few assignments the first week and she allowed me to submit them the next week."
5248,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Johnsons class is by far, the most organized online class Ive taken. She responds in a timely manner and gives good feedback. Read the book, complete the assignments and youll pass the class."
5249,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,Professor Johnson is such a sweet lady. She is very quick on entering grades and responding to emails which I appreciate. I'm currently taking the mini semester for COSC 1301. There is a good amount of assignments to complete but nothing to difficult. I would definitely recommend her to a friend.
5250,593719,Margaretha,Johnson,Lone Star College (all),Computer &amp; Informational Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,She was a great professor and will answer you in a matter of hours if not minutes. I would take her again.
5252,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,5.0,"She's literally the worst professor I've ever had, don't take online, she doesn't actually teach a thing her reviews are a joke does nothing to help review for exams, her labs don't do anything, but confuse you more on the subject she failed to teach you, and her feedback is the most hilarious not wanting showing how we messed up, she should retire"
5253,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,5.0,She is the worst and rudest professor I have ever met. She could yell at you for everything you did wrong. No caring for her student. She put herself above anyone and no respectful to students. Never ever take her class again.
5254,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,4.0,I felt as if she was all over the place . She does curve so it helps MANY students. Her test are somewhat difficult.
5255,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,1.0,"I took and withdrew from her class Fall of 2019. I decided to take her hybrid class since it was my 2nd time retaking chem2. She treats her students as if we are children (assigned seating), talks down, and always talks about herself. My mom was diagnosed with cancer so I needed extra time on her DIFFICULT lab reports, she did not care."
5256,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,2.0,5.0,"I gave this teacher a chance for Hybrid. The reviews pushed me to select her. First day, okay! Good story teller. First lessons, NO WAY! Increasingly got harder &amp; I tried my best. Tutoring every single day. Everyone was lost, excepts for people who already have degrees. No study guides. TEST ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS. She is caring but insanely hard!"
5257,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,5.0,"Horrible teacher. Ridicules her students and the only subject she really cares about is herself. Lonestar needs to get rid of her, she's absolutely wretched as a teacher and shouldn't even be teaching high school chemistry."
5258,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1411,1.0,5.0,"All the positive reviews have been written by Lourella. She writes the same thing over and over about how she teaches life skills too, pathetic. Chemistry is already difficult, she is much better at putting her students down than teaching anything. Please be aware she is desperately trying to raise her ratings here as she is a lousy teacher."
5259,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,2.0,5.0,"Hybrid course No study guides Quiz each Friday Quizlet WONT help you Good story teller, but confusing lectures Precise, long &amp; thorough Lab Reports Deducts points for everything on paper Toughest grader High expectations &amp; strict She does yell, but nothing crazy Wouldn't recommend this class at all unless you have a STRONG Chem foundation"
5260,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM14111412,5.0,4.0,"I have completed all of my chemistry requirements but felt that I did not learn anything from my previous professors. I was to go to great university, so I decided to enroll in Prof. Cruz.... I learned so many things (not just chemistry) that are very important in life. My university professors were impressed of my chemistry foundation!"
5261,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM14111412,5.0,4.0,"Although I truly wanted an A, I am very happy to have obtained a B because I learned so much from Professor Cruz, not only in chemistry but in other fields outside of the classroom. She truly cares for the success of the students, not just teaching chemistry. I also see other professors asking for her advise and help in their teaching."
5262,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher I've had I think ever. I took her because it was the only time I could take chem 2 and much regretted it. Be wary of the positive reviews here, multiple reviews posted on the same day all saying how she inspired students in life as well as Chemistry?? That's a pretty sad tactic and absolutely something she would do..."
5263,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,2.0,4.0,"The labs are so time-consuming &amp; her hybrid class is outlined very poorly. She changed the outline thruout the semester twice. she will not post any grade on D2L either. You will asker a question and she will talk for a long time, not giving u an answer. She also said edition 11 was required but all her power points reference editions 8,9 and 10."
5264,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM14111412,5.0,4.0,"Professor Cruz is the best professor I ever had, and I have gone to different colleges and universities already. She treats everyone well regardless of whether you're smart or not, different culture, etc. She explains the topics so that everyone can relate and understand. When a chapter is boring, she makes is interesting and fun. I love her."
5265,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM14111412,5.0,4.0,"I already have a Bachelor's degree but came back to take more courses to prepare me for Grad School in a STEM major. At first I was so nervous because I am older than other students. But Prof. Cruz made me feel ""at home"". She suggested a lot of methodology and strategy to help students do well in class. I did and I learned a lot! Got an A, too."
5266,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM14111412,5.0,5.0,"I took this class last semester and did not learn anything although I passed the course. Then I enrolled in Prof. Cruz class and was just blown away by what I have discovered and learned, not just about Chemistry but practical life as well. Great professor and wonderful person!"
5267,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,5.0,"DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! At first she seems good but she only wants you to pay attention to her stories and barely get to the lesson. She doesn't let you use a TI-84 calculator for anything, wants you to print out the lectures ahead of time and judges you by writing your name down."
5268,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Cruz is by far the worst. At one point told the entire class we ""have no initiate, how will we ever get hired"". She will yell and belittle you if you ask questions. She scolds you and take names down. She talks too much about herself and her brothers. She gives giant curves cause her grading criteria is poo."
5269,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,4.0,I took her because there were some good reviews. Horrible decision. She makes her own powerpoints and expects you to print them and bring them to class. Doesn't want students taking notes by hand (if you do she writes your name down and won't give you any favors). Is very strict over the small things. I payed attention but lectures are confusing
5270,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,4.0,I am an honor student and tried to stick it out until I knew it will affect my GPA. Time and time again I approached her and she turned me down in clarying my questions and refused to meet me outside of office hours. I had classes during her office hours so meeting was impossible. She had favorites in her class and I didn't fit her mold.
5271,780207,Lourella,Cruz,Lone Star College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1412,1.0,5.0,"I am currently taking her for Chemistry II, and she is literally the worst professor I've ever had. She constantly yells at everyone during lab sessions, very confusing lectures, she will belittle you and humiliate you each time you do something wrong. She will seem like an awesome professor at first, but will make you want to cry by the 2nd week."
5273,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Professor C, is so caring for her class. Her lectures are interesting and her assignments are easy. She is one of those professors that does not have her class buy any textbooks because she understands her students may not be able to, especially with times right now. You can tell she loves teaching. I definitely recommend for everyone to take her!"
5274,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,Easiest government class I've ever taken. She made it easy to understand and had a low amount of projects for us. She was also very understanding if we were not able to attend so long as you told her in advance.
5275,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"I cannot tell you how awesome Prof. Twitchell is!! I took this class based on the good ratings and was not sure if she was going to live up to them. My first assignment was a mess and she pointed out my mistakes (and gave me another chance). After that, I just followed instructions and learned the material (she makes it easy). Highly recommend!!"
5276,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"I took the 6-week summer course, 2 tests which are the midterm, and the final exam and about 5 or 6 assignments. Her class is very easy, you can use your guided vocabs on the tests and most of the material comes from her videos, some you do have to use the provided websites. Highly recommend."
5277,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,Best teacher I have ever taken at lone star! She really cares about her students and you can tell in her lectures. After every assignment she gives feedback on what you need to improve on or if you did really good. She is really funny and makes the class enjoyable. I will definitely take her for all of my future history classes!
5278,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,Professor Twitchell is an amazing teacher. I truly wish all my teachers were like her. Clear instructions for all assignments.
5279,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,GOVT1301,5.0,2.0,Professor Twitchell is amazing! She is passionate about her work and her classes are never a bore. I would totally recommend taking her class!
5280,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND COMPLETE THE GUIDED VOCABS YOU WILL DO GREAT! 2 TESTS AND A PAPER. SHE IS AMAZING AND PROVIDED US HELP DURING COVID 19. I WOULD RECOMMEND HER FOR ALL HISTORY AND GOVERNMENT CLASSES.
5281,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,I LOVE TWITCHELL!! She was the best history professor I have ever had. She takes her time to record lectures for her online students and actually teach unlike most professors in an online class. The grades were very easy but somewhat a lot of work. You will be prepared for the 2 exams with the vocab assignments. She is awesome! Take her!!!!!!!!!!!!
5282,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"I will make this simple for you: if you want to take either hist 1301/1302 or govt 2305, THIS IS YOUR BEST CHOICE. Mrs. Twitchell is such a sweet, compassionate &amp; comprehensive professor that wants you to learn interesting things and pass. We did not have any tests and had to do a vocab once a week where she would post videos talking about them."
5283,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"Only graded by vocab (really long and confusing), 2 tests (midterm and final which are cumulative from each section up to each exam) and a PowerPoint which was 20% of the grade. She is a hard professor. I would not recommend this teacher for anyone due to her workload. Switched to a different professor and got an actual grade with different things"
5284,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,Her class was very easy for me. She was super funny in her lectures and her class if definitely an easy A if you just do the assignments. Its basic vocabulary you must get from her videos. Each vocab ws took me about 1.5 hrs so prepare. She is a great choice for online though!
5285,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"Such an eye opening professor. She was VERY passionate about what she was teaching and made lectures something to enjoy. Tests are over the material covered in the lectures so if you miss, it's up to you to watch her presentations to get the info. Very fun and I would 10/10 take this class again!"
5286,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,4.0,2.0,"This was one of the best classes that I have ever taken. I took this class on Saturdays and I drove over an hour to get there from Conroe, TX. Professor T made the class very interesting. She is a very caring person. I truly learned a lot in this class. The course load is manageable for those with busy schedules. Do the work and you will pass."
5287,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,TAKE HER!!! This professor is definitely accessible outside the classroom. She inspires you to learn something every time. Her amazing and funny lectures was what got me an A+ on her Exams. She gives you hope to learn about History. She is very upfront and from the beginning she will say YOU GOT THIS! SHE IS BY FAR THE BEST TEACHER IN HISTORY!!!!!
5288,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Great Hybrid Class, did learn a Ton! I would definitely recommend her, she is Hilarious! Keep in mind she does her twitchcast with that being said pay close attention to them they are the key to getting good grades for vocab. And you also learn. Also, go to class you will not regret it!"
5289,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,Twitchell is great you will leave her class knowing something different everyday.
5290,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,She is amazing. Hybrid class was the right fit for me. Easy A. Do homework and she will be happy.
5291,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"My Gosh professor Twitchell is hilarious, she very straight forward but super cool. She lets you know from day 1 what to expect and if you dont come to class you will not pass. I enjoyed lectures especially because she would crack a joke every now and then but I mostly Ive learned so much that I did not know pertaining to History."
5292,859417,Charlz,Twitchell,Lone Star College (all),History &amp; Political Science,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,I never felt overwhelmed in this class because she always explained topics and assignments clearly. Professor Twitchell kept an open line of communication and was always there to help even with personal problems. Do the assignments with detail as they help on exams . Terrific class!!
5294,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,2.0,Dr. Curry's lecture videos used real life examples therefore making the material easier to understand. The assignments that were assigned would incorporate the material that you were learning but would make you think outside the box. This class definitely exceeded my expectations especially during this whole COVID situation.
5295,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,2.0,Very clear and organized work! The syllabus was very accurate and contained all the work. Dr. Curry is very respectful and understanding. Overall his class was a very good experience. Easily one of the best professors I've had to date!
5296,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,2.0,Dr. Curry is such a great professor and far from boring. He cares about teaching and the students. I sincerely enjoyed the class since I found the material interesting and engaging. I enjoyed doing the reflection assignments. The amount of homework he assigns is not overwhelming and manageable. Take his class!
5297,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,2.0,"One of the best out there! He keeps the class fun and interesting, even if it's an online course! The online textbook is easy to use, it highlights what you need to know for the quizzes which is helpful. 45 min video lectures once a week and a 1 1/2 page reflection to go along. Grades come back quickly and he leaves great feedback."
5298,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,2.0,I was a bit hesitant on taking an online speech class but this has been one of my favorite classes! I am extremely shy but Dr. Curry made me feel extremely comfortable in this speech class. He has one lecture every week and two to four assignments all due by the end of the week.
5299,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,Dr. Curry gives one lecture a week and usually gives 1 to assignments based on the lecture. He gives great feedback and he is always available he responds to emails usually within the hour. There are no test but he doesnt not take late assignments. I highly recommend taking this class.
5300,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Curry is an excellent professor and has really structured this public communication class in a very organized way in able for us to understand virtually, especially during hard times like these. I would recommend him to any student who is interested in taking a speech class or anything having to do with communications."
5301,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,2.0,was very hesitant on taking this class being solely online but Dr. C made this experience completely possible. Covid has pushed everyone in the direction of online courses but Dr. C is one of the best professors I have ever had even if it was strictly through online.
5302,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"During these tough pandemic times and as well as having to take the class as an online course has always given me such anxiety. However, Professor Curry has really made the course simple and easy. Just put in the effort as you should, and then you will be fine. I enjoyed taking this class and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING HIS CLASS!!!!YOUWILLNOTREGRET!"
5303,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"PROFESSOR DR. CURRY IS AN AWESOME INSTRUCTOR. HIS LECTURES ARE ORGANIZED AND SIMPLE. IF YOU DO THE WORK IT WILL BE AN EASY ""A"". TAKE HIM YOU WONT REGRET HIM AT ALL."
5304,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"Amazing teacher, engaging with the students and always available for help, weekly reflections but they aren't hard to do."
5305,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,2.0,He is good at lectures and the reflections help you learn about the material.
5306,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,3.0,I took Prof Curry for an 8 week online SPCH 1321. He has clear grading criteria and his video lecture were very informative. There are some essays but everything is explanied so well it becomes easier and he gives very good feedback as well. Other than that the homework is simple to do. Overall he is a great professor.
5307,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,3.0,"Professor curry was a great instructor as I took this class online. Being in these tough times I had no choice but to do online and Im glad I chose professor curry. Easy navigation course, clear grading criteria, and easy work. Was skeptical about taking an 8 week but it was worth it. Just do all your work!"
5308,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,1.0,"Dr Curry puts effort into his work, and it showed in all his video lectures. I took the online 8-week class and everything was smooth and simple. A couple papers to write but nothing heavy, do your work and earn an easy A."
5309,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Curry is a great professor! He follows the syllabus, grades work in a timely manner, gives great feedback, and also allows for extra credit. Took his 8-week mini mester online and I would definitely recommend him for anyone taking speech."
5310,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,1.0,"I have taken Prof Curry for his SPCH 1311 &amp; 1321 courses. Both have the exact same layout with different content. I took 1311 as a requirement, but 1321 was simply because I enjoyed the way he taught. There's no final, extra credit, and memes in the lecture vids!! 10/10, would take a third time if I could. Favorite college professor so far!"
5311,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"Great professor, the class is not heavy at all. Very easy to contact for any information or help, lectures were very interesting and funny at times with the clips he would add (one was from The Office). We did have to record 2 videos which I was very nervous about but actually really enjoyed seeing the rest of my classmates."
5312,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1321,5.0,1.0,"Take his class SPCH 1321 this fall. His class is well organized and not really difficult. A 8 week course is pretty relaxed, which does not require to spend really much of time on the weekly assignment."
5313,2425272,Richard,Curry,Lone Star College (all),Communications,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"I am currently taking this class online for this Fall 2020 term, and the professor posts amazing and engaging lecture videos and is caring about his students. It is an awesome class, I highly recommend taking this professor."
5315,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Platon for GEOL 1403 as my last credit of science. Amazing! Scavenger Hunts and Field Trips were really cool, and as long as you go over the stuff on the textbook, labs should not be that difficult. What a nice class for my last semester at LSC!"
5316,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,3.0,4 pages of notes and sketches per chapter.(super easy dont be scared.) 1 page documentary summaries each week.(also easy) 2 tests. Self guided field trips to HMNS and NASA they were really fun Im glad I went. Also a hiking trip and kayaking trip but the kayaking was cancelled due to COVID. Offers things to make up for work missed.
5317,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1405,5.0,2.0,This is my second time taking a class with this professor. Overall if you do the work you will pass. A very caring professor will work with you to help you succeed.
5318,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,2.0,"Lots of note taking on each chapter in the book, easy grade though since its for your own studying. Field trips are fun, better than the alternate assignment. 2 tests for the whole semester, 6 labs, and many documentaries to Youtube and write a paper. Overall, do the work, get a good grade."
5319,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,3.0,2.0,"Although it's an online class, he does assign field trips. If you can't make it, he will provide replacement assignments. Communication is key, the sooner you ask, the sooner he'll get back to you. Otherwise, you may not get a timely response. Overall, I did actually learn about Geology and did not just do assigned work."
5320,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,4.0,2.0,"Prof. Platon is an instructor who cares more about hands-on learning than book-learning. There was a field trip to Panther Creek, a kayaking trip that was canceled, and self-guided trips to the Space Center and HMNS. There are weekly summaries of video documentaries and notes on chapters. This is a good class to fill a science requirement."
5321,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, engaging field trips, and intriguing work!"
5322,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,4.0,Professor Constantin really cares about the success of his students. He is very flexible if you are having trouble. Theres a lot of busy work but its not too hard.
5323,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,2.0,Professor Platon is such a fun professor! He really cares about his students and his subject. He creates a comfortable environment by cracking jokes and getting students to participate in hands on activities and he responds to emails really quick! Would highly recommend this course with him!
5324,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,1.0,Professor C was awesome! He is great at communication and very helpful if you have any questions. We went on fun field trips as well as scavenger hunts. He wants you to learn and be as excited as he is! 10/10 recommend!
5325,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,4.0,3.0,A lot of work. Nothing is online. He is considerate though and a very sweet man.
5326,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOO1403,5.0,2.0,"I took this class as part of my bachelors degree plan. Professor Platon was super cool, I really enjoyed the fact that even with the pandemic going on he made it possible to still have our interactive Lab experience with 2 guided field trips(hiking &amp; kayaking) and 2 self guided field trips(HMNS &amp; NASA) I plan to take the other Geol class he teaches"
5327,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,1.0,"If you have the chance to take him ABSOLUTELY DO. Just keep up on your homework! Its not hard but it will be alot if you haven't kept up. Super flexible, will work with you, wants you to succeed. And has a really cool accent! Also we got to go kayaking, hiking, and on feild trips to museums."
5328,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,1.0,"Easiest Geology class ever. You can pretty much BS everything and still get an A. You don't need to read the textbook. Use large font for the notes and documentaries. Some of the labs can be a little tricky, but they're not terrible. Test 1 was a breeze, the answers were all online. Test 2 was a lot harder since it wasn't MC but not impossible."
5329,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,4.0,"I highly recommend Professor Constantin. He is very organized and gives clear instructions on assignments and grading system. My class was a 6-week summer course so a lot of material was covered per week. He does give the opportunity to catch up if you fall behind but of course, that will depend of the assignment you are behind on."
5330,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,2.0,Professor Constatin is very enthusiastic about teaching geology. He gives great feed back and is easy to reach put to when lost on assignments.
5331,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,4.0,3.0,"The assignment are fairly easy, although there is a lot of work to do. Class is very time consuming. He also requires us to take 4 field trips that are major grades. A lot of them are very far and costly. Other then that he is a nice guy and grades very easily."
5332,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,3.0,4.0,The class in general was easy. The class was converted to fully online because of COVID-19. I would not recommend taking his class online because some of the lessons are not easily understood without being in person. I would stay on top of his class because it goes by fast (at least during the summer). The last 2 lessons were difficult for me!
5333,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,2.0,"Love this professor! Took him for GEOL 1403 online during the summer and it was great. There's field trips that you can go on and they're pretty fun! Easy grader, a lot of busy work but it's easy. You have to really try to fail this class, easy A! Textbook is required but you can find a pdf online or rent it from amazon. follows syllabus"
5334,2137153,Constantin,Platon,Lone Star College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,1.0,"Constantin is a great professor! He really cares about his students' success. The field trips were fun, and he does his best to be accommodate everyone. This class is hard to fail! You really just need to do the work he gives, which isn't difficult bad."
5335,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,3.0,I like this guy.
5336,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,3.0,Works with you so you can do your best.
5337,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,3.0,"It was a summer term, but it was a good class."
5338,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,3.0,"I benefited from the hands-on labs when the concepts were difficult, but I also appreciated being free to do my work at mostly my own pace. He gives lectures when we need it, but we still hold a level of independence when doing classwork, which is great because everyone can go at their own pace."
5339,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,Easy A and very relaxed.
5340,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.5,2.0,He gives clear and accurate instructions. There's a lot of assignments but their not difficult. Pretty straightforward class. Just do the work and you're golden
5341,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.5,1.0,"Really Great Guy, Good Teacher, Computer Class This Class was a Breeze Prof. Brown Is A Guy Who Will Thoroughly Explain in Detail what has to be done for Assignments most Assignments Are Done Through Microsoft Office or Discussion Posts."
5342,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COS1401,4.5,2.0,"Lot's of work but the only part of the class that poses a lot of difficulty is learning Access, but that's because Access is a mess. Learned a lot of really helpful tools pretty easily and the tests are literally straight from the quizzes."
5343,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COS1401,3.5,2.0,The grades are graded by an online grading system. Adrian helps but if he can't figure it out you're out of luck. It's a lot of little projects but if you finish them and keep up you'll do okay. The grading is harsh because it is done by a system.
5344,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Brown is very laid-back and very informative. You will have multiple discussion posts to do, but they are very easy and do-able. The tests are STRAIGHT FROM THE QUIZZES, and the answers are easy to memorize (EASY A'S!). The ""projects"" are very easy and you will have three chances to make a 100 on them."
5345,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,The class was easy since the Professor  made every assignment clear and easy to understand.
5346,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,2.0,this class is awesome you really learn alot about Microsoft and what it has to offer.
5347,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.5,2.0,"He is a really great guy. If you ask questions he is more than willing to help you out and help work through whatever problem you many have, textbook is a must and you will have a computer project almost every week but it is very manageable if you know how to use the Microsoft Office Suite. Overall great class must take."
5348,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC2441,4.0,2.0,"Good Professor. Show up, do the work and pass."
5349,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,2.5,4.0,it okay
5350,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,1.0,"Great teacher. If you show up to class and do your work, it is an easy grade."
5351,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,3.0,4.0,There was a ton of homework.
5352,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,2.5,2.0,The books are a must for this class. Be sure to do the textbook projects exactly as the book tells you. Tutoring is a good way to get help if you are not understanding the projects. Be sure to stay ahead on your work because it can pile up quickly if you do not stay on top of it.
5353,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,Make sure you read the online modules to do the projects and quizzes. Do that and it'll make the semester go by so much faster and easier.  Real cool guy. Don't be afraid to ask questions; the only stupid question is the one you don't ask.
5354,1598391,Adrian,Brown,Lone Star College (all),Computer Information Tech.,COSC1301,4.0,1.0,"Grades tough, but all fair. He gives extra credit opportunity at the end of the school year when you've missed some assignments in his class. Lenient and helps when we ask for it. Very thorough with his work and does a practice assignment before we do the actual one. "
5356,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,1.0,"Sawyerr was really tough in the 1st week of my 6-week summer class, but we talked things over and she was one of the best profs. A little outgoing- lots of class participation. also- say good morning/afternoon- she loves that. I got a high A on every project- just follow the rubric &amp; work hard and you will be fine."
5357,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,1.0,She went out of the way to help me succeed
5358,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2317,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sawyerr is an excellent teacher. I personal never cared for math and always saw it as my weakest point, but thanks to her! I no longer am afraid of doing the work. She really cares and wants the best for her students. However, make sure to attend class and do your work. Participation does matter! Lastly, I recommend her class definitely."
5359,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,GENPSYCH2301,1.0,4.0,Condescending and not good with communication.
5360,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,4.0,"This class was a class I orignally hated cause of all the work, and sometimes even sass from the professor. But by the end of it I loved the class and I was so glad I was pushed at times and called out for being lazy and being able to do better cause this is college. Honestly one of my favorite classes and crazy that it was from lonestar lol."
5361,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PHSY1301,1.0,4.0,Do not take her!! She will give you an attitude if you do not greet her as soon as you walk in and makes you get out and walk back in to do it... ridiculous! She treats you as a child and does not respect you as an adult. NEVER grades on time.
5362,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC4390,1.0,4.0,"Hand's down the worst professor I have ever taken. As an A student, I have never had to deal with a more unprofessional and rude professor in my life! Her emails/announcements always have syntax errors (though she takes points off if YOU do, hypocrite), &amp; she catches attitude even through an email. I'm beyond happy I never have to take her again."
5363,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,3.0,1.0,"Be sure to attend class especially for Presentation days and when she tells you to do a specific assignment be sure to do it. Take advantage of all the extra credit opportunities. Be sure to keep up with the syllabus, be sure to always read the power points before class and be prepared to discuss or participate everyday. Her tests are online."
5364,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PHSYC2301,1.0,4.0,"She makes you feel as uncomfortable as possible. Incredibly rude attitude and makes you feel uneasy asking questions during class, and lord forbid if the question you asked her is on the syllabus. And as another person mentioned, she humiliates students in class and tries to psychoanalyze every small thing making it impossible to have an opinion."
5365,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PHSYC2301,1.0,4.0,"Very rude. You would think that you will finally be treated as an adult in college, well not with her. I get that she's older but she does not have to humiliate students in front of the class. She will look at students dumb if they don't have a psychological answer when it could be just your opinion! Wait till next semester instead of taking her."
5366,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,4.0,Dr. Sawyerr is the BEST! Her lectures are very interesting and she is hilarious! I love her personality! Take her! Exams and homework is ONLINE! it is the best!!
5367,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,3.0,"I took her class fully online over the summer. All her work is on Connect, she literally did not teach anything. A lot of easy assignments on there, plus an APA format essay every week. She doesn't accept late work unless you run it by her first. But if you do the work on time, youll pass."
5368,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2301,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Sawyerr's online psych was so much better compared to the large lecture hall experience I had the first time I took this course. She was very empathetic when I made an error, and really wants to see her students do well in the class! She give you plenty of chances for extra credit if you need it."
5369,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PHSYC2301,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Sawyerr wasn't a very effective teacher. All tests &amp; quizzes are online &amp; open note/partner/google. There was a simple group project &amp; a couple essays. All easy work, however I don't feel as if this class was beneficial b/c everything was ""open book"" Didn't take notes? No prob. She didn't really teach, just read the PP, that you can download."
5370,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PHSY1301,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Sawyerr is an amazing professor, she is very fair, communication is key when you need help. She puts effort into her syllabus, everything you need to know is located there. She is passionate about her courses which makes it easy and fun to learn the material. Do your work and participate and you'll get an A"
5371,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PHSY1301,4.0,3.0,"Dr. Sawyerrs class is solid! Her attitude is what makes the class fun, it was one of my favorite classes in a past semester. The work is not too hard, just take notes and listen to the lectures."
5372,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PHSY1301,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Sawyer is my favorite professor, not only was it because of her personality but the way she made me feel welcomed. Her lectures are super fun and she's straight up with everything. TOTALLY recommend her!!!"
5373,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,Dr. sawyer is awesome! she has super interesting lectures and is super outgoing as well as funny. she likes to joke around as if she was one of our peers (which actually made the class more fun) so dont take anything to heart. she cares a lot about her students so if you have a good reason for whatever she will be more than happy to accommodate.
5374,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC23016008,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Sawyerrs class is very intense from the start. However, she lists every single assignment in the syllabus at the beginning. By doing so, we are given the responsibility of balancing workload. She uses a great techinique to challenge us on the skills we need to prepare in the real world workforce. She is very knowledgeable and makes class fun"
5375,1778989,Cherry,Sawyerr,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"Without a doubt one of the best professors I've ever had. She gives you every chance she can to give you an A, hands out extra credit almost every class, and follows the syllabus almost exactly. She has a crude sense of humor, so just know how to take a joke. I wish she taught more of the classes I need!"
5377,1323269,Amy,Varon,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,4.0,4.0,"Great and funny teacher, but study about a week before all of her tests and quizzes. Also, during presentations, don't look down! She will take off about 10 points every time you do so."
5378,1323269,Amy,Varon,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,1.0,1.0,Don't take her.
5379,1323269,Amy,Varon,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1301,5.0,1.0,Professor Varon was without a doubt my favorite professor from LSC and is without a doubt a funny and caring person.

5398,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1301,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ethredge was really wonderful! I took her during the Spring semester for in person learning. On the first day of class, she was very intimidating, and I thought I had made the wrong choice. But I couldn't be more wrong! She was a wonderful professor who provided great feedback and really expanded my knowledge."
5399,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,4.0,4.0,"Professor Ethredge is a pretty tough professor and grader, she is straightforward and will tell you exactly how it is even if it is harsh, putting that aside I think there is a lot to benefit from this class for the future. She uses Canvas instead of D2L. This class will be hard but put in the work, and your writing will improve for sure."
5400,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,4.0,RUN AWAY. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She harasses students to make them feel dumb in front of their fellow peers and gets off on it. This professor is narcissistic and shouldn't be teaching. People drop out of her class like flies because of her attitude. STAY AWAY.
5401,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,5.0,4.0,"I was really scared on the 1st day because Professor Ethredge had intimidating, strict vibes straight off the bat. Although those things prove true, she is one of the best mentors I ever had. There is a lot of work, but if you read outside of class, take notes, and pay attention in class, you will be able to come out as a better person and student."
5402,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,5.0,4.0,"This ENGL 2323 class is the one you intend to blow through, but realize now that you will not. Professor Ethredge is a person who will tell you as it is. You get 100% of what you see. In this survey class, you will leave enlightened and ambitious as to your next chapter. Professor Ethredge asks vivifying questions that you will not find elsewhere."
5403,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,5.0,5.0,"First day of class, I was very scared. There was so much work, and the expectations were super high. After getting to know her and her teaching style, I realized that she is one of the best. Everything in the class is for a purpose, and it is very easy to relate to. I use to hate reading and writing, but with her, I look forward to it. RECOMMEND!"
5404,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,5.0,4.0,"In the beginning of the semester, I knew she was going to be strict and straight forward by the way she introduced herself. Honestly, I did not think I was going to make through the course. She really helped my writing skills, as well as my critical thinking skills, and overall helped me improve as a student. I highly recommend her class."
5405,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,5.0,4.0,"This class is the best class I've ever taken. If you think high school wasn't challenging, you're probably right because Prof. Ethredge carries your level of thinking to the next. Her lessons don't just benefit NOW, but your future as well. You may hate poems now, but that's before you take her class. Thank you, Prof. Ethredge."
5406,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,4.0,5.0,"This class, though intimidating at first, may be one of the best classes you can take here at Lonestar University Park. This class will take you through an entirely new enlightening period, this is truly a study of man. The assignments are not difficult and you have plenty of time to revise your essay as well."
5407,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,4.0,4.0,"She's a very good teacher, would recommend."
5408,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,4.0,4.0,Probably the best English teacher I have ever had. The lectures connected literature to modern times and personal experiences. I can truly say I grew as a person after taking this class.
5409,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL2323,5.0,4.0,She is an excellent teacher that gives an insane new perspective and teaching style that I have never experienced before. After taking her class I have a whole new way of viewing not only literature but the world we live in.
5410,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"You will not regret taking this class. It will open your mind to interpreting the world and different perspectives people take on life. Although challenging, it will be an experience worth taking ."
5411,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,5.0,"Mrs. Ethredge is a terrific professor. I am a dual credit student but she gives me the respect and accountability of an adult. She never fails to blow our minds with new perspectives on thinking. If you are looking for an easy class move find a different professor. However, if you are looking to be challenged and to truly learn than she is for you."
5412,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ethredge is a very patient person and she is one to not give up. She will make you think about everything until you are sure about your option. By the end of the course, you will be a better writer. She is very specific for every assignment as well as in feedback."
5413,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"The course itself is not difficult but the new level of thinking is. You will be stressed when writing these papers, I strongly recommend you do not do them last minute. She is very encouraging when it comes to our writing, my skills have even improved significantly. I'm glad I had her as my professor."
5414,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,"Although the class was difficult, I can walk out of the class knowing I have earned my A. She is inspirational, extraordinary, and good at advice if you need it. A piece of advice would be to not let your work pile up!"
5415,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,Professor Ethredge requires students to complete their work to the best of their ability.
5416,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,4.0,The professor is really supportive and always accessible for anything we need. She made us see a different perspective of things and blew our minds in the process.
5417,1716444,Elizabeth,Ethredge,Lone Star College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Ethredge gives good feedback within each assignment we do for her and makes us see the mistakes we have made. We also do discussions to get the class participating to see different viewpoints. Also, Professor Ethredge explains each assignment to a level we understand."
5419,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"Professor R. Chris Davis is the best professor I ever had. He also provides a textbook online. His quizzes and all assignments are super easy. Take Chris Davis, you won't regret it! I would definitely take him again if I could."
5420,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"I took this class as a 6 week summer session. This class is solely based on points so the more assignments you do, the higher your grade is, it never goes down. There are 3 assignment choices per week (discussion post, writing response based on book &amp; multiple choice quiz on textbook chapters). SO easy!! Take Chris Davis, you won't regret it!!!"
5421,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Davis was awesome! Because he grades using a point system, you essentially get to choose what your final grade will be. All of the books we used could be found online free of charge. He gives great feedback and you really learn a lot while taking his class. I would definitely take him again if I could."
5422,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"hist 1301 was incredible with prof davis, he gives great feedback focusing on how to do better and the tests are based on the reviews he provides. Never had any trouble, learned a lot and gave me a lot of confidence. I will be taking him for hist 1302. IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE, CHOOSE THIS PROFESSOR!!"
5423,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,Hands down the best professor I have yet to have. I had him as an online class and all assingments are easy! His quizes are super easy and discussions are a piece of cake if you just follow directions. Would definetly recommend him!!! Very understanding and gives lots of extra points to pass his class.
5424,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,Took him during Summer 2020 for Hist 1302 6 weeks online and the course is pretty easy. The grading scale he uses lets the student determine their final grade. If you're lazy you won't pass but if you put in the effort to do the assignments it's an easy A and you will learn a great deal about culture and history. All of the textbooks are free!!!
5425,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"I took his class through the COVID week and he made the change (to in face to online) manageable. He is a wonderful teacher that makes you learn history even if you hate history. It takes you to 5-6 chapters filled with homework and test. Has a unique grading criteria but I recommend you do all the work to get a good grade, the class is flexible."
5426,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,I just took his class and loved it. I've always enjoyed history and even with the class being online I feel like he made the experience an open and honest one that anyone can learn from and comprehend. Assignments are organized and criteria is easy to understand. Gives clear and specific feedback. Make sure you read the books and cite your sources.
5427,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"This was the easy class that I actually enjoyed. Professor Davis has a grading point system, which was really great. He also provides a textbook online, which is helpful for the assignments. Davis also provides assignments for a novel that you have to read. It was a great novel. Overall, this was a class I enjoyed and I recommend this professor."
5428,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"He was the easiest HIST 1302, it is more about doing some of the assignments. It is a point system based, the videos and lectures help a lot, and you don't need to buy the book he provides it for you. A bit of a lot of reading, depending what assignments you decide to do, but nothing that is too heavy that you won't pass. Definitely take him!"
5429,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed this class and the structure of the course. We had the option to complete whichever assignments we wanted to for each unit, just as long as we made sure that we would earn enough points by the end of the semester. You are told how many points each assignment is worth. We read a lot and I learned a lot. Amazing professor."
5430,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"He's amazing! He started each week off with a Kahoot! in order to test our knowledge and not bore us. If you try, you can easily make an A! I really wish I could have ended the year in-person, but that's not his fault. Overall one of my favorite professors."
5431,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Highly recommend! Took his class Spring 2020, switched online bc of covid-19, but he still made the transition smooth. Assignments are pick and choose, reading? yes. I skimmed through most of it and still got an A in the class. Not hard at all, if you failed, its bc you didn't do the work."
5432,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"You can choose the assignments you want to do. Each assignment has a number of points. You can choose your grade. BUT all you do for this class is read. Read the textbook and take the test. No video lectures, powerpoints, or inquizitive."
5433,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"LITERALLY THE BEST PROFESSOR. i am not good or interested in history but i loved this class. He gives you 4-5 assignments for every two weeks. They're not mandatory but the more you do the more points you receive which means the higher grade you get. Each unit there is a quiz, book quiz (super easy), discussion, and a document analysis. TAKE HIM!"
5434,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HISTH1302,5.0,2.0,"I love Professor Davis!! Amazing lectures for sure! I was always into it, and I was always focused.

Prof's grading scale allows you to earn an A without doing every assignment, but you must put in the work! Lots of reading. You can tell he loves this subject! Earn an 80+ on any assignment and he gives you full credit. Great reading materials, videos, etc. I really learned so much and will take his HIST 1302 for sure!"
5436,2062872,R. Chris,Davis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Davis has been the best teacher I have ever taken. He gives you the chance to pick what grade you get in the class. You can do however many assignments you want per unit, the more you do the more points you get. Very hard to not get an A in this class. Great story teller, lots of movies in class, keeps it interesting. free textbook online"

5442,497441,Kevin,Sumrall,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2314,5.0,1.0,Prof. Sumrall is one of the best. You have to read his PowerPoint note thoroughly before taking the quizzes. Only two discussions worth 25points each and textbook is needed. Remember you have to read his PowerPoint and textbook in order to pass the quizzes. Take him.
5443,497441,Kevin,Sumrall,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2314,5.0,1.0,Took the summer class and it was super easy. Only 2 discussions for the whole class and about 3 quizzes a week. Quizzes can only be completed once and under 20 minutes but it's really not that bad. Get the PDF book with Kindle so you can search and have your PP presentations ready. Do your self a favor and take him as your professor.
5444,497441,Kevin,Sumrall,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2306,5.0,2.0,"Easy A, I took this class with microbiology, and I was done with class by march of spring break. it was 100% online, and opened so I was able to be and stay ahead.

5461,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUS1306,5.0,3.0,"I had a great time taking Prof. Salstrom's class. She made online covid classes incredibly structured, I had no issues following the schedule. The class was a light load but you still need to figure out music elements that aren't easy for everyone to understand, including myself."
5462,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSI1306,4.0,2.0,"Salstrom is a pretty good professor but a bit hard to reach. She will respond to emails, but you may need to email her more than once. There are a few tests and concert reviews as well as discussions but they isn't a lot. She is not a tough grader and gives lots of extra credit. If you just complete the assignments, you can easily pass with an A."
5463,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSI1306,1.0,4.0,This professor is difficult for no reason. Most professor make it clear what work is due and when. Piles course info in one place and you have to go searching for work. There are no clear deadlines on assignments. Be ready to read as she's piles multiple assignments in a 1 week time span. Very vane and speaks in 3rd person. More work than biology
5464,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSI1307,5.0,2.0,"She clearly lays out expectations. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. Lots of reading (6week course). Quizzes are easy. If you do the work, and participate, its an easy A"

The assignments are super easy and the quizzes and exams are open book making it nearly impossible to fail. She responded quickly to my emails and was so sweet when she did. She really lets you have total freedom in the papers and lets you kind of take control within reason which was great.
5467,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSI1310,4.0,3.0,"Professor Salstrom offers lots of extra credit and her class is fairly easy. Make sure to keep up to date with discussions and essays, because they're a big part of your grade."
5468,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor is a great. If you keep up with the syllabus it will be an easy class. If you delay and procrastinate it will be much more difficult as she does not accept any late work. Get ready for weekly quizzes, three exams and two papers. If you enjoy music, you won't have any problems."
5469,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1310,4.0,3.0,"I took Prof. Salstrom as a 6 week Summer course. She is very kind and helpful and wants to see her students succeed. There were 12 chapter quizzes (which you could take over until you got the grade you wanted), and 3 exams. There were also 5 discussions. The discussions are worth A LOT of your grade. Sometimes more than exams and major projects."
5470,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1310,4.0,1.0,She is a good teacher by far is the class hard. You do the work you get the grade simple. I would take her again hands down.
5471,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1310,5.0,4.0,"Professor Salstrom cares about her students, as long as you follow the schedule and do your work on time youll pass."
5472,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1310,5.0,1.0,Just follow the syllabus and you'll pass with an A.
5473,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUS1306,5.0,2.0,"Salstrom makes this course HARD TO FAIL!!! do your work, turn it in on time and you'll be just fine! She strives to see all her students pass! I loved having a semester with her!"
5474,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1306,5.0,2.0,"I took this course online during the pandemic so there was a lot of work to catch up on. The class got cut down to 6 week term but she was very well organized and always available to answer question in a timely manner. I took this class only for my art credit, but if I were a music major I would definitely take her for music courses."
5475,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1310,5.0,3.0,"The class is pretty easy and straight-forward. She follows the syllabus exactly. There's a quiz every chapter with unlimited attempts. An exam every 3-4 chapters but the questions come from the quizzes, so they're pretty easy to pass. There are 3 papers to write; a listening assignment, and 2 concert reviews. She also provides extra credit."
5476,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1310,5.0,3.0,"I faltered a bit my semester with her but she reached out to me personally and gave me a list of everything upcoming I needed to do and a couple previous missed assignments I could make up. Based on her syllabus, this is not the norm. she was extremely helpful and understanding during COVID-19 you can tell she puts a lot of effort into this class."
5477,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUSIC1306,5.0,3.0,"There are plenty of opportunities for extra credit. You must read and take the quizzes. The papers are only two pages, but that's long if you don't know what you're talking about. Overall, you learn a ton, and she's very willing to help."
5478,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUS1306,5.0,2.0,"Honestly I was expecting the course to be hard because I'm lazy, but it really wasn't. Very organized and straight forward. Has some inquizitives due by the end of every week, some discussions, a couple of concert reviews, and a few tests. She also has a lot of extra credit available which don't take much time to do."
5479,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUS1306,5.0,3.0,"clear grading criteria ,begginer course, TONS of extra credit available"
5480,944298,Sandra,Salstrom,Lone Star College (all),Music,MUS1306,4.0,4.0,"Class was difficult especially being that it was music, so your learning a lot about a lot. Very will organized. Would recommended professor. Extra credit opportunities"
5482,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,PHY2426,1.0,1.0,I took online phys 2. He didn't post any videos of him lecturing or an other material other than scans of the textbook. Also he made an error in my grade and did not want to rectify it. I had to get admin and deans involved to solve the matter.
5483,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,PHY2426,1.0,1.0,This proff knows nothing of phys 2 and has zero involvement in the course. All he did was post screenshots of the textbook no lectures or zoom meetings. He was impossible to reach thru email or phone. the class is easy though.
5484,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,1.0,5.0,"Mr. Patel speaks so softly that unless you're in the front row, you cannot hear him. he is merciless when it comes to interrupting his class for even asking questions, even going as far as to angrily exclaim to a student ""what about this do you not understand?!"". this is only the beginning, I don't have enough letters, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS AT ALL."
5485,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,2.0,4.0,Do not take his early class. He is non-energetic and carless with his teaching. My 9am class was the worst due to his quiet voice and lack of knowledge with the problems he would work out. Would recommend not taking him.
5486,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,3.0,He makes it very clear at the beginning of the semester that you have to try and work hard to pass or do good. He cares about your grades and wants everyone to pass. He is a good teacher and he will be very helpful if you see him in the math center. The class is a little difficult because of the homework and you have to practice what you learned.
5487,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,3.0,4.0,"Professor Patel takes math seriously. If you put in the work and give him your best then you will get a good grade, but if you miss class or don't study it will be a rough class. Overall he is a good teacher who knows the material well and expects you to work your hardest."
5488,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,3.0,Professor Patel really cares about your grade if you are willing to actually try and work for it. Their is a lot of homework but he gives you plenty of time to finish them. Their will be a lot of quizzes but they are not hard and can be done easily If you just kinda understand the subject.
5489,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,4.0,"Professor Patel is a very good teacher. He will help you work problems out and does not want to see any of his students fail. He has you do a lot of practice problems but they help you be prepared for the review and test. DO NOT skip class, even though he posts his notes online he goes over a lot of material in class that you don't want to miss."
5490,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,4.0,"Although he is a good teacher, it may take a while to get used to his teaching style. If you don't show up to class, you will miss a lot of the material."
5491,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,4.0,He is a very fast grader! He is kind and gives good extra credit so Id take advantage. The course itself is tough and I wouldnt recommend missing class because he gives out quizzes that are for a grade and cant be made up. Cares highly for his students and their grades.
5492,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,4.0,"Honestly hes a great professor, you just need to put in the effort and youll do well. Calculus isnt easy for everyone but he takes the time to make sure you understand the material."
5493,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,3.0,"This professor lectures a lot, but if you put in the work, you will pass his class."
5494,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,3.0,He grades hard but for the most it's fair.
5495,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,4.0,"He goes above and beyond for his students and genuinely cares. If you're really bad at math like I am he gives you a fighting chance to earn credit for the class. There are daily quizzes that you can work with others to make sure you learned the material for the day, homework, and exams. I have really bad math anxiety and I mad it through thisclass"
5496,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,4.0,4.0,"He is a very nice teacher, the two and a half hour class is not it though."
5497,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,3.0,Professor Patel is a good teacher that genuinely wants you to succeed. The lecture notes are all online and great to follow along with as you listen to his lecture. Study the review and assignments to study for the test.
5498,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2413,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Patel is a soft spoken, caring teacher who gives good lectures that are easy to understand despite his accent. There are quizzes in class fairly but we can work with each other and use notes. The homework assigned is in bulk with a far off due date. If one is done after each lecture it should be no problem to keep up. Extra credit for reviews."
5499,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2412,1.0,5.0,"He has no respect for other students. He will show you his hand and tell you ""This is how we do in India."" He uses excessive force on students and lightly smacks you on the shoulder if you don't understand a problem with anger NOT jokingly. He's very discouraging to other students and will put you down if you're having a hard time solving a problem"
5500,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,PHY2426,1.0,4.0,"He is the rudest professor I have every had! If I got a question wrong on a quiz, he was extremely rude about it and would not help me find my mistakes. He calls out students during the lecture for no reason. When giving back exams, he will criticizes you for the grade you made. Lectures are not worth going to because he confuses you more. AVOID!!"
5501,626418,Vaheribhai,Patel,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,4.0,3.0,"Hes a prof that will give you the benefit of the doubt If he sees youre trying . The homework is a lot, but the math center is EXTREMELY useful. Dont go in unprepared. Dont think if you missed a day you can come back with an excuse for making up missed assignments he wont allow it. Try and youll pass"
5503,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,HIST1302,3.0,5.0,"Took a 4 week online. Theres a 4-8 page essay due EVERY week. Also 2 mandatory response topics &amp; 5 student choice response topics that you have to work on while also writing the essays. If you have a job/full course load, do not take him. VERY disorganized D2L format, hard to navigate. Answers emails quickly and seems nice, but wouldnt recommend."
5504,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"Great course and Professor. I found everything to be easy to follow and Prof. Birch limited chapters of book so no ""fluff"" reading required. Excellent video lectures. Everything you need is in the lectures, handouts, and syllabus. Flexible office hours. Follow the template/send him your drafts  A+ no HW just essays. not hard if paying attention"
5505,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2305,1.0,4.0,"Birch gives a heavy amount of writing assignments for a survey course; but the thing that gets me the most is how quite he is. The speakers on my computer arent enough to hear him, I have to use headpones on full blast just to understand him this is made more difficult given that his class is lecture dependent."
5506,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"Professor Birch was my first college professor and he was GREAT!! Outside of class we had readings, and were only graded on papers (5 total). Just take notes, participate verbally during (very engaging + funny) lectures, read and cite the textbook, prove you understand, and he's a happy professor. 10/10 would recommend. We love Professor Birch. &lt;3"
5507,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,3.0,Professor Burch does an amazing job at explaining difficult concepts within government. His grading comes from essays so make sure to understand the material enough to write about it. He is very involved and his primary interest is to make sure the students understand the concept.
5508,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"For someone who doesn't care for and has a hard time with government, I got a lot out of this class. Great professor!"
5509,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2301,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, wonderful person, and very intelligent. Easy to follow his course as long as you pay attention to his interesting lectures."
5510,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,Professor Birch is a great professor. No tests and no quizzes. There are papers but he provides an outline of what the paper should be about. I would definitely recommend.
5511,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"Yes, you have some papers to write but he gives you an exact outline of what he wants you to write about, and does many video lectures basically writing the paper for you. No test, no quizzes. I would definitely take this class again. He is seriously the best teacher! Very caring, and responds quickly. By far one of my favorite teachers! Trust me!"
5512,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,1.0,3.0,"This teacher seemed really easy, however, I ended up dropping his class because it was SO confusing. There were 30+ assignments to read on top of the chapters of the book and then you have to write a paper, and it was very confusing to figure what he wanted you to write about and how to get the information when there is so much reading material."
5513,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,4.0,2.0,"Professor Birch is a very good teacher, it's really and easy A with him. The only thing is that he is Liberal and he is PRETTY obvious with it, he won't give you neutral material, he will give you his Liberal material. Also, he makes fun of texans every time he can, so if you're sensitive don't take him. Copy the book and handouts for the essays."
5514,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"If you are more of an auditory learner, then this is the class for you. You will need the textbook because his essays are reflected on it. In the whole semester, we only had four essays and inquisitive to do. If you have any questions don't be afraid to ask him. P.S Beware of his lectures, if you don't participate, the gypsies will come to get you."
5515,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"I loved having Birch as a professor. He's hilarious, sarcastic, and loves participation. Participate and you won't hear jokes every fifteen minutes about the class's silence. I learned things every class. Oh also, he checks these reviews and sometimes mentions them in class. Overall, participate and *follow the template*!!"
5516,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,1.0,"Lets starts off by saying hes pretty funny but also monotone. But idk its good somehow? Second hes a liberal, hates on Chick-fil-A, and makes fun of HEB and Whataburger. So if thats gonna irritate you then too bad. Hes not from Texas and he makes fun of Texans a lot but its funny. Love him one of my best professors yet!"
5517,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2301,2.0,2.0,"I think professor Birch is a good guy but his class got really boring, really quick. I took his class in the fall semseter and after the thanksgiving break i only showed up once and that was to attend the final. His lectures have no clear subject and he wanders often. There's no real focus to them whatsoever."
5518,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,3.0,Great
5519,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2306,5.0,1.0,I LOVED THIS CLASS!!!! Only 4 essays! NO HW OR TEST OR QUIZZES. Very Easy. He outlined most of your essay and all you had to do was copy and paste
5520,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,took a 4 week online class. very clear about what he wanted! posted short lecture videos which were very helpful! 10/10 would recommend!
5521,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOVT2305,3.0,2.0,"Overall he's a good professor. Only a few issues. First, some of his grading criteria for essays is subjective. The only other issue is how heavily biased he is with his political views. It's evident in most of his provided materials and a bit questionable given his position in a political science course."
5522,1406903,David,Birch,Lone Star College (all),Government,GOV2302,3.0,2.0,"He will give you ALL the information you need to pass his class, but he wasn't the professor for me. I missed class &amp; still did fine on the essays. He has a dry wit and wants participation. on't be afraid to ask questions. I don't feel like he taught the material as much as he just gave handouts for you to follow. It's a fail-proof class."
5524,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2412,1.0,4.0,I took this prof bc she had good ratings but this class turned out horrible for me. No other resources except the textbook &amp; the prof isn't helpful. Homework is 60+ questions in one go and you won't receive credit for your test answers without showing CORRECT work on scratch paper. Avoid this prof if you can.
5525,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,5.0,"Hardest class i've took and the first class i ever dropped. Everything is through mymathlab, you have to self teach yourself because she only grades what you turn in. homework is heavy. you have to show all your work on your answers and they all have to be correct to get the points. i wouldn't recommend this teacher."
5526,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,1.0,5.0,DO NOT take this course unless you want to teach yourself via math textbook. Math videos and examples are not even from the teacher herself but from the videos provided by the text book through math lab.
5527,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2412,1.0,4.0,"Like a couple other reviews, there's a lot of homework. I mean a lot, and no video lectures or notes. By far the hardest course I took because you have to self teach. Everything is through math lab and that's also how you'll learn the entire course. She's only there to give you a grade, basically."
5528,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2412,3.0,4.0,"Though I got an A+, it was the HARDEST class I've ever taken. I took her summer PRE-Cal online class, a very heavy hw assignment. For exams, MUST show the CORRECT work for ALL questions to receive credit. No instruction videos/ materials, NOTHING! Just read books, and learn everything on your own. For me, her role in this class is just a GRADER"
5529,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2412,2.0,5.0,"I absolutely dont know how this professed gets so many good ratings. This was the hardest class Ive ever taken! Took her summer minimester, be prepared to stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning morning on homework assignments. Especially if you have a job and are tying to do school at the same time. Did not answer any questions I emailed, very rough"
5530,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,Professor Sampson is amazing! I took her online college algebra class and got an easy A. She records videos of the lessons in which she worked multiple examples and overall are very helpful. All of the homeworks &amp; quizzes over prepare you for the tests. Just take notes and you'll do fine!
5531,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,4.0,3.0,Great videos to show how to work problems . Homework and quizzes are not that difficult and not long at all the exams are at the testing centers but are just like the reviews great class I would definitely recommend her!
5532,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,CAL1325,5.0,2.0,"The easiest math ive ever taken, everything is very clear when it comes to grading and what you need to learn. Super nice professor who is willing to help. If you do the work and study for the few tests (where most of your grade will come from) you should make an A!!!!"
5533,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2412,5.0,3.0,"I took this online over the summer with tests taking at the testing center. She was very helpful when I ran into technical issues the night a quiz was due. If you keep up with the homework and study what's in the book, you will be okay. The online videos were very helpful."
5534,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"If you've been avoiding math like me for years because you struggle with it you MUST take her course, she offers tons of ""extra credit"" meaning you can take the quizzes and do the homework on MML as many times as you want in order to pass which prepares you for the tests which are just like the quizzes and hw you did. TAKE HER IF YOU WANT TO PASS!"
5535,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,"Professor Sampson made college algebra a breeze! She provided all the material via videos through MyMathLab which made learning super easy. Homework and quizzes can be redone as many times necessary, and they are VERY straight forward, same as the tests (which are proctored). Very enjoyable class!! :) She is also easily reached via email."
5536,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,ALG1314,5.0,3.0,"Good professor but I felt like some of the things on homework and tests were not covered by her lectures on MyMathLab, so be sure to read each chapter listed on her outline on the syllabus. Also gives extra credit based off scratch paper during tests which is helpful if math isnt your best subject. Work through reviews multiple times like she says!"
5537,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,ALG1314,5.0,2.0,"I'm glad I took her class because she helps her students via email and in person. I hate Math but, the way she explained it to me was clear, and I aced the finals. If Math is not your strong point take her and don't be afraid to ask for help or assistance. Everything is on MML."
5538,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,"shes the best professor in all of lone star, her class was so easy, and you could literally walk in until she takes attendance and leave. she answers emails quickly, and don't believe anyone that says she's a bad teacher, she was amazing."
5539,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,3.0,"Entire course unlocked 1st day. Unlimited attempts on hw/quizzes, records the highest score. Midterm and Final 75% of grade, study the reviews as that's the exams. Class is self teachable if using the view an example option in the hw. Not able to take notes into testing so repetition is key. Entire course is through Mymathlab w/ a 2 week trial."
5540,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,Amazing professor that added on more understanding to my math skills that I already knew help me to understand every concept if I had questions here and there she was always there to help me the video lectures lessons were online and if you were confused she was always there great personality and I would definitely recommend her.
5541,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH0310,4.0,3.0,Very responsive to emails and took time to help elaborate any questions you may have. I had a little trouble understanding a small portion she took the time to explain it through an email and knew which HW assignment would be useful to revisit.
5542,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"For those autodidacts out there, this is how a self-taught class should be organized. Due dates are clearly expressed, you are given the opportunity to re-work assignments until you understand them, and test closely resembles review. All you have to do is put in the effort to locate the material in the book, take notes, and work the samples."
5543,1166704,Kristina,Sampson,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"I took Professor Sampson for a minimester and she was amazing! Show up to class and individually watch her lecture videos followed by online homework and quizzes. Her grading rubric was very fair, retake as many times as you want except the midterm and final which you can only take once. Her videos were very helpful!"
5545,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"I had Professor Collins for the fall semester of 2020 online. He is well organized and creates the perfect understanding of what you need to learn and what assignments should consist of. The class doesn't feel rushed or have any downfalls in my opinion. I felt as though I was actually educated, I would HIGHLY recommend."
5546,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,Professor Collins did a great job during the pandemic. He was quick to respond and assist with any issues. I took an online summer class and there is a speech due every week but as long as you put in a effort you can succeed. I looked forward to submitting my speech each week and reading responses from my peers and professor.
5547,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"Professor Collins is driven to ensure that his students succeed. He does not leave anyone behind, and makes sure there is always an opportunity to redeem yourself. I had to take this class to transfer to my university, but I truly believe I have grown when it comes to writing and delivering speeches."
5548,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"Professor Collins helped me become a better speaker. You are required to participate in discussion boards, record your speech in-front of people and post it, and respond/ critique your peers speeches. He is very helpful and responds relatively fast! He wants his students to do their best and will do everything he can to make sure they succeed."
5549,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"Professor Collins is truly great!! I am so glad that I took him for speech. Throughout the course, there are 4 speeches and weekly discussion posts which is not bad at all. He gives great feedback and responds to emails fast. I would recommend taking this class if you want to become a better speaker!!! Take him!!"
5550,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"Prof Collins was a true gem! I am so happy to have signed up for his class, I don't think I would've learned this much and still made an A with any other prof. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SIGN HERE IT IS--&gt; TAKE HIM!!! :)"
5551,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,4.0,3.0,"First off, let me say I DO NOT like making speeches at all, but the textbook reading combined with the feedback he gave made giving them bearable. Even though my course was only three weeks and I never met him in person, it is clear Collins has a passion for speeches and teaching students how to present professionally."
5552,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Collins for an online 3 week mini mester and I loved it. We had one speech due each week so it definitely required some work, but Professor Collins is very clear on what he expects and gives great feedback. Even though it was an online class, I could tell that he really cared about his students and wanted us to improve."
5553,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,4.0,Professor Collins is truly caring and wants you to improve on speeches. He will give precise feedback on your speeches to improve and will look for that improvement in your future speeches. Be sure to put effort into it! The class overall has helped me feel more confident about talking in front of others for my future career.
5554,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"I had a blast with this class! I was intimidated because it was a 3 week mini semester, but Professor Collins was a great communicator and he made everything pretty straight forward. As long as you manage your time well, you should do great!"
5555,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,2.0,"Professor Collins was a good teacher who had clear criteria for grading. Not an automatic A, but if you put in the effort and follow his clear instructions you can get the grade you want. He made the work interesting and it never dragged on; take him, you will not regret it!"
5556,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"I honestly have really enjoyed this class, But of course you have to put in the work to get the grade but it is totally worth it! I Feel like I have learned a lot and have improved as a speaker! You can tell he cares about his students and wants them to gain knowledge from his class. I would definitely recommend taking his class!"
5557,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Collins's class was great, I took the class for a mini and it was awesome, there was 1 speech presentation, 2 videos to assess, and 6 question from 6 chapter from the text book every week. He gives instant feedback to work, and reply to mail within 6 hours. He gives the privilege to make choice of topic to speak on. But you have to be serious"
5558,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,4.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed taking Public Speaking with Professor Collins. He chooses great material for examples that appeal to all types of students. He gives feedback promptly after every speech. You do have to read the textbook, understand the material, and practice the speeches, but you will leave a better speaker by the end of the semester."
5559,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,4.0,"Looking for the perfect online professor? Look no further. Amazing content that really makes you feel as if you're learning in an in-person class, but very independent and time flexible. Few graded assignments, but they hold a high grading percentage. He will make you work for your grade, but it's so worth it. Take him!"
5560,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1318,5.0,3.0,Great professor! Quick response time and excellent feedback
5561,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,1.0,"I took this class online. However, I wish I would had taken it in person because it would had made the speeches easier with having an audience. Overall, it was a great class! There are 4 speeches and 6 discussions. The professor replies to your messages and updates grades pretty quickly. His feedback is always positive. You should take his class!"
5562,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,4.0,Professor Collins was great! He wasnt easy but he wasnt impossible as long as you put in the work! He gave a good time between speeches and graded them pretty fast! Would definitely recommend for all!
5563,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,5.0,4.0,"Good grade  effort! You have to memorize your speech (requires rehearsing it a lot) and deliver it well in order to make a good grade, and he gives you feedback on speeches and responds to emails in a timely manner. The most difficult thing was finding 5 people for my audience. He works with you if any unforeseen circumstances come up"
5564,1891584,Christian,Collins,Lone Star College (all),Speech,SPCH1315,4.0,1.0,Professor Collins was a great teacher! I took his class online in a summer session 2. His grading criteria/instructions were clear and gave you a freedom in creating your speeches. His feedback was really helpful; it showed how much he cared for the class and their progress. Responsive and caring. Do your best on your speeches and you'll succeed!
5566,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,3.0,4.0,"She does not provide lectures but is available 24/7 and responds really quick to emails. There were a lot of tests and the test time is super short, did not like that. If you do well with just reading the text book, this prof will be just fine."
5567,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,4.0,3.0,"She is constantly sending emails about a due date for the test. Check emails all the time. You take 6 quizzes ( drops the lowest), discussion boards, and the final exam. No book is mandatory because she supplies powerpoint slides over the chapters. One essay (8 pages over 4 topics she supplies, you only choose one)."
5568,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"EASY! No complaints whatsoever! frequent email reminders. NO LATE WORK. Free textbook. Read chapters, listen to powerpoints, take notes, and learn the vocab. 1 discussion &amp; reply post for each ch. &amp; tests can be taken twice. 5pg paper over any 1 of the 4 topic options. Review notes &amp; tests for final. Can work as far ahead as you want."
5569,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,4.0,3.0,"She was a good teacher. the lectures weren't amazing but she made them interesting. She said no extra credit, but she ended up giving a couple of chances for extra credit (don't expect extra credit. she's an interesting person, has stories from working in the psyc field, she's energetic (aka not lazy and won't slack off). she gives back grades soon"
5570,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,"Although I struggled through the class, I stayed in contact with her over email and she was extremely helpful when it came to my grades. She is very uplifting and ready to get to know and help her students with whatever they need. It is an online course yet the homework load is minimal. Take her online classes! you're guaranteed to succeed!"
5571,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,"I took Dr. Henry during the 19-20 spring semester - the Covid one. She made herself available 24-7. She has very clear grading criteria and a genuine love for teaching. Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you missed less than 3 classes she'd drop your lowest grade. Group presentations are graded by the class. Pro tip: study from the practice tests!"
5572,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,1.0,1.0,"in this class i had bad experience, she will never tell you your average in the class, if you ask her about it she will tell you that you have to wait until the end of the semester. also make sure you reply on discussions because she does not tell you that at the beginning or in the syllabus. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND HER AS A PSYCH TEACHER"
5573,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PYSCH2301,5.0,3.0,"Professor Henry has been an amazing professor! I was struggling to stay motivated during the COVID-19 pandemic and she has been nothing but encouraging, supportive and understanding throughout the semester. She responds quickly to emails and is always ready to answer any and all questions you may have. Best professor I have had :)"
5574,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,2.0,"Great online prof. Emails you a lot, reminders and answers to your emails. Great class, free text Would take again, really funny, even in emails. Classes very organized."
5575,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,GENPSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Prof Henry may be a small woman but she's sharp as a tack, and really up beat (energetic). Her lectures are very interesting and informative, the textbook helps, especially with the group project. Tests can be very difficult, so study hard, listen well, and take good notes; if you ask she'll let you record her lectures. She's just awesome period."
5576,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Prof Henry was such a real gem! She has such a bright and funny personality that would make sense of why she is a psych prof! I really enjoyed her class as it was a very fun environment! the hw was just small papers and tests were usual on where you have to study a bit, but do not let that discourage you from taking her! The textbook is free too!"
5577,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,GENPSYC2301,4.0,2.0,"If you're taking any Psychology class, I recommend taking her. She has made this semester a breeze. There is an 8-page essay that you must complete, but she's laid back with the topic and just lets you write whatever and her criteria is easily accessible. She's funny, caring, and makes class enjoyable. I highly suggest taking her hybrid class."
5578,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Henry is great! There is a normal amount of tests, but no homework aside for a chapter review for the tests. Her lectures are amazing and she makes them fun &amp; enjoyable. The only con of the class is the 8 page paper!"
5579,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,2.0,"So this class consists of 6 tests, one 8 page paper over a book, and discussions. There is usually one test and one discussion per week. The work is very simple because the test questions can be found directly from the book or the internet. She is very responsive and an easy grader. She has a great attitude and I would recommend her class to anyone"
5580,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,4.0,3.0,"Delightful class, very straightforward teacher. If you are well disciplined the reading is no problem. There is a final paper, do it as early as you can. Generally, expect 2-3.5 hours of study six days a week."
5581,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,4.0,"Lots of reading, test are pretty tough if you have not read the chapters. R. Henry always answers emails quickly and is always available for questions."
5582,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"Easy A, just follow syllabus and her many reminders. learned a lot of psych too."
5583,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Henry, is a really good Professor. Even though her class depends on a lot of reading and her tests are timed short. She is a very supportive person, she tries to help out on whatever she cans and she will difenetly help you out of if its on her hands. I would take her again."
5584,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,2.0,"Took class online and loved it. Prof sent reminders for everything due, explained what she wanted on paper when I asked and encouraged me to stay in class when I wanted to quit because of problems at home. Glad I stayed. Would take her for another class. Listened to my problems and helped me out. Caring."
5585,491415,Raquel,Henry,Lone Star College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,3.0,3.0,"I like how she sends emails throughout the semester reminding you when tears are due, but I completely dislike how when I would email for help and further description on an 8 page paper that was due she basically told me Im not giving you info, and I quote Im not sure how youve passed any of the tests. I dont think I would recommend her."
5587,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,AP2,5.0,5.0,"He is very positive and encouraging, encourages questions and makes sure everyone understands what he is teaching."
5588,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,2.0,4.0,"The class is very lecture heavy as in he just reads off the PowerPoint, stops you from taking notes during the lecture, and is his lectures are very monotonous. His tests are also very hard and he's rude when replying back to emails and such which makes it hard to ask questions so you're really on your own if you end up having him."
5589,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,2.0,5.0,"Took this class in a summer session during Covid-19, probably not the best choice. Extremely stressful, its ALOT of material to squeeze in a five week period. You'll basically be teaching yourself. Exams are difficult(100 questions in lockdown browser) &amp; alot of assignments. BE PREPARED TO BE BEST FRIENDS WITH YOUR TEXTBOOK IF YOU WANT TO PASS!"
5590,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,2.0,5.0,Took during COVID. He didnt try to assist us much and he responds to emails very rudely. Each test is 100 questions. Do your best on hw but test matter the most. Be prepared to teach yourself. He isnt the worst but he shows no sign of concern. Make sure you look at materials he posts and attend the few online lectures he decides to have.
5591,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,2.0,5.0,I do not understand where the 5 star ratings come from. Took this class during covid summer and was very hard to reach out to. Professor replied to 20% emails I sent and mostly replied with arrogance. Test reviews were almost useless. Last class I had to take in Lone star and ruined my 4.0. Very stressful 5 weeks of my life.
5592,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,5.0,I do not recommend taking this class online but due to COVID-19 this was the only option. A&amp;P 2 is a rigorous subject that is just better to learn in person. I took this class in a summer session. Entirely too much information in 5 weeks. Be ready to read straight from the test book and practically teach yourself. He can be rude as well.
5593,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,1.0,5.0,Pick another professor! Heavy work load plus 100 question exams with only a hour to spare. He sets you up to fail. Take this warning please. This man is very unprofessional and does not actually teach the criteria this class is self taught. A lot of reading and self teaching if can pick someone else
5594,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,1.0,5.0,Do not take this man if you know what is best for your college career. He is very stubborn and do not care about anything such as this global crisis affecting your everyday life. He gave me two zeros on major lectures because he felt I didnt notify him away and proceeded to be very rude. 100 questions exam with only a hour plus a lot of assignment
5595,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,3.0,1.0,This class is difficult to begin with however I would not recommend him for various reasons. This class is not structured at all you are on your own!! he solely teaches from power point and his review is to laugh at its a word document thats all jumbled together labs dont have reviews honestly some of these reviews cant be real or truthful
5596,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kandeh is a sweet fun guy, he is very smart and knows his stuff, his goal is to make sure we do too, his speech is very eloquent and he is not rude to those who take longer to grasp certain concepts, A&amp;P is a hard class to begin with and we obviously need to study but I hope he goes easy on us with the exams!"
5597,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,AP1,5.0,4.0,"I took Kandeh for both A&amp;P1 and A&amp;P 2 and even though it was hard for a community college course, he drilled everything I needed to know to take my HESI and TEAS exam. I think his class is SO worth it if you are looking to go into the health field. His way of teaching was interactive so we would not only pass the exams but also learn the material."
5598,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,4.0,"great teacher, seriously helps you understand the material he explains everything really well. cares about his student, must attend a class he tells what will be on the test. ignore the bad comments to take his class."
5599,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2402,1.0,5.0,I have done 4 years of college total and this is by far the worst teacher Ive EVER had INCLUDING HIGH SCHOOL!! His accent makes it hard to understand what hes saying most of the time. His tests are like 11 pages with 80 mins to take. Reads right off PowerPoint. Gives out a weird vibe. I wouldnt suggest him to my worst enemy.
5600,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,AP2402,5.0,3.0,Miss class and you will miss a lot of information. He is the type of professor you will remember forever because of the level of professionalism and knowledge. He is an amazing professor.
5601,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,1.0,3.0,very lazy and doesn't like students taking notes or being on laptops or phones
5602,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,1.0,4.0,"Anatomy is already a hard class but this professor doesnt make it any easier for you. Late to exams, unprepared with teaching lectures and labs, and rude to students who dont laugh at his jokes. Lecture is 50 anatomy/50 stories from his country. Immature overall. Dont recommend ����"
5603,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"He is only there to teach you. He will repeat details that are very likely to show up on your exams. Do not be afraid to ask questions when you are unsure of something he is teaching. It is better to get it clarified than take a hit on your exams. Provides you with a vast number of resources, USE THOSE. Amazing teacher! Made me work for my A!"
5604,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, Mr. Kandeh is an amazing teacher. His lectures are clear and concise, and he always gives hints as to what is going to be on the exams. Anatomy IS NOT EASY so you cant blame the teacher for getting a bad grade in a class because you didnt take the time out to study. Hes just there to teach you not to make the information stick. STUDY!"
5605,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,AP2402,2.0,4.0,I would not recommend taking this professor. He pretty much just reads off the PowerPoint the entire time. Expects you to know every detail right after he goes over it. Tests are 100+ questions plus essays. Gets off topic a lot. I did not enjoy his class.
5606,1006657,Milton,Kandeh,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2401,1.0,5.0,"Teaches from powerpoint, gets mad if you take notes during lecture, will stand in front of board to prevent you from taking notes, thick accent and grades heavily with spelling but you cant look at board to see exaclty the word he is saying. Told me to drop out for a major I already practice in."
5608,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"Stop looking further. Took this as an online class for the fall semester. The easiest class. If you're looking for a handed A, and just need this for credit, take this professor. ALL quizzes on quizlet, all multiple choice sections on exams are on quizlet, essay sections on exams can be found online as well. Super easy, really recommend!!"
5609,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIS1302,5.0,1.0,I really liked this professor. The quizzes were exactly like the exams and he wasn't a very hard grader. I think this class is an easy A if you put in the effort.
5610,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"The best professor ever! I took this class online for 1301 and 1302. Everything is open on the first day.

He opens all assignments the first day so you can finish it with it 1-2 weeks, if you put the work to do so. I'm taking HIST 1301 with him during spring 2020. He is great and you would learn a lot about History. Easy ""A""!"
5614,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Easy A, opens the whole course on the first day of class which is nice because you can finish everything very quickly. Beware of due dates, however. Three exams that consist of both multiple choice and short answer questions. Thought piece over two books but was still easy to complete. Take him!!!"
5615,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,2.0,3.0,"Pretty easy class, enjoyed working at my own pace since he opened all the assignments for the full semester from the beginning. Though beware of due dates. I missed one exam because I did not see it under the quizzes tab (where all the other exams were located) and when I emailed him he never responded. Easy grade just an unreliable professor."
5616,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Currently taking his class and will proceed to take 1302. Amazing prof, opens everything the first day of class. I love that you work at your own pace, most quiz/ tests answers are found online. Be aware he does have short answer portions sometimes, but those are fairly easy and can be found online as well."
5617,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"I would certainly take Dr. Ellis's class again if I could. He opens every assignment on the first day of class, so as long as you submit assignments by the set due dates you can work at your own pace."
5618,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"One of the best online classes I have taken, Professor Ellis opens up the entire course for you to work at your own pace which was a huge benefit for me. Take this class, you won't regret it. Discussions, quizzes (with more than enough time to complete 10 questions), 2 papers, midterm, and final."
5619,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Best online class ever taken. All quizzes and assignments are open throughout the entire course so you can work at your own pace. Quizzes are by far so easy (10 questions, 2 hours). I passed the class with a 98 and the teacher is really outgoing and understanding, couldnt recommend a better professor!"
5620,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,Take this class you wouldn't regret it. I took it online. He opened everything on the first day and let you work at your own pace. All the answers are online. It was a very easy class for me. I didn't put much effort.
5621,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"I took the online summer course and it was great because he opened all assignments (including mid- term &amp; final) so that you could work at your own pace. Required 4 books. 2 were for an essay, 1 for quizzes/tests, and 1 for the discussion boards. Very clear expectations and grading criteria."
5622,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Super easy class. I took it online. All the answers are online, didn't need the book. Learned a lot from him. Take him!"
5623,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,Professor Ellis was awesome! Never saw him because it was an online class but I love the way he formats it. He opens up all the assignments in the beginning of the semester along with due dates so you can do it all on your own time. Definitely recommend him for online courses!

5625,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIS1302,5.0,2.0,"I am not from United States, but this professor helped me understand American history. He has books which were cheap, but you can read them online if you want. It was an easy class for me"

5627,1449523,Blake,Ellis,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"I took Dr. Ellis' 3 week May minimester and I loved him! He's very passionate and knowledgeable about history. He also makes it very clear how to achieve your desired grade in the class. Only 2 tests, 10 ""take home assignments"", and one paper. 25% of your grade is just from coming to class and taking the pop quizzes or showing up on time."
5629,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIOL2402,3.0,4.0,"Know if you choose this professor that this is not going to be a "" easy A "" you will have to work for your grade. ( Lecture and Lab exams) there are no lecture videos, but she does provide youtube videos of others explaining the concept. Also, there are 2 dissections. You are mainly graded on lecture and lab exams, but she provides you the info."

A&amp;P is not an easy class but professor Tynes is there for you and will help you with anything she can, she gives a lot of examples and videos to help you understand the topic. Took her online, lab book is a must"

5636,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,AP2401,5.0,4.0,"Online 6 week course. If not already familiar with AP, take 2404 first. Quizzes are unlimited, Lec Exams can be medically wordy, Labs exams and 2 at-home dissections which were FUN! Took as an extra class on top of full-time class load and still managed an A. Gives extra credit! She's available when needed! No final! Login 3-4x wk for attendance!"
5637,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIOL2401,5.0,5.0,"LOVED her 8 week online Anatomy 1 course. She provided EXCELLENT materials, notes, videos, and reviews that helped ALOT. I may also mention that I had 5 other classes along with this one. This class takes a LOT of WORK, time and COMMITMENT. Don't get behind! Later units DO reflect on the prior units. USE THE BOOK!!! Reflect on everything else. (:"
5638,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,Challenging enough that I felt I learned a lot from the coursework but made it possible to receive the A as long as you follow the syllabus.
5639,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,Absolutely love Professor Tynes so much Im taking her class again next semester for Bio 2402. She makes sure she is easily accessible for any concerns outside of class and even after class. She is a very fair grader. And she even provides a chance for extra credit. If you cant pass her class its because you werent putting enough effort.
5640,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Tynes is amazing. I had her for Nutrition and A&amp;P I and II.

Love her!"
5641,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"Not an easy class, you have to work for your grade but professor Tynes is ready to help you in any way she can, she has tons of videos and examples to make the subject understandable and is available (outside of class) most of the time when you have a question. lab manual is a must that will help you get an A in your lab exams. taking her again."
5642,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO2401,2.0,3.0,"All her test are online besides a couple of lab exams. The only thing you need is the lab manual. I never used by textbook so it was a waste of money. I would recommend using the money to buy a printer bc she requires you to print out your notes for lectures. Overall, the class was fine and I would take her again. Be ready to teach yourself."
5643,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIOL2401,1.0,5.0,"the most condescending, hypocritical, untimely, unprepared professor ever. god awful at responding. if you want a question answered get your classmates contact info."
5644,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIOL1408,4.0,5.0,"This class was challenging, but I did learn a lot! It is not something you can skim through by making just a little effort. You will have to read the text, the provided notes and watch the short videos reinforcing the concepts. However, the professor is very clear in her grading rubric, responds to emails and very organized."
5645,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO1408,4.0,4.0,do EC which most are due on wk one. tests are 100 q and hard. lab exams easy if you print them out before and answer them. keep doing quizzes until u make an A because this helps your grade. make sure to post on weekly discussions. no looking up answers during exams cuz she uses lockdown browser unless u use your phone.
5646,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO1408,2.0,5.0,"Took her online for summer. Horrible ,cramp 15 chapters in 5 weeks and too much reading along with discussion questions, labs,quizzes. If you work full time you will struggle. DO NOT TAKE HER"
5647,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO2401,4.0,3.0,I have mixed feelings about this professor. I am taking her again next semester. Unfortunately the book changed for AP1 this past semester so she had to rewrite all tests and quizzes. A LOT of information. LONG tests and practicals. However do the work and she offers quite a bit of extra credit. Hopefully AP2 with her will be way more smooth.
5648,780210,Alanna,Tynes,Lone Star College (all),Anatomy,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"I really enjoyed this professor. Lots of homework.

5671,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL7736,1.0,5.0,"She was so terrible, I created an account just to warn others not to take her. I took her online &amp; she emailed me THREE times berating me for not putting 8hrs a day into her class. Ironic because now it is a day before classes end and she does not have a single grade in. Her tests are DREADFUL too. She will give you 200 question tests twice a week!"
5672,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,3.0,"I loved Professor Crowder! She breaks everything down to ensure students understand the material. If you study, do the crossword puzzles, and Quizlet, you'll be successful! If you want an A, you have to work for it and make sure you understand the material instead of memorizing things."
5673,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"Pretty hard class because of so much information, but it is doable! There is a quiz at the beginning of each day! Tests are so long, but there are a couple of extra credit questions! READ, READ, READ, AND RE-READ!! This information will stick if you read over it a couple of times. You will be fine if you do the crossword puzzles !! Good Luck!"

5675,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"Prof Crowder is amazing! It was honor to learn from her. Set yourself up for success in the beginning so you will be rewarded in the end. Listen to her audio recordings, do quizlet, and CWPs. You have a lab quiz everyday but it's not that bad. Repetition is key to passing this class! Good Luck!"
5676,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,4.0,4.0,"She is very informative. The tests are about 125qs, but you are given enough time to take them. Makes real world connections to lectures and labs are fun. However, take this class by itself if you can as it is very rigorous and mainly based off of tests no assignments."

5679,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,2.0,5.0,"She is the hardest professor Ive ever had. Her tests are like 120-200 questions! A lot of us were struggling the whole semester even with all the extra credit! I studied every day and night and could never get a high grade. Im normally a straight A student, but did not even get close to an A. Shes nice, but really HARD!!"
5680,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,3.0,5.0,"Crowder's class is VERY Very hard. I studied really hard and did not come close to a good grade. Her lectures and labs were not boring, it was just a lot. There is also a quiz almost every single day. Tests are between 150-250 questions, including multiple choice and short answer part.

Do the crosswords she has for review and end of lab questions. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! You can pass if you put in work. She gives extra credit on each test which are fill in the blank. I would of made a better grade if I studied more
5683,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,5.0,"Prof. Crowder follows her syllabus reliably and is a fast grader. Everything you need is provided. I had a biology teacher last semester (Allen)-inferior in every way to Crowder. Crowder does not insult students or belittle them. She uplifts. I can see why her reputation dazzles, while others (Allen) are hated. Avoid Allen like HIV. Take Crowder."
5684,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,5.0,4.0,Professor Crowder is the best teacher I've had in my 2 years at Lone Star. I cannot believe how much I've learned this semester. I feel better prepared for nursing school and the healthcare arena. Her class was a joy and a privilege. She deserves high praise. I was honored to have been taught by her. Do yourself a favor and take Prof. Crowder.
5685,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,4.0,4.0,"This class is HARD but she made it as easy as she can without just handing out A's. You have to study every note, crossword and lecture powerpoint to do well but she gives you all the tools needed to do well. Lots of extra credit. You don't want to miss a class because the amount of notes is very heavy and hard to catch up on if you miss them."
5686,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. Informative, easy to understand since she explains everything well. I have had other biology teachers who did not do a quarter of what she does to help us. Would definitely recommend."

5688,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIOL2420,5.0,5.0,"Mrs. Crowder is the jewel of Lone Star. I have never had a teacher like her, she prepares you for exams with the utmost of sensitivity and makes learning the material enjoyable. She is a precious soul. She reminds me of a person that I would love to become. She has encouraged us and enabled us to succeed. The work is challenging, but achievable."

5690,152200,Carol,Crowder,Lone Star College (all),Biology,BIO2420,4.0,5.0,"Beware of taking this class in 6 weeks. The last test is a combination of 2 tests - the final exam &amp; the final unit. The final unit is 100 pages and the time constraint makes it nearly impossible to do well. You could still be saved by her EC and lowest grade replacement, which I was. But, why take a gamble?"
5692,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,I took hist 1301 8weeks online and I wouldnt recommend if youre taking a lot of other classes. He only grades test A &amp; B and a project. I wouldnt take this class in person please just trust me. Part A of the test in matching and part B is 2 essays in 50 mins. He gives you 5 prompts so if you just write them before and paste in youll be fine.
5693,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,2.0,4.0,"5 Tests. Just memorize like 40 dates/events and 20 rivers. His river pictures r terrible, I used arcgis map for rivers n print them out and quizlet for dates/events. Essay in each test n he allows like 2 days to turn it in online. Lectures are SO boring. Learned nothing attending. Very organized n has all the lecture notes on d2l but hard to read."
5694,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,Dropping this class after 4 weeks. He just uploads material and checks out. I studied for the test and made a 6/50. Gives you 50 minutes to write TWO 5 paragraph essays. DO NOT RECOMMEND
5695,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"I took his 6 wk class online. Weekly tests consisted of multiple choice questions and two essays. He literally gives the answers to all of the multiple choice questions in quizzes. Final project was easy, just read the required material. I read the textbook, but it really wasnt needed. Use his handouts for the essay and quizzes."
5696,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"I took Professor Fox during the summer for 6 weeks. Honestly, was not bad at all. His layout is straight to the point. If you actually do the work and dont procrastinate, its a guaranteed A. Take him! You wont regret it"
5697,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,"Mr. Fox is quite a character. Nice guy but his tests are insane. Especially when we switched to online, the questions were nearly impossible even if you did study. In person, the tests were ok but you have to know a bunch of rivers and dates. Waste of time. Look for another professor."
5698,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"I took his class online. This professor is horrible. His whole semester consist of 5 tests with ridiculously specific essay prompts and a final essay that you have to read 2 books to write. Plus, he never mentions in the syllabus you have to read these books. Brought my GPA down for no reason, and he is impossible to get a hold of."
5699,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,3.0,"Fox is one of the most frustrating teachers i've ever had. Grade is made up of 5 tests, and a final essay. 40% of each test is locating rivers. Rivers are irrelevant to his lectures, which are all over the place anyway. It's an ok class if you don't mind memorizing, but his lectures are so hard to sit through. I would not re-take."
5700,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,5.0,This class was extremely hard for me. I struggled looking for the text book he wanted. I couldnt order it and have the book in time. I would recommend taking this class for a full semester not a summer class. Too much to read in a weeks time. I had to drop him to keep my GPA high.
5701,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,took him for online summer. He is very specific about what he wants and how he grades it. No surprises. Lots of reading from the preloaded pdf's but I feel like I have a good understanding about the History period. Good organized professor.
5702,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"""meh"" class. You have to attend. 5 tests (with test previews on D2L) of 30 dates and 20 rivers. I used quizlet for the dates &amp; Scribble Maps for the rivers and got A's. He posts lectures, use them for the test essays. Review the end of year project way before it's due, there is a lot to read. His lectures are super lame, I wasnt inspired."
5703,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,Took him online. Decent history material that you self teach. Material isnt hard. Study his quizes because they are exactly like the test. No weekly discussion posts. 5 tests and one major paper due at the end of the semester. Easy grader as long as its obvious that you put for some sort of effort. Prompt on email and disscusion board questions.
5704,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,4.0,2.0,Second time taking this professor for History. I would reccommend him because it's an easy A. He posts test reviews on D2l and they're the exact items that are on the test. 40% of the test is an essay with no set word requirment and its an easy 100. 40% is date matching events to dates. 20% is a map you have to memorize. Don't buy textbook.
5705,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,This is my third class with him and i I would want him to teach me in every subject. He post test previews on the D2L and thats basically all you need to study to pass! He is super easy and if you pay attention he is very sweet and funny!
5706,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,GEOG1303,4.0,1.0,Not a tough grader at all. Very easy A considering the fact that all the questions used for the tests are posted with answers in advance
5707,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,1.0,"He has really clear system - 5 tests and the course essay, all the questions are posted with answers. No book needed, he posts pdf's with 5 pages of needed material. I took this class online, loved it. A little bit of memorization and you'll pass. He is not a tough grader. Just do the assignment and he'll give you the highest grade. The easiest 100"
5708,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,3.0,"Fox has to be the toughest grader I've ever encountered. Quizzes and tests are easy, but the essay questions are a nightmare. He'll give you a zero, and not answer his emails when you ask what you're doing wrong. I had to take HIST 1301 with him TWICE before I passed."
5709,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,"Online class - 5 tests and 1 final essay. Test questions/answers in quiz sets. 9 essay topics in each of the first 4 chapters, 4 essay topics in 5th chapter. Only one essay on each test chosen at random. Test essays can be a bit challenging, but an A is possible if you take the time to study. Don't buy the book - all info accessible online."
5710,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,The professor tends to ramble and doesn't use many examples and visuals. Most like you will end up falling asleep. The class is very easy to pass though and the tests are pretty consistent. Essays are done at home and submitted online so there is no pressure to cram it in one class period.
5711,261644,Clifton,Fox,Lone Star College (all),History,HST1302,1.0,4.0,"His teaching style may suit some, but most, you'll find yourself falling asleep in class and crying yourself to sleep at night after the ridiculous essay prompts that he grades incredibly hard. The only grades in his class are tests, so you have to do good. Which is kind of hard considering his reviews are only somewhat relative to the test."
5713,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"If you are thinking of taking him definitely do it! This was my first math class and his video lectures are so helpful. He gives you weeks in advanced to do your work and most of them are just quizzes, super easy! And a few test also super easy. Take him you won't regret it."
5714,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,2.0,"This was my first math class in college, and I can honestly say Prof. Braatz is amazing. I understand what he is teaching us from the videos he posts on d2l. Grades are there so you'll know your progress along the way. Exams are like quizzes, pay attention to videos to know the material."
5715,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1316,3.0,2.0,"Currently taking course and he is switching grading process as class goes on , it isnt really fair but thankfully the course will be ending soon."
5716,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,"I took professor Braatz for math 1314 and his class is pretty easy. We had to watch videos of him lecturing which would help us in our homework. During class he didn't lecture instead, we did our homework and he walked around to help us. He explains his videos really good and his tests are exactly like the homework. I would totally recommend him."
5717,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,Very kind and helpful. If you struggle with math Id highly recommend him. Hes good at explaining concepts and is really easy to get a hold of if you have any questions. Im bad at math and still managed to learn a lot and do well in the class. You won't have to buy the textbook but you will need the Pearson access code for the homework!
5718,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,only reason I put a lot of homework is because I struggled at math. Easy to email after class for help &amp; even made a couple of extra math videos to help me understand. If you're struggling JUST ASK PROF!
5719,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1316,5.0,3.0,"I wish I could have had him as my math teacher for all 4 years of high school. He explains everything very clearly and traces all formulas/equations to their origins so you understand without having to memorize. You need to do all the homework and really do study for his tests. Attendance isn't required but unless you're a math whiz, you should go."
5720,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"Well since I took a hybrid class, it was a bit different because all of the work was done online. If we had any questions we'd just ask him when we got to class. Great Prof. and person in general. Homework was a bit much, but doable. Very organized online work. Would definitely take again."
5721,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,Took him online during summer and it was an easy A+. There's only 4 tests and few homework assignments every week. He teaches so well that it's hard to not understand the topic. He goes in detail with literally everything. Just study the videos well because that's exactly what's on the test. Show ALL work on tests too! I highly recommend him!
5722,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,Took Online. Videos were very detailed and informative. Good communication with timely response made class much easier.
5723,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH03141314,5.0,5.0,"He is a good professor. Your grade will be based on 4 tests and a final. He explains well of the material (tend to over-explain) and he is very hilarious. He gives you A LOT of practice because College Algebra is NOT AN EASY CLASS. Overall, good professor, very funny, but the class is hard and I took with the CoReq. Practice makes perfect."
5724,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH03101202,5.0,3.0,"He was my favorite professor in Lonestar North Harris. I took his co req class and let me tell you, I was terrified of failing! But he explains SOO WELL. Hes so funny and makes lectures interesting. You can tell he loves teaching and really cares about his students. Your grade is based on four exams and final. I recommend this teacher!"
5725,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,Taken with coreq 0314. Explains concepts in easy to understand illustrations. Gives lots of time to practice. Fair and pleasant. Very helpful during office hours. Does not overcomplicate exams; material is challenging but designed to test understanding of basic concepts vs difficulty for difficulty's sake. Lots of optional homework but not graded.
5726,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,1.0,He was def my favorite professor. I always suck at math but I took him and literally passed the class with a 97%. He made it so easy by giving us homework that wasn't heavy and the test were easy as well. take this professor!!!!!!!
5727,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,4.0,3.0,He is honestly the best prof I've taken for math. He is really good at reading the room if no one understands something and goes into detail with everything. He make sure you understand the math and not just memorize the formula. There is hw but its worth so little and the one issue is that he does not give a review for test but just take notes.
5728,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,4.0,"I have taken math 2 times and i always been disappointed because it was a hard subject for me, but professor Braatz helped me so much that i finally pass this class. Althought there was a lot of tests back to back, he made things a little bit easy for us and was also super understanding and sometimes would change our test days . awesome teacher !!"
5729,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1316,5.0,4.0,"Professor Braatz is awesome! He is very thorough with his lectures and provides so many tips and tricks to other websites online in case you can't reach him in person. I loved his lectures and learned something new from every class! He gives you all the tools you need to succeed, you just have to do your part. Will most definitely take him for Calc"
5730,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,2413CALCULUS,1.0,5.0,his class was unnecessarily hard for me and a decent portion of the other students there with me. Honor students failed and had a hard time and straight A students as well. i would recommend another professor and save yourself the headache and take a more reasonable professor.
5731,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"If I was ever struggling I wanna was given the help I needed, lectures were to the point and thorough, homework was a little challenging at times but it payed off on tests."
5732,1851410,Ryan,Braatz,Lone Star College (all),Mathematics,MATH2412,4.0,4.0,"Professor Braatz is certainly a sold choice. If you dont come to class you wont pass, but thats the case with pretty much any Calculus class you take. Definitely recommend."
5734,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Took Dr Babus in the summer. 16 chapter tests (20pts each, 2 book assignments (25pts each), 5 reaction papers (5pts each), and offers 5pt extra credit for a valuation. Some of the chapter test questions can be tricky, if you read thoroughly youll be fine. Easy grader and always responds fairly quick."
5735,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Babu is a great Professor. I would recommend. I loved how he started each class by showing us pictures of his cat and let anyone send him a picture if they wanted to show off their pets as well. Hes lectures are great. Have to pay attention, can not talking during lecture. I did use my textbook. For us he recorded every lesson, puts it on D2L"
5736,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,4.0,Graded by few things. Took him based on his good reviews but I wouldnt take him again. The lectures are boring &amp; test are not not easy to get an A on. Hes a chill guy but if you want an easy A find another professor. Trust me when I say I was in ur position looking at these reviews &amp; only take him if u like &amp; want to learn in depth about history
5737,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST2301,4.0,3.0,Good professor but the tests can be a challenge. He posts his lectures online so attendance is very lenient.
5738,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Babu is a great teacher. He hands out a list of terms and potential essay questions at the beginning of each section. Although not all topics will be covered in class, if you want an A in his class you need to study most of them. He is hilarious, loves his cat, and overall a pretty cool human being."
5739,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Explains everything clearly, and if you do what he tells you to, you can get an A. The homework is normal, just alot of reading. He makes the class fun, entertaining, and is always available to help after class. He is overall is an amazing teacher and i could not ask for more."
5740,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"6 week course. Read two 200-250 page books and two 3-5 page paper for each, 3 tests:15 multiple choice, describe 5 terms, and an essay question. Handout has 100 terms and list of possible essay questions. Interesting lectures every class, records and posts them online. Very knowledgeable teacher and receptive to questions. Will have to work for A."
5741,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,1301AND1302,5.0,2.0,"If you failed this class or made a low grade, it's because you're a terrible student or just dumb. All you have to do is show up to the lectures and take notes! Babu is the best professor I've ever taken and recommend to all. He's hilarious and makes his lectures easy to listen to. His tests are easy as are his book assignments. Easy A!"
5742,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Babu makes history interesting, and that is a hard thing to do. He presents what is expected of you at the beginning of the semester, and provides you with a ""terms to know"" list for each section. His lectures follow this list so be sure to take notes. Very easy class, show up and you'll pass. 100% would take again."
5743,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,Dr. Babu is just the best!!! He is funny and knowledgeable. I have actually been able to apply his teachings of history to current life situations. He is a big lecturer but starts each class with animal pics which is fun. His tests aren't too bad if you write notes pay attention and study your key terms. The essay questions are off his lectures.
5744,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1401,5.0,2.0,AMAZING PROFESSOR. records all his lectures so you can re-listen to them if you miss a day or need to re understand a concept. Holds review lectures before tests. Wants you to learn and is very knowledgeable. Super funny; textbook not REQUIRED but can be helpful on essay form of test to snag a few extra points from him.
5745,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Babu is a great professor. He has a wonderful command of history and is a natural storyteller. Lectures are interesting and very informative. There are two books to read (with essay assignments) and three exams. Exam format is 30% M/C, 30% short response, 40% essay. He gives you a list of possible essays ahead of time."
5746,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,2.0,4.0,Not sure how he recieved such good ratings... His tests are super hard and nothing he lectures about in class makes sense. Half the stuff he talks about ends up not being on the test either. He is a really nice preofessor but isnt good at communicating with his students. If i knew how his class was going to be I wouldnt have taken him.
5747,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST2301,5.0,2.0,"One of my favorite professors I have ever taken! He is so funny, and class is very entertaining. His class itself is pretty typical, tests consist of multiple choice, short answer, and an essay. If you do the work, you'll do fine."
5748,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,I am taking History 1302 with him. He is an awesome teacher. He likes to be called Dr. Babu. There are 3 tests and 2 book-reading based essays. He posts all his lectures online. Simple format with a lot of information that he makes easy to remember.
5749,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Very good professor, super laid back and is flexible with attendance and grading. Do your work and its an easy A."
5750,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"I took Babu for 1301 and 1302. He is amazing except for his tests. His tests are kind of complicated, I study a lot and barely pass. If you are good at listening to long lectures and learning vocab he is good. If not I wouldn't recommend because it is hard/stressful. Love him as a prof but wish he did things a little different."
5751,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"babu is amazing legit a1 he was on JEOPARDY and won,  he loves animals and shows pictures of his cat before class everytime he does talk a lot and lectures so you can't really talk to anyone and sadly because of that i can not get this cute girls number in front of me because there's no time to ever talk to her!!! if ur reading this hmu"
5752,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Puts lecture online. Lectures from start to finish. Be prepared to take notes. Tests are easy(multiple choice, identification, short answers. Gives you terms and essay questions that might be on test. study group prior to exam. Gives two essay assignments on 2 books. Funny guy. Doesn't give homework but tests are easy if you just look up terms"
5753,561988,Sethurama,Srinivasan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST13011302,5.0,4.0,"Few grades. Tests are hard, but the criteria is very clear. I put a lot of the test vocab on Anki. Babu is hilarious. Lectures are interesting and always applicable to the tests. Take good notes. Babu is genuinely interested in the lives of his students. I told him I just recently got a job teaching kids and he gave me tips on how to best teach!"
5755,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,2.0,"I took Professor Morgan's online class, and honestly it's pretty simple. There is a lot of writing but that is kind of a given. I spend probably 3 hours a week to finish all of the assignments per week. There are no late grades, because he gives you all the assignments from the start to work on. He does give feedback every paper you turn in too!"
5756,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,1301HISTORY,5.0,4.0,"Professor Morgan was a great teacher. He was tough at times, but in the end I saw he was fair. He truly cares about the students and he wants his students to learn and appreciate history. Others might say he was not fair in grading, but I say otherwise. He grades fairly AND provides feedback about why he gave me the grade he did."
5757,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,"This was a class the dept. of propaganda for the USSR would have been proud of. The class has 20 podcasts. Not one of the podcasts paint the US positively. Instead, it highlights the shortcomings, problems, and failings of America. It leaves students feeling disgusted/ashamed of the US instead of a deeper understanding of history. Do not take!"
5758,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,1301HISTORY,1.0,5.0,HOMEWORK! there are reflective essays due WEEKLY w/ other homework! one of the worst courses I've ever taken. his lectures are long and if you don't write notes fast you will fail the exams. exams are essay based. do not take him if you are a full time student. you will write so much in this class so if you aren't good at writing papers do not take
5759,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"This is by far the best summer class Ive taken. While you are required to write four essays a week with 4 discussions each, and chapter quizzes, its very entertaining and informative. You can easily get 125% on class discussions and above 100 on analyzing podcasts. As long as you do your work on time its an easy 100."
5760,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"He's very precise from the beginning of class what he expects of you. However I am pleased to say the workload helped push me to think and see points of views differently. You will have podcast analysis every week on top of your inquisitive exams and one formal paper, just don't decide to do your analysis' last minute like myself or you'll stress."
5761,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,He is awful!!! There is essays every week which I was doing okay in but then I missed some because of a family member passing and he did not care. He doesnt even have any feelings at all. If there was a zero rating I would use it.
5762,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,"Hi, i had the hardest time in his class. he assigned so much essays and i found myself really stressed out. i tried talking to him about it and telling him what was going on but he did not care. do not take him! He also gave feeback on essays but when i asked about it he simply does not care. He does not care about people feelings at all. i found."
5763,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,Im a new student that was took with him. Im not trust him because he didnt help me that much on the assignments so many podcast to have 200 words to respond the podcast and 500-600 words to complete and also he gets me stressed me out because is a lot writing and other thing he didnt understand my situation because I have stress and anxiety
5764,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"its a class with so many many podcast analysis, responses and inquisitive be ready to work really hard."
5765,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1302,3.0,5.0,I had Dr. Morgan during the coronavirus problem and I got really stressed about his class. He answers emails 1-2 weeks after you sent them and even though you have questions he is never really going to help you with them. He leaves approx. 5 hws per week. No late assignments even if your grandma dies the day the assignment is due.
5766,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"I took the 5-week online class during the summer of 2019, the first time back in college in over 43 years. I felt that Dr. Morgan was fair and honest when it came to grading and feedback. I thoroughly enjoyed the class. His syllabus is provided on day one so you are free to move through assignments as you are able, provided you meet the deadlines."
5767,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,2.0,3.0,"He assigns a lot of papers (500-600+ words) weekly, sometimes two at a time. He often cancels class even though we only meet twice a week and he does not lecture much. Our first exam was cancelled and replaced with a group project grade. This isn't a hard class but he is a bit disorganized so only take this course if you can handle frequent changes"
5768,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,If you want to only learn about slavery this is the class for you. He cancels class several times and changes the syllabus repeatedly and expects you to keep up. Class participation is half of your grade. My class was an expirement and he had no idea how to make his vision for my class come to life. It was the most unorganized class.
5769,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"This class was almost solely about slavery. Out of the 20 podcasts, 8 were focused solely on slavery; each podcast discussed slavery in some way and the formal paper was focused entirely on slavery. I realize that slavery was a key part in understanding American history, but I would have appreciated a more balanced class."
5770,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,I am a history major and this year I've honestly found myself missing this class. Took this class over the Summer. He really cares about what he's teaching and is super engaging with the class which is great. Definitely a hard class and over the summer there were three 500 word essays due every week. Really liked the fast pace. He cares.
5771,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,Assignments due every 2 weeks 5x 500 word essay on different 1 hour podcasts 5x chapters read 5x chapter inquisitive assignments 5x timed quizzes the quizzes and inquisitives can be googled for easy 100% the essays and paper seemed to be graded more on the content than the presentation. Im taking another 8 week class from him next semester
5772,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"He's really something, the passion he has for history radiates off of him and you can't help but be enveloped in the lessons. Honestly one of my favorite professors I've ever had. Just know while the work isn't hard per se there is a LOT of work."
5773,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,2.0,5.0,Anytime I asked for help he was not clear or helpful at all. He assigned way too many essays to be able to write each of them well unless you were already well educated on the topic. His grading criteria for an essay worth 20% of the final grade was NOT clear and the feedback he gave was NOT clear either. Very rude in personal feedback of essays.
5774,1471424,William,Morgan,Lone Star College (all),History,HIST1301,2.0,3.0,"He takes the class a bit too seriously and grades hard. On the final paper that I would have gotten at least a b on at my normal university, he gave me a 70. Class isn't overall bad but once you get behind good luck. Also some advice, every single inquisitive (which is 30% of the overall grade) can be copied and pasted to be found on quizlet."
5776,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,1.0,5.0,Too much hw and test were the hardest thing ever and proctored. I tried to take her during summer for chem 1033. Worst professor ever. Go to homestead campus instead! Avoid Kendall for chemistry
5777,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1046,2.0,3.0,"After reading the reviews I concluded that she would be a great professor. However, I was wrong. Maybe the virus has something to do with it but I think she's mediocre . I find the quality of her lectures and explanations below average leaving me as the student to figure out EVERYTHING. Just beware before choosing her. You'll be on your own!"
5778,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,5.0,3.0,"Professor Consul has been one of my favorites professors ever. She explains everything like if you are 5 years old. If you read the summary of the Chapter before going to class, and once there you really pay attention, you are gonna understand everything. Chemistry can be challenging but she makes it easy. TAKE HER, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!"
5779,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1046,5.0,5.0,"I learned a lot from her lectures. She gives extra credit homework and for PLTL (which i recommend taking also) the test is difficult but if you do a lot of practice problems from the textbook, you should be good. I enjoyed her lectures, it definitely wasnt a waste of time."
5780,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033L,5.0,3.0,BEST ONE AT MDC!!
5781,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1046,5.0,3.0,"If you really wanna learn and you have what it takes to study everyday, then she is the right prof for you. She is a WONDERFUL prof. Keep in mind that in this class you will learn complex concepts, memorizing is not enough but seeing and understanding the beauty behind it. Doing all the problems from the book without understanding is not the way."
5782,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,5.0,4.0,She gives opportunities for students to pass by offering extra credit along with the module homework she assigns. Its through that homework youll be able to understand and pass the class. You must study. I wouldve gotten an A or B if I studied enough. Take notes from her powerpoints &amp; practice more problems from the chem book and youll be okay
5783,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1046L,5.0,3.0,"Amazing profesor. Like someone said below, she is only an amazing professor for hard working students. If you know you are lazy and just want an easy grade, then she is not the one for you. Look for a professor who is at your level. She will teach you real chemistry. If you find it difficult, well then change majors cuz science classes get harder"
5784,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1046,5.0,3.0,"The best of the bests! I had her for 1033 and for 1046. She truly is an amazing professor. Shame on all those people writing bad comments, you all should not be allowed to be part of the STEM field. Btw, the coronavirus is not an excuse for you to fail a class. As a scientist or Dr., youll face bigger challenges. Take this as a learning experience"
5785,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,3.0,4.0,"Although she may not be as horrible as some other ratings state, she often tends to rush through the lectures and modules to cover enough for the tests. She teaches decently but what really helps are the online modules that she assigns which are mandatory. This class is not for the weak. DO NOT TAKE if you are not prepared to give 200% effort."
5786,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,1.0,5.0,THE WORST! i dont understand how a human being can have ZERO compassion. DO NOT and i repeat DO NOT give her a chance. she will destroy you mentally.
5787,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1046,1.0,4.0,"I've never been so stressed in my life. This is the first time that I've ever failed a class and I'm really upset about it. Her exams are very challenging. But her exams during the pandemic were terrible. Exams are proctored, lots of homework, lots of theory on exams, and she can be very rude. I honestly regret taking her my gpa went down a lot."
5788,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1046,1.0,4.0,"Before the pandemic honestly a very good professor. Lecture was understanding for the most part (it's chem you have to put in a a lot of work on your own anyways) during this pandemic she made the class WAY MORE stressful than it needed to be. She had no empathy, consideration or understanding for anyone. Do not recommend her online!"
5789,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1046,1.0,5.0,"I'd recommend her before the pandemic. But during the pandemic, she was the only chem 2 prof who had proctored tests. Which I think is fair, if both of the profs did. The problem is her tests ARE VERY CHALLENGING. It is very hard to keep up with her -online. And she has LOTS of students. You won't get much attention&amp;help."
5790,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1046,1.0,5.0,"RUN don't walk away. THE worst prof I ever had in my life.A nightmare during the pandemic. Didn't lecture, did NOT answer questions, did proctored tests (the other profs did not have proctoring). Was very defensive &amp; lashing out at us. Her tests are sooo much harder than the lecture&amp;homeworks. I have nothing against her. Just wanna warn others"
5791,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1046,1.0,5.0,"I took this class with Consul during the Covid-19, I got an A in the class not because she taught, but because I taught myself. If you want a teacher DO NOT TAKE HER. Does not care for her students only doing the minimum effort to finish the semester."
5792,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1046,1.0,5.0,Do not recommend. She had zero consideration in an already difficult class during the pandemic and made the class more difficult. She goes swiftly through new chapters and then tests you on them the same week. Your grade depends mainly on how well you do on her tests as the HW is weighted very little. Would not take again.
5793,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1046,3.0,5.0,"She really didn't take into consideration that students are taking more than 1 class online w/ this whole pandemic situation . She gave TOO MUCH material to learn in such little time. She is very easy to contact though, and if you have questions she there, but I honestly wouldn't take her again."
5794,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,4.0,4.0,"I had a good experience with Diaz. Her lectures are clear, if you ask her to explain she will, During the COVID-19 pandemic, she made several versions of the lessons which helped me. If I had any questions it was easy to email her and ask. Everyone who says otherwise wanted to cheat their way through the class. Get ready to study though."
5795,1260454,Julia,Diaz-Consul,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,2.0,5.0,"Worst experience at MDC. The majority of our chem1033 were dissatisfied with Julia. I dont know how shes gotten any good reviews at all. I studied all the time, sometimes 10 hours a day, and still ended up with a C. She moves really fast through modules and her tests have 4 different versions so some people had easier tests. Glad its over."
5797,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP1006,5.0,3.0,"One of the best profs. I've ever had. He truly cares. Teaches you useful things for life, not just your major. I still use his meditation techniques. And I still know how to juggle! Meditation classes can be expensive but he taught his classes for free, and that's amazing. Great lectures. You will ALWAYS use the book. You HAVE to read for quizzes."
5798,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP1006,5.0,4.0,"Abascal is extremely passionate about the subject. If your willing to pay attention to his lectures and incorporate it to your daily life, then take this class. I strongly recommend this class to college freshman. Theres also quizzes like every other class so read the book on the daily."
5799,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,2.0,"Great Professor, I really enjoyed his lectures. Very passionate about human sexuality and the diversity of it. It really inspired me. I gained a lot throughout this class, not just course materials but knowledge on sexuality. Information I can use. He's awesome"
5800,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,1.0,He is a great professor. I looked forward to going to his class. I usually do not enjoy lectures heavy classes but his are interesting and engaging. Recommend.
5801,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP01006,5.0,3.0,Probably one of the best professors I've ever had.
5802,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,4.0,"Professor Abascal is amazing. Before i took Human Sexuality i considered going into Music Therapy for my specialty once i graduate. He completely made me fall in love with the subject and has made me want to become a sexologist. His class is all lectures, but extremely engaging. He is extremely caring and is always interested in his students."
5803,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Abascal has been, hands down, the best professor i've ever had. His class is lecture based, and there are 6 exams. No midterm or Final. His material is incredibly interesting and engaging. He is truly a gem, take him for any Psychology course, but i recommend SOP2772 (Human Sexuality)"
5804,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP1006,5.0,3.0,"Oh how I am going to miss Professor Abascal. He has to be one of the best professor's that I have had here at MDC. He is very inspiring, funny and wise. All you need to do in his class is participate, read the chapters, study for the quizzes and test and JUGGLE (literally)! If I were able to take him again I would."
5805,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772HUMSEX,5.0,2.0,"AWSOME! Lectures are very interesting and you learn a lot, 5 quizzes no final or mid term. He is just great awesome personality ! One of the best prof Ive had in Dade Just take him you won't regret it ."
5806,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP01006,4.0,3.0,"He  is a great professor however, hes very strict about tardiness and attendance. His lectures are fun and interesting. He gives about 12 pop quizzes and 4 test along with extra credit for not missing a class. The book is mandatory and prepare to juggle."
5807,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP2140,4.0,4.0,Overall a great professor. Funny and his lectures are mostly interesting. Strict about attendance and tardiness gives extra credit based on that which can really help your final grade! His tests are tricky! You do need to study and the book will help in case you miss something bc he is a bit fast paced. Grade based on 4 test.
5808,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,3.0,One of the most involved professors i have ever had. Great lectures and good sense of humor. Perfect attendance could grant you points towards your final grade. He covers 90% of test content in class and makes helpful study guides. Participation may matter when it comes to inconclusive matters such as asking extra credit.  NOT an easy A though!
5809,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP1240,5.0,3.0,"Loved this professor, you have to study in order to pass the exams. The study guides are a little extra compared to what you get tested on, but overall AMAZING professor. You'll learn so much with this man, his lectures are great! class is always interesting. He tries to help his students as much as he can. very inspirational. TAKE HIM"
5810,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP2140,5.0,4.0,"He is amazing! I recommend everyone to take his class! So much knowledge. His lectures are so interesting, and you are actually excited to come to class. 4 tests (No midterm and no final) and he gives you a study guide for all. Book not really needed if you're a good note taker but it helps. Extra credit offered for attendance. Best professor ever!"
5811,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP2140,5.0,3.0,Best teacher I've had at Miami Dade. Just take him.
5812,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP01006,5.0,3.0,TEST HEAVY
5813,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I've ever had. Really knows what he's talking about, and so interesting!! He makes this class so fun, I always looked forward to going to this class. I wish I could have him as a professor for all of my classes. Really amazing guy, highly recommend A++"
5814,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,CLP01006,4.0,1.0,"This class was AMAZING! Truly helped me to change the way I look at life. Taught me that all the answers are truly within ourselves. Professor Abascal was a great teacher. Ill always remember him everytime I juggle. Afterall, its because of this class that I learned how. Anything that you practice is achievable. I hope to take him again soon!"
5815,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,2.0,"This professor was probably one of the best I've seen in Miami Dade. His lectures were super interesting and clear. He gave out study guides that helped immensely with his tests. Overall, a really nice and knowledgeable person. I would completely recommend taking him if you can."
5816,457637,Juan,Abascal,Miami Dade College (all),Social Science,SOP2772,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor!! Wish I had the chance to take him again. Show up to class, take notes based on his lectures and you'll pass! 5 tests, no homework. Gives review sheet before tests. Also gives extra credit based on attendance. Makes class so enjoyable with his lectures. Take him, you won't regret it :)"
5818,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,LIT2480,5.0,4.0,"Professor Glenn, is a strict professor. Do all of the essays, questions on Blackboard and the oral presentation and you will pass! Just do it on time! He is an excellent professor. Answers all of his emails and any questions you have on the assignments. His lectures are quite funny. Participation is suggested if you take his class in person."
5819,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,Mr Glenn is a very funny guy who tells jokes all class long. Theres six essays and they all have easy topics that are all questions about yourself. The only homeworks are grammar workbook activities that lead up to the essays. I wish I could take him for another class!
5820,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Glenn was honestly one of my favorite classes this semester. He is clear on his grading and honestly not a tough grader at all. I appreciated his lectures as they were simple and easy to follow. He's pretty funny, I loved his jokes."
5821,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Glenn was by far the best and my most favorite professor ever!!! His lectures arent boring (he always tries to make them funny) he is very laidback, tells alot of jokes and gives out the most easiest topics for essays!! I would definitely take him again. Hes amazing"
5822,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,This is my first year of college and i have to say hes been my favorite professor so far. Hes very understanding when it comes to absences (something excusable). Hes really nice and funny and not biased at all. Hes handwriting is a bit wonky but its okay. He talks a lot but its engaging and actually very interesting. I love his dark humor.
5823,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Best Professor EVER!!! He is HILARIOUS!! Glenn really cares about the students, small amount of homework, a combination of take home and class essays. He made the class very engaging and fun!! Definitely taking him again for ENC 1102."
5824,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ECO1101,5.0,2.0,"He will make you laugh, and his class is very mellow. Just do your work read and work hard on your paper. He cares very much for his students."
5825,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ECO1101,5.0,4.0,Very funny. you will laugh through out the class. Do your work
5826,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,3.0,5.0,"Hes a nice and caring professor but his grading is pretty bad, he only grades around 5 essays . His grading standards are really high, he expects you to be a professional writer, if you grammar isnt extra perfect he will drop your grade to a d or f no matter how good your details, examples, etc aree!"
5827,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,Professor Glenn is amazing! He is really engaging and funny in class. 1101 material is very basic. His format of outlining and how he presents it is very easy to understand and follow. He gives enough time for short essays/papers to be completed and gives great feedback! Professor Glenn was my favorite professor this semester! TAKE HIS CLASS
5828,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,Amazing professor. He has a really original sense of humor. Hes very sweet and gives really good feedback on essays. I totally recommend Professor Glenn for ENC1101
5829,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"I love Prof Glenn, he's really hilarious and very thorough with what is expected for each essay he assigns, buy the books for homework, he assigns three in class essay's, one is the FINAL, but the rest are take home. I would definitely take him again, best professor yet. He gives the absolute best lectures."
5830,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Super nice teacher. You need to buy all three textbooks he assigns or else you just can't do the homework. He is flexible but don't take advantage. If you're absent on a day he assigns a take home essay, he most likely won't let you do the assignment at all. He has some funny jokes and really tries to make the class more enjoyable."
5831,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,Professor Glenn was one of the best professors Ive ever had EVER. He has funny lectures where he cracks jokes constantly and makes sure you learn the material. I would recommend him to anyone.  Just make sure you write the essays and do the worksheet assignments and youre good and do not miss class he grades attendance.
5832,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,He is soo nice and try to make everyone in the class laugh. BARLEY GIVE HOMEWORK. All you have to do to pass is do the 3-4 essay and your fine. Kinda of a tough grader but still easy to pass. TAKE HIS CLASS.
5833,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Glenn is a great professor. He always makes funny jokes to make the atmosphere fun and educational for his students. Now beware, his handwriting is horrible lol but he gives great feedback on essays and he does not mind helping his students after class with work or essays."
5834,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"Probably one of the best teachers I took at Miami Dade. He explains everything thoroughly, uses great examples and hes super funny. Would definitely recommend everyone to take him. Too bad he doesnt usually teach ENC1102."
5835,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,3.0,4.0,He does tell a lot of jokes nonsense that you mostly won't laugh . If you have a good GPA and English is your second language don't take him. Save your energy for a good professor.
5836,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,2.0,4.0,"If English is your second language don't him. He will fail you no matter what you do. He requires some books where you have to wipe out some pages every week for nothing. He didn't grade them. If he likes you or you laugh at his jokes all the time, you will pass his class. If you are not an american student don't take........."
5837,225980,Edward,Glenn,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,1.0,5.0,"He is super strict in grading. Homework is not for grad at all. If you are after ESOL and your grammar is not an A, do not take him."
5839,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2311,1.0,5.0,"He just kinda vaguely shows you how to work out problems, doing problem after problem skipping a ton of steps. and then gives absolutely no insight on the type of problems to expect on a test. One of the worst Professors I have had."
5840,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,Class grades consist of only 4 (?)tests. Not clear when explaining. No study guides. No online homework. Just optional book problems. Ask him a question and he replies with a slick comment. By far the worst professor.
5841,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1140,1.0,5.0,"Awful Teacher. Gives lectures and lots of homework that isnt even for a grade, let alone online. The tests are what matters with this professor. He doesnt even give a proper review for the tests. I absolutely do not recommend this professor in all honesty."
5842,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1005,2.0,5.0,"Terrible. Expects you to know everything. His teaching is bad, i had to learn everything on my own. By far the worst Professor I have ever taken."
5843,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,2.0,5.0,"The whole class is solely based on 5 Test grades. HW is not graded but it highly recommended to do. Also takes points away for small little mistakes, expecting perfection on his exams. Must know your Algebra cus he skips steps. Do NOT take this class if you are not good with math."
5844,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1023,1.0,3.0,Never take his class
5845,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,"Great professional, clear, and always willing to clarify and help his students. The class is HARD, but he is an awesome teacher. Take him if you wanna learn but be mindful, he is a tough grader and he expect you to know your bases. So dont expect curving grades or free extra credit, it won't happen. You want it, you earn it."
5846,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,5.0,"Exam makes up the whole course. No extra credit. No Graded homework (homework is to prepare you for exam), takes off points for small things like rounding one decimal place."
5847,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1114,4.0,3.0,"Listen, I decided to take prof Orr at MDC as a transient student because everyone warned me of taking the class at my uni. Trig itself is difficult. This semester started with about 27 students and the day of the final, there are only 10 left. If you want an easy a, this isnt it. He helps you understand the material and learn but it COMES DOWN TOU"
5848,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,I had to dropped the class before the first test he was extremely difficult he wont raise his voice! Dont take this professor he wont help you
5849,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,1.0,Long tests to a really short time
5850,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,he does not like to teach his students! when you ask a question he says to see him in hiss office hours which are from 6:30-7:30 am... flies through lectures and does not break down the steps to complete the problem. BEWARE. more than half of my class dropped him by the second test.
5851,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"He's very straightforward and is one of the best because of it. If you know Algebra 1, you should have no problem passing his class with flying colors. If you don't (and he will tell you himself), you are better off taking another class. Explains things clearly and only grades based on quizzes and final (5-6 total). Answers any homework questions."
5852,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"Im not one to write reviews because i honestly feel bad. but he only grades test NOTHING ELSE, if you dont understand something he will try explain it in 2 seconds and look at you like you are dumb... dont get me wrong his sarcasm is hilarious, but if you are bad at math DO NOT DO IT. the only reason i gave him a 1 is because it made me. lots of hw"
5853,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"Grades are based on only tests. His tests are way too long to complete in a short period of time. Teaches a complete different way from what you already know. He is a really tough grader, wants you to write out answers. When hes teaching he skips steps assuming you know what he did. Absolute hardest class ever and worst teacher."
5854,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,Professor Orr is a really great professor. His lectures are very clear and he is accessible during office hours to help you. He gives a lot of homework but you have a few days to do it. The tests are not too hard as long as you do the homework and study. He lets everyone know how they did on the previous test as soon as he grades it.
5855,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,5.0,"Very punctual and answers any questions in the beginning of the class. During his lectures, he tends to skip over steps assuming we know it. No extra credit and the homework is not graded. You have to go beyond and find other resources if you're poor in math and choose to take him. Grade is based on the 5 exams given and the final is mandatory."
5856,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"He's an amazing math professor, he knows the material, he answers questions. It's a hard class because all grades come from test, so you have to study hard. But if you want to learn, he is for you."
5857,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1005,1.0,5.0,Poor
5858,659414,Donald,Orr,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,5.0,"This professor is really smart and knows the material he teaches however, he chooses the hardest possible questions to put on his tests and too many questions to possibly finish on time. Tests are the only grades you will receive throughout the semester. I tried really hard in his class and did all my hw, he couldve at least give me credit for tha"
5860,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MATH1033,2.0,5.0,"If math is your weakness, I do not recommend her. Shes a wonderful person, gives you chances but as a teacher? Shes horrible. Her hwk is not hard but the catch is you have to do it her way or shell fail you on it everytime. Also she do NOT slow down for lectures, she expects you to get it and go. She watches you while you take test and quizzes.."
5861,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,3.0,"First off, shes nice but when it comes to assignments, its a different story. She would lower your grade if you dont do her math method her way and sometimes its a problem because I dont understand it. The only good thing is that she gives you a practice test that is similar to the real one."
5862,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,5.0,"If you are not good at math, I STRONGLY suggest you do not take her class. A lot of people have withdrawn because they are failing. She requires that you show your work the way she showed her work or she will take points off. Lots of hw and little time on the tests. Trust me, theres BETTER math prof out there."
5863,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,5.0,"At first, I really liked her but after the second lesson, she grew insane i swear. So many homework assignments, and the test questions were basically 10 in 1 type of questions. Everything is timed, even homework... Her teaching style is weird, instead of teaching an actual lesson, she just solves problems instead of going in depth with it."
5864,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,5.0,"Professor Wong teaches way too fast!! Sends a lot of homework, she makes you rewrite like about 15 pages of math problems for homework, plus whatever homework she sends you to do online. Its just too much and dont ever take her in a mini term unless youre good with math. Only positive thing is she lets you retest."
5865,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,1.0,She is an awesome professor. She offers help to all of her students who really need it in order to pass her class. She gives a lot of work. She gives out hw worksheets for the students to practice for 4 exams. She's a tough grader however. She has her students work on a program called Aleks.
5866,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,5.0,She let you retest thats the only good part about her class.
5867,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"Best professor ive eveR had, i cant believe she only teaches mat1033. She explains everything, step by step. A lot of work but this means more opportunities to get a high score. I love her teaching method. Highly recommend her. If you Pay attention to class and do your aleks homework you will pass her tests ."
5868,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,Professor Wong Is A Great Professor. She Will Help You To Pull Your Grades. I Recommend Her 100%. She caring for her students and want all her students to pass. If you dont understand she will do anything in her power to help you pass her class.
5869,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,3.0,"Professor Wong will make every lesson super Clear. Her notes are aesthetically pleasing and she teaches you exactly what she wants from you. There are plenty of opportunities to better your grade and for practice. She made me like math again. overall, she's awesome. Take her if you actually want to put in work and learn, if not she's not for you."
5870,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,Professor Wong is an amazing teacher who is literally willing to put in a ton of work and second chances on her end to make sure you secure a passing grade in her class. On the first day she explains how to pass her class in an efficient and manageable way. She even gives you ton of previous test answers to study from. Easy and productive A.
5871,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,4.0,Ms. Wong is honestly not a bad teacher. she explains step by step in class but gives alot of online homework and professor examples omg ridiculous. her test are difficult!! STUDY !! she gives 5 test in total and 1 pop quizzes before each test. all of her test are free response so if u don't like showing work this is not your class.
5872,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,4.0,Professor Wong was an amazing professor. She really knows how to make the subject stick to you. Homework is a little excessive but it no doubt gives you the practice that you need. She is extremely understanding and really wants you to pass the class. Don't take her if you're not willing to put in the work.
5873,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,4.0,"Alice Wong is a very nice/caring professor. She's good at her job and will often repeat things if you do not understand, and she constantly tells you her office hours. If you do not pay attention to her homework assignments or her lectures then you won't have a good time in her class. She gives ""alot"" of homework but they are not difficult at all."
5874,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,4.0,"With all the amount of work assinged, helps you practice for all the test."
5875,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Wong is a very caring individual. She gives many opportunities for makeup, and explains the material over and over. The only downside is that she gives a lot of HW, but it is easy. She also details her grading criteria extremely well. She uses Aleks ($70-$90) instead of a book, and attendance is not a big factor."
5876,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,5.0,"this class is so difficult if you don't understand math or if math is your hardest subject !!!! she is not a professor to really take time and teach the material step by step slowly until everyone gets it , the class work is bogus because you can literally leave class or put w.e and not learn anything ."
5877,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,3.0,3.0,"Shes good at teaching, but she gives an absurd amount of homework like copying class notes at home, only to rewrite them in class for a separate grade. The ways she grades tests is also pretty ridiculous making you write very specific things to get full points and sometimes you feel like you missed out on points for very dumb things."
5878,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,4.0,2.0,"I took Alice this year for summer A the 6 week course. Let me say one thing it's a lot of work but it's easy work. This Professor cares about YOU! She has a lot of extra credit and shes clear with her instructions. Its basically impossible to fail because she inflates grades with all the extra credit. I hate math, but she made it easy!"
5879,489990,Alice,Wong,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,3.0,"She's very detailed and specific, but way too much work. there's video assignments for every section before lectures. 5 tests &amp; homework online. She's great at what she does and gives extra credit, but I don't think all that work is necessary to understand the material. wouldn't recommend. I'd suggest another professor."
5881,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,One of the best math professors Ive ever had he makes math so easy and hes a great teacher YOU WILL NOT REGRET TAKING HIM hes amazing a bit of an accent but an amazing teacher! Definitely would and will take again
5882,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MATH1033,5.0,2.0,"BEWARE FRESHMEN, HE IS AT MEEK NOT AT NORTH CAMPUS LOCATION! When selecting courses on student center, make sure to select North. He is at MEEK satellite location. He is a great professor, slow pace for us that find math tricky. Homework problems per class, and one exam every 7 or so homework assignments. Very forgiving and kind."
5883,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,4.0,Best professor ever for Math 1033 I swear I hated math he made me love it and understand everything about each problems steps by steps.
5884,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"He's the best professor I have ever had. Take note, pay attention you will pass."
5885,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"I love this professor, I highly recommend. He such an amazing person,,, please take him."
5886,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,Professor Anthapan has been so far the best Professor I've had here in MDC. He cares for his students and what he lectures you is what you will get tested on (exact same thing). Make sure not to miss any class because his lectures are important. He leaves homeworks that he grades complementary to the exams. I'm sad I'm not able to retakehimforSTA2
5887,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,Professor Anthappan is one of the best Math teacher that MDC has. I will definitely recommend him to who want to take Statistics. You learn everything in class. The only thing you have to do is your homework. Thank you professor.
5888,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"HE IS GREAT. Funny and hard working. He is the only reason I took a class in the Meek building. He is really a great teacher and will make you feel ""PAIN NOW!"", to spare you pain later. STA is hard but I really felt good about the tests. Great class mates too."
5889,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,best math professor hands down!!
5890,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Prof Anthappan is amazing!! I've taken 3 of his classes. He always says ""this is the last time you'll take this class."" And it's true! He doesn't use the book. His methods may be unorthodox but if you take the notes and do the homework you'll get an A on the test. He has an accent at first but just takes a week to get used to. Def recommend!"
5891,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"He is one of the best professors at MDC. He can teach math a monkey I can swear! Its hard not to understand. There is no need to purchase a book or a code. You also dont need to complete lab hours. All you need to do is show up and do your homework, and you will not only pass but will also understand math!"
5892,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,4.0,"BEST PROFESSOR AT MDC HANDS DOWN. I'm taking stats right now and I'm no good at math as of right now I'm passing with an ""A"". He explains everything he teaches so that EVERYONE can understand gives homework that goes towards your exam grade. study you notes, he lets you know exactly what's on the exam. gives one makeup. miss class you wont pass"
5893,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,"He is the best, just give him a chance. I think he's the best professor in the world. I never could understand math until I got in his class, I heard so many stories about you will not be able to understand him, but I gave him a chance and now not only do I understand it, I think Im able to teach a class!"
5894,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"This guy Have a heavy accent, OMG!! I tried so hard to understand his way of teaching, just terrible."
5895,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"I have failed Stats twice previously to taking it with Prof Anthappan. And wow, I am so proud to say that thanks to Prof A I passed this class with a B! I did not think I was going to be able to do it. You cannot take any other professor who will break it down and make STATS more preliminary and easy to understand like Prof A does."
5896,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,EXCELLENT TEACHER!!!!! I took him for sta1033(ithink) and STA2023 if I could have him as my teacher for all of my math classes that would be my college experience much easier. His way of teaching is phenomenal! I would recommend him times 10. you can miss class just make sure you copy the notes from someone worthy
5897,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"He is great Professor, he has a very comical teaching style. You actually will learn in his class. The lectures are very thorough. Just make sure you pay attention and memorize."
5898,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Great professor make learning easy if you don't understand the problem he's go over it until you do. Homework is extra credit, there are 4 exam with at least 13 questions you will have to solve it and show work. He do exam reviews so don't worry. If you do all your work and study you'll be fine."
5899,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,Take this professor!! You wont regret it at all..
5900,647802,Paul,Anthappan,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,4.0,math is hard but he makes it simple hes the best he gives 3 tests and a final each test he adds extra points either for doing hw or just extra credit he even added 30 point on one test. if you study the notes and review youll pass but. Im good at math but its been a while since i took stats hes make it so easy to understand hes the best.
5902,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,4.0,3.0,I had him for MAC and STA and he is really nice and easy going. He explains things in a simple way making it easier to understand. Sometimes a little fast but its fine. He also sends practice test before exams. Do them and study the exercises he does in class and youll do good in tests.
5903,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,3.0,"I just want to say that I really despise math bc Im so bad at it but this professor makes it all seem so easy! I have taken him for MGF 1006 &amp; MGF 1007 + STA2023 and I received high As on all 3 courses. Take him if you have the chance, you wont regret it"
5904,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"This guy is a GOAT, made math super easy and the lectures ended pretty fast. If you need help dont be shy and ask him hes super nice. Highly recommend"
5905,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"He's a very good teacher. Takes his time to explain &amp; willing to stay after class. He provides study guides for all test. I am very bad at math and had difficulty not because he was a bad teacher but because i was bad. There is a lot of hw but he gives us the whole semester to finish it. No midterm, no final. RECOMMEND"
5906,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,Professor Alvarez is a great professor. The class consists of 4 tests and homework from Pearson. He's funny and accessible outside of class. He responds to emails and when I asked if he could look over an exam again to see if there was any mistakes (since we transitioned to online exams) he bumped my test score up. You will need to study tho
5907,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"He is super nice and very good with explaining, doesn't matter if ur late to class but as long as u show up ur good. The remote learning with this professor was over all a great experience."
5908,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,He is a very funny professor. He makes going to class enjoyable. I already registered for STA with him again. Definitely one of the funniest and easy math teachers. Super helpful.
5909,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,3.0,"Leandro is a good guy but if you actually want to learn something instead of just have him read stuff to you and you use formulas for the test, then don't take him. He is very monotone and boring. Seems like he is in a rush to leave class and shows up late. Pretty unprofessional. If you're paying for an education, you deserve better."
5910,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,4.0,"Excellent notes, clear. Nice professor available during office hours. Cares about the students and I will try to help you to understand the lesson."
5911,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,4.0,"Hes a nice professor but the class felt rushed. The organization of the course material was a little sloppy but that may not be something he controls. Also, he would analyze a problem and then talk about how the analyzation is used for an advanced math course. If your quick to learn math then you will be fine in the class."
5912,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"Hes a great lecture, makes class fun. If you study the notes, do the homework, and study your practice test you should do very well in the class."
5913,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! He's the worst professor out there! His lectures and notes are very long and are terrible. When tests come around the reviews and notes WILL NOT help you. The tests does not cover the information taught in class. There is no forms of extra credit to help you.
5914,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,4.0,I would not reccomend this professor for business calculus because he is not very clear and makes many mistakes when attempting to teach a lesson. He does make practice test but does not like going over them in class so it is better to get a tutor if you do take this class. I ended this class with a C+ after meeting with two tutors.
5915,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,4.0,"A lot of online homework. 6 test and proctored midterm and final. Tests are very hard. If you are good at math then this class will be super easy for you. If you are like me, then you will struggle because I have to figure out everything on my own."
5916,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,I took Professor Alvarez for a summer course so lectures were approximately 2.5-3 hours long with a 5-10 minute break in between. There's a lot of online homework but it's extremely helpful for when test time comes which there are 5 of and one final. You're allowed to use formula sheets for them.
5917,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,4.0,4.0,I suck at math but ended with a B. He answers all questions and explains things well. Homework is online and has a lot of helpful tools that help you pass it with 100%.
5918,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,2.0,"Professor Alvarez is amazing so Im not sure why there are bad reviews. If you have something negative to say about him, its because you did not do your part. He is very caring, hilarious and CLEAR. I took him for MGF 1106 and 1107 and I never had a problem! His tests are clear and super easy. Do the homework every day and you will be fine!"
5919,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,4.0,"He doesnt know how to teach, he basically wants you to know everything about math when you step into his class. Also the homework is an insane amount and he wont grade it with your tests so you dont even know if youre passing. Had to drop his class."
5920,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,2.0,"I do not even understand how this prof has negative reviews because he is so GREAT. It is simple. If you listen in class and ask questions, the tests and homework will be just as simple. He is extremely good at teaching and will help you with any questions you may have. I wish I could take him again but I do not even need to. I recommend him HIGHLY"
5921,721976,Leandro,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,1.0,5.0,"Honestly, I took two classes with him. The first one was difficult but I was able to manage but the second was super hard. The homework is an abundance of questions 30-50 per lesson and at the end, all the homework for the whole semester is just one grade which isn't fair. His tests are all multiple choice and 20 questions but very difficult!!!!!!!"
5923,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,4.0,"Triff was the best. I absolutely enjoyed his class so much. He's the type that likes it when his students have their own opinions and he respects them (especially if they can make a good argument for them). He gives fairly easy work and his tests are passable if you pay attention, read his notes on the website and do the homework."
5924,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,3.0,"If you need to take PHI 2604, take it with Triff. Yes, the tests are hard but if you read the book, take notes and praticipate in class, you'll pass, especially with the way he curves his exams. He's also very compassionate toward his students and helps you out whether it's with life problems or difficulties in class. He is not out to fail anyone."
5925,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,3.0,"Great professor. If you want to learn you will learn. If you just want to get over your humanities requisite, it is a great choice as well."
5926,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"The class becomes easier by always paying attention in class, being as open-minded as you can be, and respecting Triff's arguments while questioning them with logic. He recommends using flashcards for the exams and it proved to be extremely effective. He is a very understanding and loving professor that can allow you to think more critically."
5927,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,3.0,5.0,"He's a good guy, but he expects students to be philosophers and understand every single thing. He teaches with metaphors and examples but tests are TOTALLY different."
5928,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,4.0,This class is amazing and interesting. The professor is a genius ! you will be involved with the topics and everything. Very knowledgeable class
5929,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI1020,1.0,5.0,"Dont take this professor. All class gets C. You wont learn anything. His tests are hard and have nothing to do with his lectures. Even if you study and attend all lectures , you still will never get A. He just uses difficult test banks for his finals. Look for another professor."
5930,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI010,5.0,4.0,TRIFF IS AMAZING.
5931,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,4.0,He likes to talk but if you listen you'll be fine
5932,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,1.0,5.0,If your not a big fan of philosophy than do not take him. He is a very tough grader and gets very personal. If you do not like reading then do not take him.
5933,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,4.0,Professor Triff teach very good anybody will love him but philosophy is a tough subject u have to put the work and use your mind
5934,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,4.0,Professor triff is a really good professor just read the material in order to understand as well as the homework. The tests are pretty tough but just read and study and you will be fine. He curved our test a lot which was very helpful but just study and youll pass this class.
5935,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"He was easily the best professor I had. For those who are interested in philosophy, you can feel the passion Professor Triff has for the subject and makes you want to work that much harder to understand. The book is essential, but he's a fair grader and is not looking to fail anyone. Definitely recommend."
5936,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,3.0,"Whether you're into philosophy or ethics, you will definitely love professor Triff. His lessons are amazing and you will learn a lot not only the book lessons but also life lessons. You will need the book since he gives book questions but also for his tests. He is very respectful, thoughtful and funny. Taking his class is a MUST!"
5937,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely love this class and I would take it again. His lectures were not only informative but also fun. You will need your textbook and he did give homework so you could follow next class lecture. He's a bit strange but harmless, he understands students and hardships so it's okay to talk to him. Also, VISIT HIM DURING HIS OFFICE HOURS!!!"
5938,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,2.0,"He does make the class fun. He's so strange I love it. Sometimes he says things that are outdated and it was fun challenging him about it. The discussions are really interesting. The first 2 tests are difficult because of the subject (logic and the mind) but the other 2 are easy. You will write a phi essay. Study, read and take notes."
5939,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,2.0,"I was not into phi, but this prof is cool. If you take your time to understand what he's tryna explain, you'll like it and you'll pass his class. I will not take this class again, cause I'm not into phi, but if you are, I truly recommend you triff."
5940,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"One of the most interesting, well-versed, and knowledgeable professors on any campus. His lectures are decisive, heavy, and intricate. You must pay attention to his class because these are concepts about thought experiments. Find out how relatable it is to your life and others. World class professor that I feel provides invaluable lessons."
5941,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,Hes an awesome Professor. He knows his stuff and keeps your attention with good lectures. His homework assignments and lectures prepares you for the test completely. He curves the grade. Theres one essay and 4 exams.
5942,226124,Alfredo,Perez-Triff,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,4.0,"The lecture was interesting at some points but then at others, I zoned out. If you are not really into learning about this particular field you most likely will be like me. The good thing is his grading system is off he sets it up so that you should be able to pass his class as long as you tried on the test and came to class."
5944,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor, super clear in grading and makes class fun."
5945,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Loved this teacher so much! I took him for Summer 2018 and the course was so short :( I wish I had him all year long, funnest class ever! He deserves so much love!!! The way he critiques is amazing, learned a lot from him and his experiences. He makes the lectures so funny and entertaining."
5946,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"prof. olsen is a fantastic teacher. he demonstrates how to do the first presentation youll have to do, and the rest youre given very clear instructions. good person, and gives honest and helpful feedback. the assignments along w his feedback will help you communicated better."
5947,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Olsen was incredible! He's an honest guy and gives you on point feedback. Had him for the summer. No textbook used. Tough grader, hard to get a perfect score, but very easy assignments and easy A. Great class! #SpeechGod"
5948,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,1.0,"Yet another amazing professor who actually cares about his students... sadly he is retiring soon he told our class. I recommend taking him ASAP. 1 individual presentation about yourself. 2 projects with a group. And no essays :D, the most he will ask is 3 questions but it needs to be 1 1/2 pages long. Very funny.. SPEEECH GODDDD"
5949,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,3.0,"His a one of a kind professor thats very rare to come by he actually cares and loves feed back from his students. His lectures are amazing ( inspirational, hilarious, and captivating) that you don't even realize class is over. It's easy you just do projects, group work, and its an easy A. ( SPEECH GOD!! )"
5950,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,This is a great class to be in especially with professor Olsen. He makes class a fun place and this is coming from a very shy person. If you need to take a speech class definitely take it with him. To pass the class all you have to do is just be prepared in your speeches and make sure you do the work.
5951,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"I dont know why people say hes a tough grader. I gave speeches that I barely prepared for and I still received As and Bs from him. As long as you do every speech and write the short essays he mandates youll be fine, its not that scary and this is coming from a SUPER shy person. Professor Olsen definitely makes class less intimidating."
5952,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,3.0,Awesome class. I was expecting a boring speech class but it turns out to be quite interesting. Now the class is easy to pass but kind of hard to get an A. He is not the kind of just say something and get the A. He can be tough when grading and takes 2 points away for any grammar mistake in the essays. If you are looking for an easy class reconsider
5953,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Olsen is a great professor, he's super funny and makes speaking less nerve-racking than you think. Once you put in effort to give a good speech and learn from mistakes, its not hard to pass the class. His class helped me feel more comfortable speaking in front of people. Whether you need this class for credit or not, I highly recommend taking it."
5954,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,1.0,"amazing professor, funny, understanding, and truly helps you with your speech, its a must to take, easy A, and enjoy the show!!!"
5955,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,1.0,"He's so funny. He was one of my first college professors and I chose him because of all the amazing reviews on this website. He definitely lived up to the hype. He's hilarious, never a boring moment in his class. MUST-TAKE!! He is the speech god. I am an SAS student and we all love his speech class. It's basically rite of passage to take his class."
5956,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,"Neil Olsen is actually the speech god, there is no one better! His class consists of a couple of solo speeches, a few group projects, some essays, and a mock interview. It really isn't a lot when it's spread out into a full semester. Olsen can make anyone a great speaker. He is pretty tough when it comes to grading but that pushes you to do better."
5957,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,4.0,2.0,"Speech God is a tough grader but you will have a lot of fun in his class, he has a way of keeping you in tune the whole class. you will have a hard time dozing off."
5958,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,1.0,"He is honestly very passionate about his job, very great professor."
5959,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,He is wonderful. TAKE HIM TAKE HIM TAKE HIM.
5960,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Behold the Speech god! If you are afraid of pubic speaking then this is the class you must take! Not only is the professor absolutely hilarious, he is an inspiration. The class consists of a couple of public speeches and a few group assignments that build team work! You must take his class!"
5961,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,1.0,"Professor Olsen is one of the best teachers that I've had. He makes an effort to make you feel comfortable in front of the class and literally everything is done in groups. Even if you have a fear of public speaking, this is a really simple class that can help you feel at ease in front of a crowd. Totally recommend."
5962,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"It was an honor to take speech with the speech god. The first day of classes he helped us feel comfortable. We only presented 3 speeches and had an interview process. Shockingly I enjoyed the class, because I dislike speaking in front of an audience. I've improved on that greatly in this class."
5963,776313,Neil,Olsen,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"SPEECH GOD!!  2 or 3 speeches that are SUPER easy, a group project, the interview project was fun. you get to miss almost a month of class during the interview project. his lectures are short, to the point. easy to follow. no exams. 1 midterm that is in groups. super funny and inspirational. I would definitely take again&amp; I'm terrified of speeches."
5965,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,4.0,3.0,"She is very impatient and does not like to repeat herself, but she genuinely cares about teaching her students and wants them all to succeed. Gives clear feedback on essays and assignments. Pay attention! Do not ask stupid questions because she will embarrass you and come off as extremely sarcastic and rude."
5966,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"She is super helpful when giving feedback on essays and wants you to do well.

5967,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"First of all, she is literally an angel.

You can see that she genuinely cares for us and will set us up for success. Best professor ever to have existed."
5968,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Yi is so sweet, she truly cares about your academic career.

Very friendly and understanding during pandemic.
5970,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,3.0,2.0,"First of all, Professor Yi is caring with her students and I am assuming that she is amazing in face-to-face teaching BUT she isn't strong online. There is no freedom when it comes to writing your papers and also she goes on about one specific topic for the whole semester. There's room for improvement since it was a sudden change to online teaching"
5971,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"Professor Yi is very caring, sweet, and understanding. She teaches you how to become a better writer. Also, she gives you handouts every week on what you guys will be doing in the class. She always revises your paper before you turn it in and tells you what you need to fix. Easy A just do your work!"
5972,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"She makes you work for your grade, but also is always there to help you through it. She was very clear and descriptive in her lessons, there was no way you could not understand something. She shows she cares about her students and them actually learning."

She made my first semester easy and I passed it with an A."
5975,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"She is an excellent professor. She goes through every step with you. At some points she lost her patience, but is completely understandable, we made her haha. During the Coronavirus transition she was very helpful. She used Zoom and Google Classroom, which in my opinion are much easier than Blackboard. She does what is best for her students :)"
5976,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"THE BEST PROFESSOR I EVER HAD ,explains everything in details,help you every step, LOVE HER ,take her is the best!"

5978,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,2.0,4.0,"This teacher, when you are going to give her an essay to review, reviews some things for you and after you fix it and finally deliver it for a note it takes more errors"
5979,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"This is the best English professor you could ever have in your life. She is very hardworking, and always tries to make sure that every single student follows the right path. RECOMMENDED 1000000%%%"

5981,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,4.0,4.0,"She was a great professor. She does give a lot of homework and its a tough grader. However, she will tell you exactly how she wants you to do your paper. If you follow instructions youll do great."
5982,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ECON1101,5.0,3.0,Shes very sweet and cares about her students. I would recommend taking her class as an intro to English to give you an idea of how its going to be. I highly recommend her class.
5983,394015,Nancy,Yi,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"She reminded me a lot of the people on dance moms, a little bit extra and quirky but besides that, the class is a cake walk, literally show up and do her assignments and put some effort into them and you will pass"

5986,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,I loved him! I thought he was great. This was my first time passing ENC1101. If you show interest in his class you will get a good grade!
5987,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,I think the professor Carlos Gonzalez is the best because he has passion for his work. He encourages the students to be focus with his effective class and overall has an incredible manner to teach.
5988,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,Open your mind
5989,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,1.0,3.0,In this class you'll do three things. The class went to the wow center a place for mentally challenged kids which is fine but many didn't want to be forced into it. We do yoga as well. It's fine. However trying to keep in contact with him isn't easy. He never answers. He'll also make you write about your personal experiences no matter what.
5990,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Gonzalez's class is an amazing experience. His class makes you step out of your comfort zone for the sake of writing, and I've never felt more confident as a writer than ever before. He's extremely kind and understanding; you must have him as a teacher. His course involves reading stories, writing responses, writing a few essays, and even yoga."
5991,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC101,2.0,2.0,"Sentimental &amp; liberal. Watched videos and wrote our opinions on it. Made us write an essay about ourselves. He told me I couldn't write something in my essay because 'his mom went thru something similar and that didn't work for her'. LITERALLY. Class is a joke. An easy class, but in my opinion, worst professor ever. Learned ZERO english."
5992,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"This class is an easy A when effort is put in. He is very zen and spiritual, be prepared to learn yoga and to write A LOT. He will have you purchase his book off amazon, it is a collection of his students essays. You will have many writing assignments but you have a fair amount time to turn them in. Would definitely recommend"
5993,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,This is probably one of the best english professors ill ever have. His class is so inspiring and he never fails to motivate you. Its fairly easy and the readings are interesting. Compared to the professors my friends had he is the best of bunch. Totally recommend him!
5994,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"There aren't a lot of papers or assignments given for his class, but you're kind of graded for attendance.

5995,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,Hes an amazing professor who cares VERY much for his students. He even hands out his personal phone number to students for any questions they might have outside of the classroom.
5996,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,2.0,3.0,"If you want to learn something you better look for another teacher, I passed the class with a lot of work, but I did not learn anything about English composition."
5997,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"This guy is a (10+). If you take his class you would have to work, but is super easy and you will learn a lot of interesting and useful things, is a very particular class. Expect to get out of your comfort zone, it will be worth it. Also you will get the opportunity to volunteer at the WOW center and see they amazing work."
5998,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"Taking his class has been a life-changing experience. Expect to volunteer at The WOW center. It will be an amazing experience from which you will learn a lot. His class is very particular, but I promise it will make a difference in your life."
5999,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! Took him for ENC1101 my first semester of college and he's absolutely amazing he is a very inspirational and very easy class to pass, only 3 essays the whole class and he grades off of completion. Very recommended! He also does yoga in class."
6000,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,I am not a fan of the whole hippie yoga aesthetic but he's cool. The class is easy a few essays and a lot of sharing. It felt kind of like therapy.
6001,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101AND2,5.0,2.0,"Honestly surprised his rating isn't a 5.0. This class is life changing, you have to do your work. But if you don't get an A its on you."
6002,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,4.0,2.0,"Good professor, doesn't really teach English basics. There were three essays the whole semester. Very good class for a first time college student. He always tries to make the class interesting. I wish I can take him again!"
6003,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,4.0,2.0,"He is one of the most laid-back professors I have ever had the chance meeting. He makes the class so easy going and emphasizes how he doesn't like to make it stressful on the students, especially if its one of your first college classes. TAKE HIS CLASS! YOU WILL DEFINITELY NOT REGRET IT!"
6004,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,4.0,3.0,Very nice guy and understanding but will can see through BS so dont try. His teaching style was good in my opinion. he easily captures the class' attention. His class is nice sometimes because he teaches life lessons then connects it to english. Great class to learn more about yourself.
6005,405695,Carlos,Gonzalez,Miami Dade College (all),English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,Open minded
6007,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,2.0,"My favorite professor this semester. Yes, the workload can get a bit overwhelming but as long as you time manage it is nothing out of the ordinary. His lectures are amazing and very insightful. He is open to any questions and will make sure to explain until you understand. Really good sense of humor and always wishing the best. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!!!"
6008,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,1.0,4.0,he teaches u how to handle Life stress but actually just adds on to the stress . expect 5+ assignments a week. Dont take if you have other hard classes. dreaded his class. Prepare for tough nights
6009,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,2.0,His class is very straight forward and attendance is mandatory. You will definitely need your textbook; you will read in his class!
6010,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP2140,3.0,5.0,"Hes caring, not an easy class. His study guides are super long and just filled with questions. He lectures really fast and I felt very overwhelmed in class even though it was a full term class. I felt like he should have taken more of his time going over the chapters instead of trying to cover everything. Dont take if you have other hard classes"
6011,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,2.0,"Amazing psychology professor, he values his students and the subject very highly and has interesting lectures and class activities. Read the textbook, follow the syllabus, and show up to class every day to easily pass, you will be guaranteed to learn something transformative once you leave. Would instantly take him again in a heartbeat."
6012,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP2140,5.0,2.0,"He is awesome! This is my second time taking him and I couldn't love him more. He's super chill, hilarious, gives a bunch of opportunities for volunteering and internships, and his class is super easy. As long as you pay half attention to what he's saying and do the study guides, you'll pass no problem."
6013,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP2140,3.0,4.0,"He is a very good professor, but if you don't pay attention and take notes, you won't pass. He's study guides are long and the more information you put on it, the more likely you'll pass."
6014,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1106,5.0,2.0,"Extremely easy, but if you want to actually learn cool stuff dont take his class. (Hes interesting but stays by the book which isnt in my opinion)"

6017,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,2.0,has a slight accent but you barely could tell he is very good and will help you pass no matter what he also gives an optional final
6018,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,SOP2002,3.0,5.0,"For a class that's pretty low, in terms of the code; he makes it extremely hard. His 4 tests are confusing. Questions &amp; answer choices are phrased very badly. I studied and still never got an A on tests. Lectures somewhat boring. Good amount of extra credit. Miss class more than 4x, get dropped. Don't take both his CLP2140 and SOP2002 together ����"
6019,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP2140,3.0,4.0,"Class is very interesting. Has 4 tests, gives study guides (somewhat help). To Ace test, must read book and powerpoints to fill in study guide. Has a group project that extends all semester, collects in parts every 2 weeks. Final group presentation &amp; paper at the end. Miss class multiple times, get dropped. Must put in work for an A in the class."
6020,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,4.0,1.0,Great teacher loves what he does.
6021,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,SOP2002,3.0,5.0,I chose this professor because a friend of mine said she took him for CLP and was super easy and nice. He is a very kind man but his tests are extremely hard for no reason. Social Psychology should have been an easy class but his tests really messed with everyone. In the tests he tries to trick you by putting 2 choices with the same meaning.
6022,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP2140,5.0,3.0,It was an amazing class. I loved the videos and class discussions. He gives case studies that are very helpful and will make your life easier. The group project was great.

6024,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,3.0,He gives short quizzes before lecture to help you focus on info you need to know for the tests. Many opportunities to improve your grade doing some work on class.

6026,687926,Jose,Guntin,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,1.0,3.0,"LITERALLY teaches the lesson after the quiz. quiz every week , no hw , service learning required (10 hours) and 4 exams that are nothing like the quiz. don't buy the book, you have access of the powerpoint. attendance is mandatory after 4 absences he will drop you !!!!"
6028,1457000,Richard,Tapia,Miami Dade College (all),Political Science,POS2041,5.0,1.0,He is a great professor and easy to pass.

Read the material before coming to class so that you use the class as a review. He's so funny and gives you opportunities to earn a high grade! I had him for Lab 2086 as well and also got an A. Hands down the best AP prof.
6114,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085L,4.0,3.0,"At first, Bidot can come off as harsh, but you quickly learn that he will only get on your case if you repeatedly show lack of interest. I took his lab and learned more in his lab than I did in lecture w/a different professor. He makes corny jokes throughout to help you remember the material, and he starts each class with a summary on the board."
6115,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085L,5.0,3.0,"I loved having Professor Bidot for my lab. He is a very good teacher that actually cares for his students. Tests were always based on PowerPoints so no need for extra studying. Also he is funny which can make the class more enjoyable. If you pay attention, you will excel for sure. I learned so much from this lab and I would take it again."
6116,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085L,5.0,3.0,He's a great professor. If you pay attention and interactive with the class you will pass
6117,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085L,4.0,2.0,"Professor Bidot is very concern about our learning process, he is always willing to help us if we have any question, always motivates us to participate in class. He uses learning strategies to keep us alert in class, he also has a good sense of humor. I would really take him for my next class."
6118,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085L,5.0,3.0,Highly recommend Dr. Bidot. Hes a very kind professor with many years of experience in the field and classroom. His labs are entertaining. Hes very caring. Great teacher. He takes good notes on the board so take pictures of that and all the body part models because those will be on the practicums. Participate in class. Multiple quizzes in class.
6119,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085L,1.0,4.0,He's on my top worst professors list. He yells at you in class and is very disrespectful in general. He is constantly raising his voice and he really doesn't know what he is talking about. Tough grader but if he likes you then you'll do ok. You never really know where you stand in lab. Very unorganized. I'd never ever take a class with this guy.
6120,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,4.0,3.0,"Tests are solely based on power points - no need for the textbook. His lectures are interesting b/c he is a funny man. If you don't pass, this class its b/c you didn't care to learn the material on the power points he provides. A few tests, hw (xtra credit) and a group project (really easy). I did the bare minimum &amp; got an A - just do your part."
6121,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2086,5.0,3.0,"Professor Bidot is amazing! He cares about the students and what you are learning, he also uses little anecdotes that make you remember the material. He gives HW for extra credit to help you with exams, but don't miss class because he tells you during lecture what the different extra credits will be."
6122,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC20862086L,5.0,5.0,"This professor is excellent, his grading method allow you to improved your grade although you didn't start with good grade in your first test. He give study guides and his Power points presentations, that help a lot. Quiz before each regular test but this help you to be prepare for the tests. Take care of his students, and is inspirational."
6123,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,Great professor! Anatomy is hard but he make this class easy. He is inspirational and support his students with his PPPs and study guides. But of course you have to study
6124,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,1.0,5.0,"Do Not take him. He does not teach , do your self a favor and find someone else!!!"
6125,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,2.0,5.0,"I'm really surprised at the good reviews for him. I consider myself a really serious student, who puts in the time and I found the class unnecessarily hard. I have several friends that took A&amp;P with other professors and they didn't struggle as much because their professors actually taught the material and paced it out. Very disappointed."
6126,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,2.0,4.0,"Easy A if ur already in medical field. MUST read book to grasp information well enough to do well in tests, powerpoints are NOT enough. His lectures are boring , not ""funny"" &amp; he doesn't delve into the material. Asking for clarification was useless. Gives plenty of opportunities cause it would be impossible to pass otherwise. HW is NOT extra credit"
6127,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC208586,5.0,4.0,Good/funny professor! Hes passionate about his students and anatomy. He is very straight forward. Reads from PowerPoint. Everything in PowerPoint will be on quiz and test. 5 quiz 5 test 1 group project. You have to work for it. Dont take him if youre sensitive!
6128,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,5.0,3.0,"I love Professor Bidot! Honestly, this is an Anatomy class and is not supposed to be easy. You are required to study and if you dont you probably wont do well, but that goes with just about any other class. Professor Bidot is really funny and makes the lectures interesting, I was able to remember a lot of the terminology because of his jokes."
6129,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,1.0,5.0,"Awful. No real teaching, just glosses over the material so you have to teach urself with the book. Unorganized. Accent gets in the way of understanding terminology, often pronounces the names wrong, which causes confusion. 5 tests &amp; final, 6 quizzes, research paper. No point to attend class other than to get credit. I regret taking him 100%"
6130,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,BSC2085,1.0,5.0,"5 tests plus a final; drops lowest test. 6 quizzes; drops lowest. homework is extra credit, 6 page research paper, attendance counts. He may be an MD but he does not know how to teach, reads off PowerPoint. Gets defensive if you question him. Says tests are based off PowerPoint but thats a lie, you need to read the chapters in order to do well."
6131,957305,Carlos,Bidot,Miami Dade College (all),Science,ANAT2086,5.0,4.0,I really enjoyed the class. Its not very often that an instructor can make a subject come alive the way he does. He is an older instructor but you often forget this when you hear him explaining concepts with passion or curiosity. This made it much easier to get through some of the more boring chapters. You can tell he cares about students education
6133,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,4.0,Overall this expeience with him was not the best. We have about 100-200 homework questions to complete every other week and they're only worth 10% of our grade. Dont get me wrong he knows the material he is teaching but i would not recommend this class. I'm currently failing because i scored 35% on the first test despite doing all of the homework!
6134,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,2.0,4.0,"I wouldnt take again. Hes a good prof but very rude. I missed 3 exams because he refused to help us work lockdown browser claiming he went over it. I was a new transfer to his class and genuinely didnt know! Then he said if we didnt care, why should he. He uses xyz homework so expect a huge amount of hw and proctored exams weekly!"
6135,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,GEB1011,5.0,2.0,"If I could take Professor Montanez again I would. There is a lot to read, but it's not hard. Just follow the syllabus, do the midterm and assignments and you will be good."
6136,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,GEB1011,3.0,3.0,Super generic online course. This instructor was more of a course monitor and didn't actually teach anything - the assignments were all purchased from Cengage. He was friendly enough but I literally never engaged with him. Not once. Since it's a self-taught class you really make of it what you want.
6137,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"This professor is super caring and heartwarming but stays professional throughout. He can be goofy at times to lighten up the room, but he's always serious about his work. He knows his stuff and is great at explaining things step by step. As long as you speak up, he's always there for you to help! Definitely recommend him!!"
6138,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,4.0,"He is a nice professor and he really wants his students to pass, however, he is FAST with his lectures. There are 4 tests and a Final and because of COVID19, class moved online. It made the class easier but still hard. If you like how your grade is in the end, then you didnt need to do the final (It saved me). Overall, I recommend another professor"
6139,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"He is the sweetest prof ever! He is accessible, approachable, and easy-going. As long as you take notes and copy down each example he writes down then you will ace the test. The tests are exactly like problems in class , just different numbers. There was one group project in the end, but it's very easy and he walks you through it. RECOMMEND!!! (:"
6140,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,3.0,"When it came to the discussion boards, he was a very tough grader. His tests are pretty difficult. Be ready for A LOT of hw. I will say, he was EXTREMELY unfair when it came to the pandemic. Some of my classmates could not get an appointment for proctor U and the response was ""Sorry retake the class in June"" without coming up with an alternative."
6141,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,3.0,"Due to this pandemic I have a lost a close family member and I emailed him over not having the right equipment to take the exam and how I could not leave the house due to not wanting risk of catching anything bc of my dad also having cancer and he just forwarded me an email. FINAL AND MIDTERM IS PROCTORED, Im not in a mental state of mind for it"
6142,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,4.0,This professor at first was very nice but as soon as the schools closed and we switched to online learning he became very unreasonable. All he cared about was the final being proctored. No exceptions! If there are no time slots available for proctor U forget it. He will end your semester with an incomplete and you would need to retake in June!
6143,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"Please do not take him online!! He makes your mid and final 60% OF YOUR GRADE! I went from an A to an F because I failed the midterm so I had to drop the class even though the semester is close to being over. Also, he gives a lot of hw. Each module has about 30-40 very hard questions and there's about 8 of them you have to finish in a month."
6144,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,Hes the nicest professor and is good lecturer but he sometimes skips steps he assumes you know. His tests are extremely hard and his grading criteria is horrible. Is you miss one question its already a B. No one has ever gotten 100 on a test and the class avr was D. The final did not cover the past tests. I went to tutoring everyday still failed.
6145,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,5.0,hes so nice its hard not to like . hes sometimes clear but he expects you to understand what hes doing when its the first time he does it and skips steps without explaining assuming you know. only gives you a minute to solve hard problems and tests are extremely hard and he deducts points for everything so getting a good grade is almost impossible.
6146,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MATH1030,5.0,2.0,He explains things really well and is willing to sit and take extra time to make sure everyone understands. Don't need the textbook but need MyMathLab on Pearson. You have unlimited tries on homework questions so as long as you do it it's near impossible to do poorly! Tests are really easy too
6147,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,5.0,He is one of the nicest professors Ive had and is great with lectures very straight forward and easy to understand but his tests are very hard. I did all the online homework and studied with a tutor and still only got a c. His tests are 10 x harder than the lecture.
6148,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"I took Mr. Montanez for MAC1033 and MAC1105. He's amazing with his lectures, makes it clear for everybody to understand if not he gives great examples to make it easier. There's online homework that is useful to add up to your points if you mess up on a test. Final replaces lowest grade, tests are straight forward from all the lectures. Take notes"
6149,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Were it not for him teaching I doubt I would pass the class. The material itself is a lot, however, the way he teaches makes it really easy to understand. He cuts out all of the fat from the textbook and focuses on what actually matters."
6150,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,4.0,"He probably the best math teacher I ever had. Ask him question ;hell always answers or will give another example , so everyone can understand. Remainder missing class would probably be bad for u ,but thats true of every math class."
6151,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,GEB1011,5.0,2.0,"I took GEB1011 mini term with him. He keeps you updated weekly throughout the whole class. You do have a proctored midterm which is 15% of your grade, everything else is online and a couple of essays to write which are easy to do and only one counts towards your grade. He also drops the lowest score. Take him online if you need this class."
6152,461754,Miguel,Montanez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT0028,5.0,3.0,I am glad to have Mr. Montanez for my math courses! He is very organized and is sure that everyone understands the work! The work is easy and I couldnt have passed without him! I would definitely recommend Mr. Montanez
6154,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,One of the best. I have to drop the class because of personal reasons but she really tried to help. When after me when I wasn't logging in or after the first test which I failed. So caring. Most teachers don't try this hard. I am going to take her again next semester.
6155,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,This lady really tries to work with you. She even helped me when I didn't have money for the book. Really a good and caring teacher.
6156,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,4.0,4.0,One of the best at Dade. I wish I could take more nutrition classes with her. She is a dietitian so she brings a lot of experience to the class. Very passionate about the subject and truly cares for her students.
6157,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,4.0,3.0,"A good experience. I took her this summer. I had problems and she helped. Very flexible and the course was great. I liked the blogs the most. There is also post test, module tests and a proctored midterm. No projects and no final. She drops the lowest module test from 5. I would take her again."
6158,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,3.0,"Remote classes are hard but with COVID19, no other choice. I love it. She engaged the students by asking question and answer all of our questions. She is caring, noticing if someone needed extra help and going after those who miss assignments/tests. Great. Take her!"
6159,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,"Everything was clear from day 1, very organized and helpful. Responded to email quick, lots of opportunities to get a good grade. Another thing, the course is pretty and things easy to find. This was an online class."
6160,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUM1201,5.0,4.0,Prof. P genuinely knows what shes talking about and wants to help students apply the knowledge she bestows upon them. The hardest part of her class is the nutritional analysis and memorizing information about different minerals and vitamins. There is some simple online course work and reading. Her class was challenging but passable &amp; beneficial.
6161,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUM1201,3.0,3.0,"She was nice but I felt like I was back in middle school with her rules and paper handouts. However, she obviously knows her stuff and is always helpful when you have a question."
6162,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,4.0,3.0,"This nutrition class requires a lot of reading to understand the material. There is only a midterm for this class with no study guide, so studying the material is essential. Other than that, this class was very easy to go through. The professor is so nice and always communicates with her students. I would definitely take her again."
6163,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUM1201,1.0,4.0,"Prof Polanco knows her stuff very well, she is brilliant. However, she finds pride in letting her students know that she is superior, which is not a nice trait for a professor. She is willing to teach and help, but will give you inconclusive answers. Take her if you are willing to be graded unfairly."
6164,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,"So caring and interested in the success of her students and changing our eating habits. I learned so much that I can use in my real life. I am sorry MDC only offers this nutrition class. I want to learn them with her. I appreciate that she ask her students for feedback, she cares what we think and wants to help us. Take her."
6165,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,3.0,4.0,"This professor is brilliant and she knows her stuff however, when you ask questions she makes you feel small. She over exaggerates A lot. However, her class is not bad at all."
6166,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,"I think some of the negative comments are unfair. The topic is not easy but she makes it interesting. Passionate for the class, her students and very caring. Don't think about it, take her. She is the best."
6167,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUM1201,5.0,4.0,"I was wowed. Caring, available. If you mess up she goes after you. She cares about you as a person. She is tough. Takes her class and her students serious. I learned so much and stuff that I can you to better myself. Constantly sending remainders via Blackboard and in class. If you failed you didn't try. The best."
6168,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,4.0,4.0,Professor Polanco is caring. She gives you very good detailed feedback and if you actually put the effort and reach out to her she will definitely help you. It is not an easy course in general but if you are having a rough time reach out to her and she will help you. I personally liked her a lot and enjoyed her course as well as her feedback
6169,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,3.0,4.0,this professor was nice but the workload was a bit much. if you do not need this course do not take it. she was a very tough grader and intimidating.
6170,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,The best. It truly prepared me for my clinical rounds. Great questions in class and exams that make you think and prepares you. Always available to help and encourage you not to ever quit.
6171,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUM1201,5.0,3.0,One of the best. Caring but tough. She reaches out to the students who need help. Very observant and on top of her students. Full of information. Loves to make you think about the material. I wish there were more nutrition classes. I take her again. MIss the class already.
6172,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,"This professor is probably one that I will think about for the rest of my life. I have thoroughly enjoyed her classes as each lecture was very interesting. Everyone should take nutrition because there is so much misinformation out there. She is tough, but I think that toughness is needed for you to really understand the material."
6173,1390100,Rosa,Polanco-Paula,Miami Dade College (all),Science,HUN1201,5.0,4.0,"She is great. I learned every day I was in class. She really makes you think about the material and how it affects you, your family and the world. I wish there were more nutrition classes to take with her."
6175,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,"She gave an extreme amount of online homework. She reduced it but it was still pretty hard. I am thankful that she cared enough to reduce it and understood our problems. Then the tests were moderately hard. She goes over the review for tests, in which, I loved the most about her."
6176,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,3.0,6 Test (20 questions) worth 35% percent of grade mid term ( 20 questions  yes its really only 20 questions) worth 25% of grade Final exam (20-25 questions ) worth 35% Complete 5 out of 8 discussion boards worth 5% Homework(47 assignments)  worth 10% of grade. dont hesitate to take her this is from a student who hates math and barley understands
6177,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"As someone that has really hard time with math, I could not wish for a better professor than her. She made the statistics look easy and there was no way you wouldn't understand it if you pay attention in the class. She is very kind, sweet, and accessible outside the class. There are 4 tests, one group project, and online homework. Would take again!"
6178,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,This teacher is horrible. She is a mess and out of order. Shes never prepared when class begins and starts late. Tries to make up for it by talking when the class should be over. She confuses formulas and is honestly just confusing. She answers your question with a question.
6179,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,I took her stats class over the summer in 6 weeks and it was a breeze. She makes it really easy to understand and learn. Her tests have no surprises and all homework is online. Would HIGHLY recommend
6180,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,Shes one of the sweetest professors ever and she makes stats soo easy. She gives extra credit opportunities for every exam and the homework is all online. The final is a group project but its pretty easy. I would definitely suggest taking her!
6181,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Great math teacher, makes statistics seem easy. Super caring and funny, 4 exams and a lot of homework, it isn't hard, just takes up your time. Lectures are clear and easy to keep up with, all of her notes are online so you won't fall behind. There's a group project but she guides you along the way and it's super easy. Highly recommend."
6182,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,LIBMATH,2.0,5.0,"TOOK IT ONLINE and never answers to their students, youll get lost and the organization its a mess because you dont know exactly the due dates. Let me warn you!!"
6183,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"Professor Alvarez is honestly the worst professor I have ever had. I took her class online and it was impossible to get a hold of her. No extra credit available and not caring at all when it came to the grades. I definitely do not recommend her, she has no empathy towards her students. Not flexible at all! Good luck with her!"
6184,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,5.0,Skip class and you wont pass because youll be lost. Stats requires lots of study time and good time management. If you cant give this class time then dont take it...i suffered for taking many difficult classes at once. Did not get my ideal grade. If all you need to do is pass by any means necessary then this is your professor! She teaches well
6185,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,4.0,"Makes sure her students understand the lecture and she is super accessible outside of class. She gives extra credit and gives test reviews so take all the opportunities she gives you, it makes a difference. Pay attention to the lectures because everything she goes over is on the test. Overall, she's really great. I don't like math but I got an A."
6186,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,2.0,"Clear lectures. Grades based on 4 tests, an optional final, and homework (10%). Homework was easy enough especially after her lectures. Didn't test her attendance policy but I sat near the middle scrolling through twitter every class and she didnt seem to mind."
6187,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,4.0,"This class was hard for me, and the professor did not help at all. There was no way I could understand her classes. Tried it with her videos and same thing. I was only able to understand the book. I took this class blended, maybe it would have been better if I didn't. She gives a lot of extra credit opportunities so take advantage of them."
6188,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,"Great professor! Very caring and sweet, genuinely cares about her students. Lectures are clear when she explains it but her notes arent easy to understand without her explaining so going to class is a must. Easily accessible outside of class and lets you take tests ahead of time if needed. Very flexible. Would take again!!!"
6189,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,4.0,"Attendance is not mandatory, but if you don't show up consistently, good luck. She's kind, and actually goes out of her way to teach, and that's a rarity that should be appreciated."
6190,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,4.0,"Prof Alvarez is a great professor! She truly teaches the lessons as they are and her reviews mock the test. Make sure you dont fall behind on the homework though because she grades it all on the last week of the semester so if you leave it till the end you most likely wont do it. Also, dont recommend taking it blended (half online)."
6191,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA1023,5.0,3.0,"Ive taken Professor Alvarez twice now. Shes a great professor. The textbook does a pretty good job explaining itself, but she also is great at helping you out if youre stuck. Theres a lot of online homeworks assignment but theyre very helpful. Her test reviews are extremely similar to her test. Just keep up and youre good."
6192,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,2.0,"Im not good at statistics, but professor Alvarez made it easy to learn. She explains everything well in her lectures and her exams (4) are just like the study guide! All the homework is due the last day of class so dont slack. She also gives easy extra credit in class for participation!!"
6193,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,Maria Alvarez is the best math teacher I've ever had! Study the reviews for the tests and do the MyStatLab homework and you will pass. She gives a lot of extra credit for in-class reviews that she does before the tests so make sure you show up for those. Very caring and funny LOVED her class.
6194,201531,Maria,Alvarez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,1.0,Professor Alvarez is the best stats professor at Miami Dade. Her grading criteria is very clear. 90% 4 tests (and optional final that replaces your lowest grade) and 10% homework thats due at the end of the semester. HER REVIEW IS EXACTLY LIKE HER TESTS. she gives extra credit. she is caring. like come on it doesn't get easier than this.
6196,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,1.0,4.0,"I took this class online because of COVID-19, he doesn't leave any videos for the students to review, you have to study it on your own (with his low quality book) , the quizzes are 10 questions, 10 min, so you're rushing every question, he doesn't allow you to view which questions you got right or wrong. If you really want to learn, DON'T pick him."
6197,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,1.0,2.0,"I won't lie this class is super easy, just read the lectures and you will pass, but the profesor is the worst I ever had. First of all we have to buy his own book that is the most boring book that I had ever read on my life. He does do anything, you have teach yourself. Also is rude answering email and if you have a complaint he doesn't answer back"
6198,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2064,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This professor is not it. His class was suppose to be in person but due to Covid-19, I am stuck with this professor online. I have to say he is not teaching at all. If you are good at teaching yourself then this course is for you. But if you need an actual professor who teaches then the COURSE ( atm ) Is not for you."
6199,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI1100,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This professor is HORRIBLE. His class was suppose to be in person but due to Covid-19, I am stuck with this professor online. I have to say he is not teaching at all. If you are good at teaching yourself then this course is for you. But if you need an actual professor who teaches then THIS COURSE ( atm ) Is not for you."
6200,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PSY1100,5.0,3.0,"He is a pretty good professor. He tends to talk quite a bit and tries very hard to get you to see his point of view, however, he makes the textbook and it is free. The extra credit is slightly questionable, but it makes you think. He cares very much for his students and you can go to him for homework help and he will provide. A good choice."
6201,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,1.0,4.0,Liberal that trys to make you go vegan and forces his political views on you. Steer away.
6202,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,1.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! If you by any chance happen to disagree with his political beliefs he will purposely give you a worse grade. He likes to push his political views on his students and ridicule others for having a different belief. Dont take this class. You have been warned. Good luck
6203,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,3.0,"Professor Fink in my opinion is an amazing and knowledgeable professor. I thought this class was going to be boring, but it actually got my attention. This class helped me seeing life from a different perspective. The assignments were interesting and from a book he wrote himself. I recommend taking Professor Fink."
6204,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,3.0,"Hes very kind and always tries to engage with his students, the material can sometimes be  little boring but overall a fairly easy class. You do have to buy his book and study off of that for the tests, he requires 3 essays their literally 250 words, easiest assignment ever! He was chill and always told jokes, he was fun teacher to have."
6205,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,4.0,"I had a great time in his class. My grades weren't GREAT, its a hard class, but I loved how down-to-earth he is. Hes funny and witty. I was confused most of the class because it's all about morality - it makes you examine your beliefs- but in the end, I actually enjoyed it. He gives extra credit and 3 short essay assignments and 3 tests. 9/10"
6206,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,2.0,"Great lecturer, sometimes the material is a biiiiit dry, however a lot of the time he can capture your attention pretty well with a good class debate. No textbook. Just a small little book he made himself. Easy material, and easy tests."
6207,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,2.0,"He's certainly a wacky guy, to say the least, but it's precisely this that made his class so fun. He's always cracking jokes and even makes inside jokes with the class that he uses to make lectures more interesting (ex: RAUL!! (if ya know, ya know)). Just take notes during class and read the tiny chapters he assigns, and you'll pass for sure."
6208,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,2.0,"Very interesting dude. Class is graded by few things so make sure to study for the exams. Other than that it is a breeze. Lectures can sometimes get really boring, just depends what you're interested in."
6209,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,3.0,"Professor Fink is a really good teacher, the class will be interesting and really gets you thinking. Great writing assignments, fair test(all in study guide). Would definately take him again."
6210,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2064,5.0,2.0,"Good professor, interesting class"
6211,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI1100,4.0,3.0,This class is really easy but tbh his class can get really boring fast
6212,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,3.0,4.0,"He's a really nice person but his lectures are extremely boring and there are barely any assignments so if you do bad on 1 assignment then you're kinda screwed. His reviews are nothing like the tests, I learned the hard way."
6213,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2064,2.0,4.0,Tries to make you go vegan. Gets upset when you dont understand one of the difficult arguments he explains. I wouldnt take him again.
6214,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2064,5.0,2.0,Amazing prof! I do not regret taking him and he is one of the best professor I've ever had. I really liked his class and he makes everything interesting!
6215,305605,Charles,Fink,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,4.0,2.0,"This teacher is super nice and caring. He is clear lectures, he talks a good amount but you still get interested in the topics of the course. Definitely would take him again."
6217,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,1.0,"Horrible professor. He's very smart but doesn't know how to teach. If you aren't good at math don't take him. He gives a lot of homework, over 40 questions per section. HW only added to test up to 10 extra points. His test are nothing like the homework, they are heavy &amp;he will not give a review packet."
6218,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,5.0,"He was very disrespectful, he screamed at me for no reason at all, and failed me after screaming at me! I dont recommend this Profesor at all, please choose wisely."
6219,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,3.0,I admit that I was struggling at first because I wasn't doing my homework and I was slacking off and also having personal issues in my life. I spoke to him about it and he helped me go over questions I was confused about. Gave me a chance to make up work.
6220,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,All the homeworks in the book there are at least 100 questions in each chapter to do and most of the questions he didn't go over during lecture. He is lecturing one minute and next telling jokes going way off topic. The homework is not graded only put as points toward tests which depends if you do it online or paper. Don't take if less than decent
6221,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,5.0,"Horrible professor. Doesnt know how to teach. If you arent good at math dont take him. He gives a lot of homework. He teaches way to fast, doesnt like to answer your questions. His test are nothing like the homework, they are heavy and he doesnt even give a review packet. DONT TAKE HIS CLASS"
6222,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,Tbh this has to be the worst teacher Ive EVER had. Its a shame because he seems like such a sweet guy but Im not paying hundreds of dollars just for a professor to be sweet. I don't recommend. Especially if youre NOT good at math already. The only way youll actually do good is if youre already good at math otherwise dont waste your time.
6223,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,3.0,"He is a great teacher. The material is not hard and his lectures are very helpful. There are so many opportunities to do well on the exam. If you do your homework, you will get extra points on your exam. If you need help, see him after class and he will help you. Overall good teacher!"
6224,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"This professor is a complete and utter mess, he doesn't know how to teach, goes off topic and says random things. He is a terrible grader, whatever you do, do not take him. He does work and doesn't know how to explain ANYTHING, he had another professor come in and teach the class because he didn't know how to teach the material. Don't take him."
6225,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"Will never take him again, he goes so fast its hard to keep up and not easy when you ask questions, he is a though grader over all."
6226,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,4.0,"This has been the worse professor Ive ever had. Hes very messy, hard to understand, thinks hes smarter then you, and isnt helpful. Dont take him if your not very good at math. Hes not the right professor that would help you to understand or explain."
6227,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,5.0,His teaching style is messy and very disorganized.
6228,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,3.0,"One of the most underrated professors in my opinion. Hw is optional, online hw is +10 on the exam and book hw can give you anywhere from +4-8! He is funny and super nice, and if you visit during office hours he will help with any questions you have. His class has 5 exams and a final that will replace your lowest grade. Really happy I picked him!"
6229,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,ive only had him for like 2 classes and all i gotta say if you are okay with a messy style of math and boring lectures this is not your guy he also says he wants you to show the right work for each problem for homeworks and tests or he will mark it wrong
6230,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,3.0,"His teaching style is messy, but he explains everything very well. He'll help you without any problems if you ask. Textbook is required or you can buy the online code. Take notes and do the homework. Final is optional if you're doing well in the class."
6231,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,4.0,"MOST unorganized professor. If you can learn college algebra in the messiest way, this class is for you."
6232,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,2.0,5.0,Horrible. Very disorganized and doesnt like answering questions of any kind. Makes fun of students and is not very nice. Cant really understand his way of teaching. I gave up on the class...
6233,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,4.0,"He is not understanding at all if there is a personal issue. He does explain material. His test are written &amp; you have to show work the way he wants if not it will be marked wrong, regardless if you got the answer correct. MUST buy textbook, if you do the 2week free trial it will not count. There are 4 test and many homework assignments. Good luck."
6234,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,Final grade  4 exams and an optional final. Homework is not mandatory/graded. 10 points added to your test grade if the HW is turned in and at least 90% correct. Lectures are boring but effective. Lots of examples. He's very understanding. You can be late to class no ques asked. Will need textbook or access code for hw. All in all very nice guy.
6235,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,1.0,4.0,"Lectures were back and forth, very disorganized for students who have a hard time with math. When he answers questions he is either sarcastic or very confusing to understand. About half of my class dropped the class by the middle of the semester. Did not answer any of my emails. The class itself was not that hard as long as you study on your own."
6236,750559,Robert,Griffiths,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,4.0,This guy is annoying. Dont take his class if you did not take MAT1033 He is horrible really bad at teaching. Too ecstatic and just boosts through lectures. Also VERY disorganized.
6238,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,AP2085,2.0,4.0,"I took this professor based off of previous positive ratings from other students. Even though this is a lecture class, Prof. Coro is not have any lectures (not even recorded ones) to teach the class, instead he makes his own PowerPoints between 40 to 60 slides to study on your own time. Also he expects you to take 7 exams without notes lol."
6239,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,"Professor Coro is amazing. I was doing well in his class, but I struggled a little at the of the semester since we changed to online mode of instruction due to the Covid 19, and he was always there to help me when I need it. He is super kind, and an excellent person. You will definitely learn in his class!!"
6240,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2086,5.0,4.0,"Professor Coro is really good at Anatomy. His tests are not easy but he will give you an opportunity for extra credit if needed. Lectures are heavy and communication is unilateral. However, if you study hard as you are suppossed to for any Anatomy class, you will get an A."
6241,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BCS2085,2.0,3.0,"Prepare to write 4 pages per class (which is not bad), bad if at any given moment he catches you looking at any other place other than his face, he will stop the class and spent 4 minutes explaining you why you should leave, even if you were looking at your notebook."
6242,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC20852086,5.0,4.0,"Coro is a respectable professor that cares about what and how students learn. His lectures are intense but you will learn absolutely everything you need ""for your future medical professions"". He is funny and does not mind explaining things many times for you to understand the material. He is a true gem. Definitely recommend him to everyone!"
6243,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,1.0,5.0,"If you're the type of student that can't learn and soak up information by just power points DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. During class, he only works off them, writes on the board and he contradicts the textbooks in some lessons. Get ready to write 4 pages of notes. He doesn't give out so much work so you have to pass all the test to pass the class."
6244,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BCS2085,4.0,3.0,Coro is refreshing and I like his old school teaching style. He wants you to know the material and be the best you can be for your professional future. His tests aren't easy but you have to stay on top of studying on your own. This is college after all! He gives you all the powerpoint info you need and notes in class is all you need for the tests.
6245,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,3.0,4.0,"Anatomy is a tough subject to begin with, no matter which professor you take, you will need to study hard. You need to be prepared for class in order to understand the physiology which is what he normally teaches. Get ready to study at least two weeks prior to your test. I looked at a lot of YouTube videos to help me understand the material. Hard"
6246,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,"Coro is an amazing professor, he devotes all of the class time to teaching you the material, no time to mess around! He writes and draws on the board which helps you understand the material. Study HARD for the tests and you will do great. Don't slack off or else you won't pass his tests. Both of the homeworks can be found on quizlet as well."
6247,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2086,5.0,5.0,"Professor Coro really loves teaching, his lectures are very long and each class have a lot of information but if you pay attention and study frequently you will be able to pass the class. The way I see it is that he is not only teaching you to pass the class but for you future career!!!!"
6248,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2086,1.0,5.0,"professor Coro is one of the worse professor that I ever have. His class are boring, the way he teach by drawing in the board make everything harder. you can not study from other sources bc he said all the time that he dont agree with what the book said and he explain diferent way. get ready to write 3 to 4 board in each class. dont take him"
6249,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BCS2085,1.0,5.0,"If you're going to take BCS 2085 with this professor, you are going to have to study a lot. I recommend that you read the PowerPoints he provides before each lecture otherwise you'll be lost. You must pay full attention and if you can, record everything he says because he talks a lot. Be prepared for the exams because they are very difficult."
6250,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BCS2085,1.0,5.0,This is the hardest class Ive ever taken. The professor has an extensive knowledge of physiology but his teaching method is not the most efficient. He talks too much and the examples he gives on the board are very hard to understand. There are no study guides or reviews for the tests so you have to pray that you studied the correct content.
6251,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,5.0,3.0,"This professor is a genius! He is an awesome professor who really wants you to learn. His lectures are heavy but he provides powerpoints to support what he actually teaches. Physiology is not an easy subject, if you plan not to study quite frequent, do not take him. He is willing to help with any question you may have. Book is not needed"
6252,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Coro is EXTREMELY knowledgeable when it comes to anatomy &amp; physiology. Anatomy is a tough subject. He makes it clear in the beginning of the class that it's important to study not only to pass the exams, but to use what you learn so you can advance to Anatomy 2 &amp; nursing /med school . Yes, he does lectures heavy, but its for your own good."
6253,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,2.0,4.0,"Very intelligent professor &amp; knows what is anatomy is about in the deepest level of the human body .. sadly, I cant learn by someone just talking, and talking, and talking all DAY LONG ! I need an interactive professor so i can learn. If you learn by listening and reading , this might be a good choice other than that... I hope you have the answers!"
6254,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,1.0,5.0,His teaching style is stuck in the 1920's!
6255,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BCS2085,5.0,3.0,". His lecture is two hours long &amp; he provides a 5 min break. His class consists of three exams &amp; two extra credits hw's that you can find on quizlet. He is a professor that wants his students to learn &amp; is a genius. NO TEXTBOOK REQUIRED. If you can't find the test answers from a previous student, STUDY! Cant be absent more than 4 times."
6256,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,AP2085,3.0,5.0,"Mr. Coro knows his material very well and if you study very hard then you should do fine. He is available for help and answers emails promptly. He does not let you use your phone in class and you will get yelled at if you do but he really is knowledgeable, it just depends on how much you put into studying. You do not need to buy the book."
6257,1416814,Francisco,Coro,Miami Dade College (all),Anatomy &amp; Physiology,BSC2085,2.0,5.0,"To say I was completely stressed, would be an understatement. His class consists of 3 exams, 2 homeworks and 1 extra credit &amp; mind you, he doesnt give a review for any exam! coming to class is your review is what he said. He goes over so much information, its overwhelming! And his teaching method is just writing on the board the entire class!"
6259,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,5.0,4.0,"I took his class for the summer term during COVID and he was really nice, if you needed help with anything you can just ask he will NOT make you feel dumb. He responds to emails very quickly. I took lecture &amp; lab with him but for lecture just grades test, lab grades quizzes lab reports and tests. You HAVE to study.. Tests are recorded"
6260,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1025,1.0,5.0,"Did not care at all. Asked us to study by the textbook only. No lecture, nothing. I asked him for a practice test or a video to study by and said: The only difference between a practice test and working from a book would be me writing practice test on the top of the sheet of paper. Not very helpful... Had to drop the class."
6261,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,1.0,5.0,"This professor is extremely discouraging. I had him during the pandemic and these times tell the most about a professor. No lecture time just pre recorded videos on YouTube and notes. No curve, No extra credit. find another professor honestly."
6262,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,5.0,3.0,Professor Larry is the type of professor who would wear a shirt that says Science Rules! yet takes his profession very seriously &amp; is very passionate about what he does. He will always attend to your needs during his office hours. He will push you enough for you to pass the class only if you do your part as well. I also recommend him for Lab!
6263,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1025,1.0,5.0,Worst professor Ive ever had. Took him during the pandemic and might as-well learn on my own. I Wasnt a fan of how he taught. The most stressed I have ever been in my life because he only explained a few things and not very well. Had to figure out my own things with zero knowledge of chemistry since this was my first time taking it.
6264,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1045,5.0,3.0,"Overall, he is a very good professor especially for 1025 (he made a book). He does try to be helpful but he tends to get ahead of himself when being asked questions so the student has to be persistent to actually get the answer. I was frustrated with him during the pandemic considering he changed the format of the test completely but I understand."
6265,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1045,5.0,3.0,"Chemistry is a hard subject to begin with, so get ready to study a lot. I've taken Professor Mailloux for both CHM1025 &amp; CHM1045, and he was by far one of the best professor's at MDC. He is super strict during exams, which I don't blame him. If you want to become something in the medical field, you should not cheat your way to it. So don't be lazy!"
6266,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1045,1.0,5.0,Made the class harder than it needed to be. During the quarantine the test were ridiculously hard. Not given enough time during Test 3 with 3 part answer problems. Final was multiple choice with 8 answers to choose from. GL passing and not wasting your time.
6267,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1045,5.0,3.0,"Excellent teacher, during the pandemic he answered emails quickly, help outside of class. Excited in each test, really strict in the exams, and I think that it is the right thing because we prepare to be professionals. He teaches with values. He tries that the students who really deserve it grading for their effort in learning and not for cheating."
6268,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,1.0,5.0,"This Professor wants you to fail. He makes us the book and his book that's incomplete and has errors. His exams are not Stupid easy but you miss out on points for things you didn't know you had to really study. No Test reviews, thinks everyone's cheats, loud, JUST RUN RUN.I cant finish my review not another Characters left. RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN R"
6269,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1045,1.0,5.0,"His test are very hard since they are verbatimly the same as the homework questions. This overall makes you memorize the homework but not the actual content. The lectures don't reflect the test since about 85% of his test are from the homework. No extra credit or homework grades, 4-5 tests in total. and the final replace the lowest grade."
6270,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1045L,5.0,3.0,"His lab class is an usual lab, he is always willing to help you out with any problems you might have during the experiments. You have to take about 4 exams and you are going to need to study from the book the review sheets since he doesn't go over them that much. Other than that most of the grades come from the lab reports, attendance and notebook."
6271,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1025,5.0,4.0,"There is only 4 test that you will take, and as long as you study from the FREE BOOK that he gives you and follow the topic list for the exams you will pass the class. This means long hours of studying and reviewing his book and the concepts in it. His lectures are good and he teaches the main concepts, but you have to later review by yourself."
6272,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033L,5.0,4.0,"Mailloux really makes you work for your grade but he will tell you everything that you did wrong and how to fix it. He is a tough grader, but he cares. During the pandemic we had switched to online classes and I had fallen on hard times and he helped me keep my grade at a passing level. You have to work for your grade though."
6273,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,4.0,4.0,"Although intimidating, pretty nice teacher if you get on his good side. This is a very demanding class, requires a lot of studying and putting in the work. No homework assigned, so your grade depends on exams. His book that he created is very useful and helpful when taking his tests. Just study."
6274,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1025L,4.0,3.0,Weird but good professor. Got angry at his markers a lot. Lectures were helpful though!
6275,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1045,5.0,4.0,"I took CHM 1025 with Prof. Mailloux also, and I would not have taken it with any other Professor. I am a returning student and I had not taken Chemistry since high school, but with Prof. Mailloux's teaching skills, I find myself learning more than expected. The tests are passable if you study in your own time. The material itself is hard regardless"
6276,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1045,3.0,5.0,"He's a good professor and you can really tell he cares about his students learning. With that being said, DO NOT take this class if you have a full time job or taking difficult classes He gives about 3 chapters to read with about 50 questions on each chapter so you can study Also, if you didn't take him for CHM 1025 you WILL struggle in this class"
6277,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1045,1.0,4.0,is very rude and unprofessional. Made the class stressful more so than it already is. His tests are extremely difficult but his lectures are lazy. He expects you to give 110% when all he does is a handful of easy problems on the board to then put things that are ten times harder on the tests. No homework to help with grade and the final is 30%
6278,1483710,Lawrence,Mailloux,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1045,1.0,5.0,"Run away. I am taking him now. He started class saying he hasnt taught chm1045 on 5 years. He expects you to know it all. Get ready to teach yourself. On exams he gives you a calculator to use, which is so cheap and barely works. Oh &amp; he has someone come on exam days to walk around and make sure youre not cheating. He makes you show work on Tests"
6280,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1147,4.0,2.0,"Professor Peters is a Good Professor. Unfortunately she went through a few hardships over the last couple of semesters which cause her to miss class more than normal. She's a good person, very caring and understanding. Tests are relatively easy if you go over the study guide and she gives partial credit for just showing your work."
6281,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1147,4.0,2.0,"Ms. Peters is actually an AMAZING math professor, if a student has failed in the past it's mainly their fault for not studying hard enough. Like everyone else, she hit a rough patch recently and I am not aware of her current situation, she missed class often, so take at your own risk. She always gives out study guides for her tests, HW is online."
6282,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,I have nothing against Professor Peters. She actually one of the best math professors at Wolfson Campus and I can honestly say she teaches in a way for you to understand the material. This semester she stopped coming due to personal reasons and we were stuck with a substitute for the last two weeks of the semester.
6283,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Don't get me wrong, I like her and she is a good professor but she missed too many classes."
6284,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Amazing Professor. I love her style of teaching and she makes math easy to understand, However she missed A LOT of classes this semester due to personal reasons which is is affecting us."
6285,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"So I am going to be straight up honest, I failed her class. It was not her fault however; she's amazing! I had a lot of honors society kids in my class that were constantly skipping ahead while she was trying to go over questions from previous lessons &amp; homework. I felt very intimidated to ask questions and was often left confused because of them."
6286,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,4.0,3.0,Great Prof!! She kinda missed a lot of class but as long as you go and pay attention you will pass. Also understanding if you miss test and etc.
6287,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,Must have professor
6288,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,"I LOVE Prof. PETERS, She's awkward and old school. But this lady knows her stuff, she makes everything clear and its hard not to understand. Her tests are tricky but short. HW is the usual... Not really big in attendance but if you miss class, no one will be able to explain the material like she does, so don't. Take her and you won't regret it."
6289,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Professor Peters is an AMAZING mathematics Professor. She is HILARIOUS but since it was a morning class and most people suck, students would laugh at her jokes much, but I did. Professor Peters makes math extremely easy and/or simple. Her class is not hard. I will be taking her for Calculus for sure! Take any of her math classes."
6290,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,1.0,"People are saying ""only take her class if you're good at math"" Like seriously... This was the easiest math class I have ever taken. It should be, ""take this class if you're bad at math"" because she thoroughly teaches it on the board. I just depends on whether you write down the notes and do the HW. Oh and her test are multiple choice!!"
6291,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MATH1033,2.0,4.0,TEST ARE HARD AND NOT ENOUGH TIME TO STUDY
6292,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"anyone hate math? I did! so much! until I met Prof. Peters. SHE IS AMAZING. no accent, good explainer, great at breaking it down, gives good feedback on your tests and answers ALL your questions. BUY THE ACCESS CODE ONLINE from my mathlab, book is there, save your time from the bookstore. Homework easy as pie, tests are too, you won't regret taking"
6293,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"Best math teacher ever! She gives excellent notes and explains everything on detail, the homework online will help your grade a lot, only 4 exams and one final, they are less than 20 questions.(very easy) Will give a review the class before  test and answer questions. As long as you complete review, you'll pass, she's hilarious. TAKE HER!!!!!!"

She helped me understand and actually enjoy Algebra. She is a great ""teacher"", very helpful and patient. She really cares about her students! Take Pro. Peters if you have the choice, trust me you will be happy yo did!! AWESOME! AWESOME!! AWESOME!! LOVE HER!"
6295,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"I'm so glad I picked Professor Peters, she is absolutely amazing!! She is so clear in eveRything. the only thing I would recommend is to study. If you study, like if you really study and paied attention to class the tests should be a piece of cake for you!! Even the final was easy for me. She helps you in any way possible. Don't forget to STUDY!!!"
6296,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,3.0,"What they say is true, prob the best math professor at Dade. So ill give a rundown of the specifics of the class. 60%  5 tests (drops lowest grade), 15%  Online Hw, 25%  Final. Tests are short (8-9 questions) but pack a good punch. Opens all online Hw after the 4th test. Final is ""hard not to pass"" if you catch my drift. Apply's only to Mac2311."
6297,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,2.0,She is one the best math professor at dade. Also one the understanding professors because she gives you many chances to pass her class.
6298,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. I took her for Calc 1 &amp; 2 and aced both classes. She explains everything very clearly and she will answer any questions that you have during her lectures. The homework helps you study for her tests which are not difficult if you come well prepared. If you have the chance to take this professor, DO IT!"
6299,867114,Faith,Peters,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"She is good Everything that she teaches is on the exam U just need to pay attention to the lecture. She gives lots of helpful examples on the board. U have 2 complete the homework which is always due on the same day of each exam.. She ask if anyone needs help from homework. She drop the lowest grade. Exams are show your work, non multiple choice."
6301,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,"Sadly I heard that Professor Schuh is no longer in the MDC, honestly I think it's a big loss since he was one of the best professors of the university, if he still thinks of working in a college near MDC I recommend that take his class wherever he is now."
6302,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI1101,3.0,2.0,Funny man. Gives homework but you can do it.
6303,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,"He have no filter to talk, he said what he think no matter what and encourage you to be a college student. Everything is online and everything is from the book no from his lectures. Great guy."
6304,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"I thought I would dislike this class, but I ended up LOVING it! Professor Schuh may come off as rude, but hes just very blunt...a straight to the point type of guy. He WILL work with you, BUT you must do your part. 4 modules, each have an essay on a quote, questions from the text, and a discussion board. If you do all your work, its an easy A."
6305,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Schuh is definitely one of the best teachers I've had the pleasure of having. If your're lazy DON'T take his class, he gives the amount of work necessary to understand and actually LEARN something. As long as you read (and sometimes re-read) the book for all assignments you should be good. I took his class online and got an A, easy peasy."
6306,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,4.0,2.0,Very short in emails but it's an online course just read the syllabus and you can get the class done fairly quickly
6307,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,1.0,"You do not even need the textbook I bought it for no reason. Easiest class ever. I really recommend it, the discussions and quizzes are very easy and their is just one final only worth 5 percent. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
6308,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Schuh is interesting, intriguing, and simply amazing! If you can't pass his class, it simply means you aren't trying... at all."
6309,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,4.0,"This man is simply amazing. All of his work is online, so you barely have to ever go to class, but why would you not want to? He is hilarious and has no filter. His lectures are crystal clear. Easy A if you do all of your work and turn it in before the due date (all 3 weeks from  each other). DO NOT CHEAT, THAT IS THE ONE THING HE DOES NOT TOLERATE"
6310,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"My philosophy was basically everything online. I almost never showed up to class, but all the work is 4 modules with 15 questions, discussion boar and one essay all of this was from his book ( which you NEED to buy you wont pass without it ). Believe it or not i hates anything with philosophy, but it taught me so MUCH and i loved it."
6311,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,"His class is extremely easy. All you have to do is the assignments. The book IS required. Without it, you will fail. All his work is online and you don't even have to show up to class to pass. Just read the book and answer the questions. Don't plagiarize because he will know and fail you. Super easy class though if you do the work and don't cheat"
6312,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,It's really up to you if you pass or not. He let's you know all the due dates from the start and all modules are open so you can work on them whenever you want. It's mostly essays and discussions regarding philosophical questions based on your opinion. One proctored final which I think is optional &amp; textbook is basically used for EVERY assignment.
6313,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,"Schuh is absolutely crazy, but you will love him. He is extremely blunt. Gives you everything for the entire class the first day and all the due dates. It is your responsibility to turn them in on time. No final or tests/quizzes in or out of class. DO NOT CHEAT BECAUSE YOU WILL GET EXPELLED AND MADE FUN OF! Very entertaining and keeps it 100% real."
6314,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,2.0,"I took the class online, wasn't that hard. He takes some time to grade your work, and doesn't really respond to emails. He drops all the work on you with dates and its up to you to finish.  Graded all my work with 100%  even when it was sloppy, goes to show how he is."
6315,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,1.0,His a awesome teacher. All he cares is to do your work and not copy from the internet he will fail you. But just get the book an analyze what you read. Super nice an wants you to pass. Gives easy work and lots of time to do it
6316,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,2.0,He is super easy if you do your part. He tells you exactly what he wants for his assignments. Yes the book is mandatory to answer the questions. You also have plenty of time to finish each module. You can even go ahead and do more than one module if you want to finish faster. He is nice don't listen to what people say about him.
6317,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2064,5.0,2.0,"His syllabus is clear as to what he expects and wants from you, he'll send reminders before the modules are due. He doesn't really accept last work once its graded because he gives you enough time to do it! Recommend him!"
6318,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,1.0,"You can skip every single class and still get an A in this class. Not that you'd want to, of course; Schuch is hysterical and makes philosophy interesting and fun.   10/10 would take again."
6319,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,4.0,2.0,He is clear in his syllabus of what he expects from you. Just be prepared to write  in an essay format and read a lot. Not difficult if you read  what is assigned.
6320,474575,Matthew,Schuh,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,1.0,4.0,"By far the worst professor I've ever had in my life. If you ask him a question he doesnt even answer it... he says something else and is very vague. He does not know how to teach, he's also very very arrogant."
6322,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,5.0,"He doesnt reply to emails, and is extremely sarcastic! I got a perfect score on 3 separate homeworks and he put a zero in the gradebook, I emailed him and it remained the same. I still passed the class but that wasnt fair"
6323,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1114,4.0,5.0,Good teacher but very strict so dont slack off. Listen to what he says and youll actually pass this class. He also speaks very fast so ask questions when youre confused.
6324,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"By Far worst professor ever. He is strict,sarcastic, and disrespectful. God forbids you send him an email or text, his answers are extremely sarcastic. He teaches horrible by reading from a power point. He sets you up to fail by giving a test everyday in class,the grade is 100 or 0. and he give 4 test in total. Doesn't help nor cares. Don't take"
6325,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,2.0,5.0,"Honestly, I do not recommend this professor. Whatsoever. He was difficult and wasnt understanding. Super strict. He was funny sometimes, but funny isnt what Im looking for to pass this class."
6326,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,4.0,"Do NOT take this class with Gil! Hes very disrespectful and attempts to belittle you if you ask any questions or raise any concerns. Had it not been for my prior background in calculus, Im almost positive I would Have failed this class. He does not explain anything thoroughly and expects you to understand everything right off the bat."
6327,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN! So disrespectful and does not care for his students. Gives quizzes almost every class but he does not teach well and expects you to know the subject by heart. Deserves no right to call himself a teacher.
6328,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,Yes there is pop quizzes but if you are punctual for class they're an easy A. I'm the worst at math and I needed to pass this class at all costs. Going to his office hours was the best thing i've could've done. He helped me out with future tests and I ended up passing by miracle. As hard as it was I would take him again because he really helped me.
6329,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,1.0,4.0,He is awful! He is extremely boring I wouldn't recommend this class to my worst enemy.
6330,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,2.0,3.0,"Professor Gil is really tough, he makes a quiz everyday. The class I took was at 7am and he took a quiz everyday at 7am and we finish at 7:05. He doesnt make examples or teach the class. He just read the entire class. If you take him , make sure you can study by yourself an be punctual."
6331,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STAT2023,1.0,5.0,if You guys see this DONT take this class with this professor. Hes rude and doesnt care if you get it or not. You have to take a quiz every class which he makes. Dont ask any questions because he wont answer it and just keep going on. DONT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR They make me rate him a one but hes a big 0
6332,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,1.0,He is a great professor he helps you understand the materials.
6333,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,4.0,"Reading These Reviews And All I Can Say Is WOW. Here Is A REAL Review. Professor Gil Is GREAT HOWEVER You Do Have To Apply Yourself. This Is Math People. You Have To Grasp The Concept. As Long As He See You Are Trying Which Means NOT SKIPPING CLASS, ASKING QUESTIONS, And Of Course Knowing The Material, HE WILL PASS YOU. You Get What You Put Out."
6334,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1140,1.0,5.0,"made the class way more difficult than it should be, gave a quiz almost every meeting, if you're not good at math dont take him. you're gonna need to study heavy for that class."
6335,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,No Homework. 3 tests and 1 final. So you cant bring your grade up. Avoid this teacher . Take anyone else
6336,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,1.0,"Contrary to popular belief Mr gil will not pass you for trying your best. Some students have not read his rules nor do they understand proper math--thus leaving them confused as to why they passed the course. 1 of my friends that took the class along side me nearly sufficated of sleep deprivation because of this course, but failed non the less."
6337,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2312,2.0,3.0,"horrible, marks hard just does questions from book , hard to communicate with outside of class, literally couldnt care less if you fail or pass"

6341,618774,Carlos,Gil,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"So I took Professors Gil's class for the Fall semester. One thing I'm use to when it comes to math classes is to be ready for homework, to be graded on homework and that the professor is ready to explain the subject matter for those who do not understand. Sadly Professor Gil did none of that. only thing graded are 4 test. If you fail two that's it."
6343,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,2.0,"Professor Willoughby is the sweetest, she makes all of the assignments clear and tells you exactly what to do.

This professor is super sweet, she extends due dates to the maximum and gives an infinite amount of extra credit opportunities. Just make sure you complete all the assignments. The only thing that was some what annoying was the paper project at the beginning. But still worth the class. Super fun and easy."
6354,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,1.0,"I wish I could give a zero for level of difficulty. There is only 3 tests, a few journals (on personal opinions), and few group assignments which are started and finished within the same class period. The only effort you'll find yourself doing is summarizing several current events and a project in the beginning of the course to help you research."
6355,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,2.0,"Easy class if you pay attention, i loved this class and would take her again. Shes very sweet and caring. I took her fall 2018"
6356,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,2.0,She is awesome! the class is really entertaining and she cares about her students and makes sure we like the assignments we are doing. There are some group projects but they are all done in class and are super easy. Study the study guide she gives you for the test (she gives you the answers) and you will get an A.
6357,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor. Loved her. She doesnt really go into boring lectures, explains everything clearly, is willing to help you out with anything and even gives you more time for some assignments. Not too many assignments even though it feels like it. Very understanding and sweet. I would definitely take her again. You will not regret it."
6358,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2OOO,5.0,1.0,Loved her class!! Just make sure you do your work and youll pass.
6359,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,1.0,"Literally best teacher I ever took there's absolutely no way to fail that class she even takes late work but she gives so much time for the work I would feel bad turning in something late. The class is very enjoyable, and she will do anything to help you pass. TAKE HERRRR YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT I PROMISE!!!!"
6360,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,3.0,2.0,Good solid choice.
6361,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,2.0,She is very sweet and caring. Accepts late work but her class is so easy I'd feel bad turning anything in late! Study guides are given for the tests and NO POP QUIZZES! What I love the most is that she hands out almost all of the assignments that will be due throughout the semester in the first week of class!!
6362,80093,Lois,Willoughby,Miami Dade College (all),Science,DEP2000,5.0,1.0,She gives a lot of papers but she dose it so that you don't have to take many notes.
6364,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,Great professor!! Would definitely take him again.
6365,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,5.0,He was helpful n by yet we had a lot of assignment and in connectMath we had more than 70 exercises and it is only a 5% of my grade.... a lot of homework and quizzes. I got and A but I had to work a lot every day.
6366,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"Take him!! I thought I was bad at math until I took him. He explains EVERYTHING. Homework and quizzes are online, they are similar. Tests are in class and straight out from the practice tests and homework so make sure you do them before the tests. He is super nice and if you have questions he will explain. Pay attention and you will pass"
6367,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"This professor was so good, if you do all the assignments and pay attention in his class you are gonna pass. His class is not difficult at all but you have to study. I highly recommend taking him. :)"
6368,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Great math professor, I would take him again but due to my schedule, I can't. No textbook required so don't buy it save your money. if you take his blended class is mostly the assignments done in MCgrawhill math connect and you will need to buy a code. 4 quizzes done online and 4 tests in class with an optional final with practice tests."
6369,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,His class is based on the hw and if you do it youll have no problem. Its simple to get an A in the class if you just show up and do his hw. Really nice professor &amp; teaches clearly. 4 exams &amp; an optional final. One of the best math profs at Kendall campus.
6370,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2312,2.0,4.0,"1) Bad: I don't know about other math classes, but for calculus 2 he's not that good. It's complicated to understand him and lectures are heavy. 2)Good: The exams are fair and he gives extra credit. He's a good person and understanding. If you study by yourself you'll pass, but don't expect to understand his lectures."
6371,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,He is a great professor! he does go fast but he is clear with the material and has clear handwriting. you have quizzes online and 4 tests in class. as long as you practice and do your homework it is an easy A. the final is optional if you want to replace a grade with a better one. he posts practice tests so you can have an idea of what to expect.
6372,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,2.0,4.0,"Hes a nice professor and will give you extra credit if you do a few problems on the board. However, he has a very thick accent making it hard to understand his lectures and he also goes fast. If you are bad at math... DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!"
6373,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,If math is not your strongest subject i suggest you do not take professor cabezas. his lectures and explanations for the lessons are hard to understand &amp; confusing. He goes way too fast when hes explaining something &amp; if you did not understand the lesson you will NOT pass his test. only things that help you pass are homework &amp; online quizzes.
6374,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,Teaches extremely fast. Not recommended at all especially if youre mad at math.
6375,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,Super easy class! And the teacher is extremely noble! He's a real gem.
6376,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,5.0,Would not reccomend if you are bad at math.
6377,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC2312,1.0,4.0,He's very confusing. Prepare to learn by yourself
6378,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,A total of 4 tests. The final replaces your lowest test grade. A lot of homework and its 30% of your grade. Not a hard class but if you are bad at math then don't skip. He is really nice and teaches well.
6379,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,Great professor! HW is 30% of the grade. Total of 4 exams. The 4th exam replaces the lowest grade if you pass. Dont skip class if you are bad at math. Take notes. You should be fine
6380,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,1.0,1.0,grade are base on your quizez midterm and final
6381,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"honestly, I am not the best at math but his test were easy to pass. he is a very caring person and makes the final optional, i failed 3 test and still ended with a B"
6382,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,3.0,Gives multiple chances for success.
6383,242166,Roberto,Cabezas,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,3.0,4.0,"Ehhh , he goes FAST but if you go to his class and you ask him hell let you pass if you try just do all the homework and quizzes and youll be set ! Wouldnt take him if your HORRIBLE at math btw!"
6385,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,1.0,"I was afraid of the class because I am not good at math. From start Dr. Keane made me feel at ease. As the course went on it became even easier. She teaches online but actually shows up in the videos with a board, etc etc. Will take her again for MGf 1107 . Each quiz has a review and so is the at home Midterm and Final. Easy."
6386,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,5.0,1.0,Great professor. Easy class. Not too demanding. All questions in homework show up in the quizzes. I felt very prepared. I want to take her again. I hope that she teaches MGF 1107 in the Spring. A real gem in terms of teaching. Many online professor dont teach anything. This professor follows up with questions and goes on a virtual board....
6387,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,1.0,5.0,"Told us the first day of class to rate her on here. She is extremely rude to her students (not even behind emails, but IN FRONT OF THE CLASS) and is unempathetic during this pandemic. You ask her a question, basically tells you to shove it. IDK how she has such good ratings, it's clear she bribes students."
6388,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,1.0,3.0,"She is a horrible professor. She seems sweet in the beginning but she is extremely fake. As soon as you do something that she relatively does not like, her true color shows. She embarrasses and is extremely rude towards her students. We are in a middle of a pandemic and she still gives over 100 question homework's. No empathy towards her students!"
6389,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,5.0,1.0,By far the easiest class in math that I took in life. The course is quite well structured and material is easy if you use the resources. The reviews are very similar to the tests. Prof is available for questions and is quite involved. Loved the class.
6390,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,4.0,2.0,"Was really nervous taking this teacher due to the negative comments but she was extremely easy. All her work was done in a website and it was extremely helpful with difficult questions. Im horrible in math and I passed with a good grade. None of her exams were proctored and if you were lucky, you would get the same questions from the study guide."
6391,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,1.0,5.0,"Never in my years of school have I met a teacher who is disrespectful . If you try your best, she'll still call you stupid for not getting the answer correct. This teacher is beyond the rudest person I've ever met. She gives more than 100 questions for hw. Does not teach good, only way to learn is by educating yourself. Don't know why she teaches."
6392,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,5.0,1.0,In the middle of this pandemic the professor offered Midterm and Final Exam with open notes and take home. How easy is this? How caring this shows her. Really great prof. Available in virtual room for extra help as often as the class needs.
6393,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,2.0,1.0,"The class is easy to pass, just do the homeworks and you will be fine. She however is very passive aggressive and will be rude whenever possible. She is also uncompromising even in the middle of a pandemic, if there is a problem it's your own fault, even if it isn't. The mathlab isn't working? Use another computer. Quiz crashed? guess you fail"
6394,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,5.0,1.0,"The course is so easy because Dr, Keane makes it this way. I am not good at math but the reviews are very similar to all exams. Plus this professor is soooo fast responding to question. I think the amount of homework she gives is to help us. Also she encourages group chats. Really loving professor. leanred a lot and loved the class."
6395,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,1.0,5.0,"she was very mean and unfair, gives students very rude responses to simple questions, you cant email her because apparently it bothers her not quite sure why and on top of that her exams are extremely hard even for math lovers and she won't help with anything you ask her overall she made my last semester horrible please save yourself from her."
6396,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,5.0,1.0,"Taking her right now. The best experience I ever had in math in mdc or in my life. I feel that I can ask this professor anything and she will take the time to respond. She also makes things so much easier than most and is very aware of the pandemic. Offers help, advertise free tutoring through mdc. CARES."
6397,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,5.0,2.0,"Took this professor last semester when the school changed to online bec of virus. Professor Keane is soooooooo dedicated. She reaches out more than any prof I had in the past. And this is Math. The course itself is easy and reviews really help. But she makes this online experience much easier with her constant emails, and her prompt feedback."
6398,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,5.0,1.0,EASY class. Easy tests. Easy feedback. No regrets. Take this class
6399,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,5.0,2.0,I cannot thank enough this professor. Really amazing. The course is well set. The tests all have reviews. She is always available to help. She responds very fast. Even in weekends. She sends weekly announcements to keep you posted and emails you when issues are private and individual. I love this class!
6400,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,1.0,5.0,"The WORST and rudest professor. You can't email her with questions, you must ask questions, even if they are private, in the discussion board and she will not answer them, other students must. If she does reply, it's not to answer but to tell you everything you are doing wrong. The tests are nothing like she says and she does not grade fair either."
6401,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1107,5.0,2.0,This professor is amazing. Reaches out to find out if we need help and helps. Available even on weekends. I wish I needed another math class bec I would take it with her. THE BEST!
6402,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1106,1.0,4.0,"I hated this class, she is rude and very pushy FOR NO REASON she even bullies her students. LOTS OF HOMEWORK, we're talking about 150 questions a WEEK. she does not teach, talks too much, and never gets to the point. you will be doing a lot independent learning bc you won't learn anything from her class. Especially if you take her once a week."
6403,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,4.0,3.0,Best professor ever. All that I always feared in math went away when I had this professor. Take the class with her.
6404,786755,Eliane,Keane,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MGF1006,5.0,3.0,"This professor rocks . I took her twice: MGF 1106 and 1107 done in 8 wks. All of a sudden because of virus the course moved to online but I loved it. Prof created a virtual room and we meet weekly and more if we needed. Very helpful and there for us all the time. Yes, she does give tons of homework but there is time to do it . Also the reviews!!!"
6406,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,This professor made my first real semester at MDC (Fall 2019) actually enjoyable. Do all the assignments and you should get an A. Minimal effort is required for tests as long as you pay attention to the lectures and read. There are some papers but and group projects but as long as you follow the rubric you'll be fine.
6407,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,1.0,"Just finished online course. Great professor! Work is due at the end of every month, which seems simple enough but if youre not on top of it its easy to forget since theres no set dates in calendar. Gives extra credit and drops two lowest quiz grades. Great communication! Would take again!"
6408,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,2.0,"Amazing intelligent woman, very helpful, always update you on things and drops 2 of your lowest grades... I would definitely take her if Ive gotten another chance!!! Best ever"
6409,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,1.0,"Class could have been more challenging. Take her for a guaranteed A with no real work required. I passed with an A but don't feel I learned anything :( I didn't read anything because I didn't have to. She does not make you work for your grade. There is 1 midterm, no final. Gives you a lot of time to complete assignments and minimal work."
6410,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,1.0,2.0,This class has been the most pointless class I've ever taken. I was so excited to take Sociology especially with society now but her class was beyond words boring and her assignments/projects teach you nothing. She is extremely unnecessarily strict about phones and it gets annoying. Please choose another teacher.
6411,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,1.0,"PROFESSOR G was great. If i can take her again i would. She is very caring, it is evident that if you dont show up to class and half ass the work then you wil obv fail. Do the work, show up, and receive an A!"
6412,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,2.0,4.0,She can not remeber anything. Make sure you get everything in email for this reason; and make sure it's emailed through blackboard or she'll say she can't help you. If you're a min late she will not give you credit for the day. If you're absent on the day somthing is due automatic 50% on it. If you have a cell phone out in class she'll yell at you.
6413,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,2.0,wonderful professor. Access student should take her
6414,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,3.0,Do not be late. I was never be late. Do not use the phone
6415,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,Very good professor
6416,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,4.0,2.0,I LOVED GOING TO THIS CLASS IT WAS INTERESTING AND FUN. SHE IS STRICT WITH ATTENDANCE AND CELL PHONES. TESTS ARE EASY AND IF HOMEWORK IS DONE YOU WILL GET A GOOD GRADE.
6417,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,4.0,1.0,"So i'm going to be completely honest... At first she was extremely annoying to me, but then she started to rub off on me. She really is a sweetheart when you get to know her, but make sure you do her work because everything in that class is literally there for your own benefit.. If you're late just stay home, if you skip her class, you'll fail"
6418,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,"Strict on attendance. Shes a very good teacher. Good lectures. Tests are online, everything on quizlet. Interesting class. Strict no phone policy though."
6419,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Gluskoter loves to teach and it shows. She always came prepared to class and created an ideal atmosphere that promoted learning through respect, intelligent discussion and fun. Most of the class was engaged and I'm sure we all learned many very important concepts that we will use either in our lives or careers, if not both. Course is a must."
6420,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,Proffesor G is hands down one of my favorite proffesor in all my schooling history. She teaches the material in a way that not only makes it interesting but in a way that you can understand the material. Participating in her class came very natural to me and made the expierence better to pass the course. She knows her materail very well! Take her!!
6421,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,"No book, easy online quizzes and test. Only a couple of assignments"
6422,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,2.0,she's the best.
6423,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,1.0,"I had great taking Professor G this semester. She's very fair with her assignments, projects, and quizzes, and attendance. She talks too much, but all the stuff she be saying is what happened in are world. I highly recommend everyone to take her"
6424,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,2.0,"I'm currently taking her class and I love professor G, just make sure you come to class on time and i only think its fair that she has the attendance policy, incident happen in life and we may be late sometimes, but if your a person that don't like coming to school or always late don't waste your time or her time taking her class i highly recommend"
6425,640065,Cara,Gluskoter,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,3.0,A great teacher. Only thing that she is strict on is punctuality and no phones. Her lectures are great and she's hilarious. Her tests are all online and they are straight from the book so there's no reason to cheat or get less than an A in her class. Recommended!
6427,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor ever. I wonder is he is a professor. Bud gay, bad manners, extremely impolite to be in a classroom, run from him.."
6428,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,5.0,4.0,"I took him twice, failed the first time bc I wasnt serious. But he is a brilliant man. Very lecture heavy, but they are interesting. He is very passionate but strict and just wants to be respected. Don't be late and study your notes and listen to the playlist for music part of test. You'll find yourself researching what he talks about on your own:)"
6429,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,4.0,3.0,"Do the work, follow his rubric and you should be fine."
6430,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,"I took him for Summer B during the pandemic so the class was online. Grades were based on discussion boards, quizzes, connect assignments, an essay (easy), no midterm, and the final was not proctored. Overall, it was an easy class and he made sure to help us along the way. Highly recommend him!"
6431,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1012,5.0,4.0,"Professor Marc is by far one of the most inspirational, and dedicated teachers on his respective subject. This class isnt for slackers or unmotivated students, you have to have a willing attitude to listen and learn. Everything he lectures is with passion, and enthusiasm and its directly whats on the tests. Great class, and you will learn."
6432,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,5.0,4.0,"He is the BEST professor I have ever had. His way of lecturing is great, it really engages you. He spends a lot of time preparing for his lectures and you can tell, he cares for what he is teaching. His enthusiasm makes you want to learn! His tests are pretty easy if you study. My lowest grade was a 95. He's a very kind person if you show you care!"
6433,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,"Very respectable and hilarious professor! he always takes his work seriously but still makes the class interesting. There is a midterm for the class and be prepared to take multiple quizzes and tests. The textbook is not required, so rely on your notes. Make sure you show up to class on time!"
6434,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,1.0,5.0,"Very passionate about teaching, but whats the point of being passionate if youre going to make the class extremely difficult on purpose? I took him because his reviews were good but they were not accurate. Mid term and final are combined 80% of your grade. Doesnt post his PowerPoints online which makes everything more difficult on purpose."
6435,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,One of the best teachers I ever had! Easy A!
6436,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,MUT2117,5.0,3.0,"If youre going to take a music theory class, definitely take Magellan. Had him for Theory IV and Ive learned so much from him. He can be intimidating at first but hes a very respectable professor and will help you get a good grade. His lectures are amazing and very detailed. If you dont understand something, hes always there to help."
6437,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,"the most interesting class I have ever taken! Magellan made this class one I looked forward to. He genuinely loves teaching humanities and it shows in his lectures. Only two essays, a midterm, and final for your grade. Lots of memorization but extremely doable"
6438,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,2.0,4.0,"His class summed up. You wont pass if youre absent a lot. He gives 2 exams, theyre long and about 100 questions. Youll need to study around 300 terms for them. Study the music if you want an A. Hes going to show you a lot of pictures of his vacations and he will snap if you complain about the test, saying you should have studied more."
6439,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,this guys awesome! super funny and humble. whoever complains about him must be idiots who fail. Easy A.

6441,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,1.0,4.0,"It's like he enjoys making things hard for students and gets satisfaction from ""knowing everything"" he's on some type of power trip and it shows. His lectures are awesome and he's very passionate but he could definitely put his damn powerpoints online, He needs to understand no one's life revolves around his class and he needs to chil lout."
6442,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,Very nice professor he is super passionate teaching every class. You do quizzes on every unit TIMED but they are easy. For the midterm and final he will give you a blueprint so you prepare to pass easily.

6444,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,3.0,4.0,"He's very passionate about teaching. So with that being said his tests can be a little hard if you don't actually take enough time to study for it. He expects you to know paintings, artists, music names, time periods, and also the composer. All testing is based on his PowerPoints only and there is no personal access. Don't interrupt his class."
6445,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,"I have taken Marc Magellan as a professor a little a while ago; must I say he is a great professor, most certainly one of the best professors I have ever had in the Kendall Campus. Read the study guide and you most certainly will pass."
6446,1305666,Marc,Magellan,Miami Dade College (all),Music,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,"The classes are packed for a good reason. He gives great, easy to follow lectures and grades based on regular section quizzes, a midterm and a final. As long as you study throughout the midterm and final should be cake, but still doable if you cram. No textbook needed and class is genuinely fun and surprisingly interactive for the size."
6448,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020ONLINE,5.0,3.0,"Professor Garman is an amazing professor. This class is not only fun but you learn a lot! You do have weekly quizes, discussion boards, and assignments but very interesting subject. Also have two visitation papers, 1- a museum and 2- a theater play. Midterm is proctored, final is not. Also gives extra credit opportunity. Very organized."
6449,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,Honestly one of the best teachers that cares about your grade. The class is very easy but be ready to work in a group. Some online book work that's easy to online and don't stress of you miss one there are makeup dates. Professor Garmen will listen to your problems and will help you out to the best of her ability. Go to class to stay enrolled.
6450,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,This faculty member is the best. She gives a lot of work but it is not hard. She is caring and kind and always gets back to you right away. I wish all professors cared as much as she does.
6451,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020ONLINE,2.0,3.0,"Prepare for a huge amount of home work. To put it into better perspective, one week we had a discussion (with two replies), connect home work with a total of about 100 questions, and a ""quiz"" with 50 questions. This class is quantity over quality 100%. Can't forget the extreme ways to fail. Didn't do one paper, fail, missed the midterm, fail."
6452,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,Simple class that consisted of * Two group projects * Visit a museum and write about what you saw/felt * Online homework (a lot but it's very easy)
6453,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,"Great professor, gets back to you fast which is important since she is online. Gives a lot of work: homework, quizzes, projects, and extra credit work! Helps you boost up your grade. Yes you need the textbook but she gives you the opportunity to makeup your work. Midterm proctored and final online and not proctored. Good teacher though, trust me."
6454,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,Professor Garman is an amazing professor. She gives a lot of work but its enjoyable for the most part. She gives a whole bunch of extra credit. Comes in clutch. Youll only fail the class if youre really lazy. I personally wasnt into the class because the humanities I was learning wasnt as interesting but I got an easy A.
6455,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,3.0,3.0,I took this class online thinking it would be easy but I was wrong this class has been more work than my non-online classes every week we had 1 quiz 1 discussion(sometimes 2) and connect questions that most of the weeks it had over 50 questions also there were two big papers. BEWARE if you dont complete all her homeworks she will drop you
6456,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,"If you don't watch the videos you will get a pop quiz. Professor Garman was a very good teacher and gives you a study guide that you fill out about what's on her midterm and final. Attendance is mandatory or you will be dropped from the class. Very passionate about her class and gives excellent feedback on assignments, very caring."
6457,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,Professor Garman was the best teacher I have ever had. She gives a lot of extra credit opportunities &amp; has three projects throughout the year. Two are museum/theater visitations &amp; another is some book project which are all very easy. exams are all based on the study guides. Definitely take her you wont regret it! She is very understanding and nice
6458,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"You can tell she loves what she teaches. She's very animated and lively so I never found class to be boring. She cares about your advancement in the class, grades fairly, gives a lot of chances for extra credit, and explains the material clearly and thoroughly."
6459,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,3.0,2.0,The class in general is easy. But Professor Garman expects way to much out of students. She expects to keep the conversion going and some people don't have time for that. I would take the course again but with another teacher. Work is easy but the connect smart book has questions over 80 which i think its a lot to do in a online course.
6460,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,Ok I will start by saying I hate this course but professor garman made it bareable. You will read a lot and there are a lot of assignments but if u do the u will be fine. Do the study guides is all I will say!
6461,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"Professor Garman is amazing! Her lectures are always clear and fun.

Her work is extremely easy if you just put your effort into it and time as well. She makes class very fun and she's funny. Very caring so if you have any question, just ask. Took her my first semester and don't regret it. If i could take her again, i totally would so take her!"

6465,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,This online course was not difficult at all. Consists of multiple choice quizzes and discussion posts. You have one mandatory in person multiple choice midterm and the rest is online. Her class was not hard at all and it's definitely easy to past with an A. She gives you two make up weeks and loads of extra credit. Great Professor
6466,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020,1.0,4.0,"Professor Garman is extremely rude, and too inconsiderate to consider herself an educator. Her work load is excessive to be a humanities class. After multiple attempts to reach her, she finally called back with an attitude. She had already decided who I was and my capabilities, before speaking to me. I strongly suggest you save your time and GPA."
6467,544683,Sarah,Garman,Miami Dade College (all),Humanities,HUM1020ONLINE,5.0,3.0,Minus the practice questions for each chapter. Professor Garman is great! one discussion and a quiz for each chapter and two visitation papers . Loves how she allows you to make up your assignments and she is very understanding. all you have to do is your assingment
6469,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pedaraza is by far one of the best Professors I've had at MDC. Her priority is ALWAYS her students. She wants you to learn and use your knowledge in your daily life. She is supremely knowledgeable. She's funny, but can be strict at times. In conclusion, sh wants her students to succeed. I wish all professors cared as much as she does."
6470,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,"Alright, I know what most of you guys might be thinking. Mixed signals coming from the reviews. However, hopefully, you'll make a good decision and take her class. Professor Pedraza is nothing but knowledgeable, very. Stories told, making you laugh and learn, makes it all the worthwhile. There are tests, but if you have the right mindset, then..."
6471,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,2.0,"Professor Pedraza is an absolute must take at MDC, this was the first semester where I felt moved by a professor and actually learned outside the realm of the classroom. She connects the subject matter to real life and is extremely funny. Go to class! Her exams are based on her lectures as long as you go and pay attention it's an easy A."
6472,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,1.0,"The class I've learned the most in. Great teacher, a pleasure to have been in her las t class ever."
6473,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,1.0,1.0,She was rude and inconsiderate. She was terrible at answering questions. She was offensive to students and bad mouthed a lot. She is extremely confusing. I don't understand how she is teaching. look at the other unloaded reviews for her. yikes!
6474,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SGY2000,1.0,1.0,She cursed a lot. She gave us the questions and answers to the tests so we can memorize it at home. She yells the lecture.
6475,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,POS2112,4.0,2.0,"Easy online class. Quizzes, Pre test, Test and some journals make up her class. Super easy if you do the work."

6482,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SOC1020,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Pedraza is one of those professors that you simply HAVE to take if you're in MDC. She is inspirational, amazing, and extremely educated. I looked forward to her lectures everyday as you always learn something new and interesting. She is a fantastic professor, but get to know her, she is even more extraordinary of a person. Take her!!!"
6483,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,ISS1120,5.0,2.0,"I took Professor Pedraza's Social Environment class for Fall 2017 and I absolutely loved it. She respects her students and treats them like adults. Basically all you have to do is listen to her lectures, take notes, and do the online quiz and tests. Only the midterm is in class. The rest is online."
6484,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,ISS1120,3.0,3.0,I found this class to be really easy. LOTS of tests but they are online and are from the book. There's only one proctored test (midterm) which she gives you the study guide for. She loves to walk around the class and call on you for random questions. Take notes it helps for the tests. Overall class is easy but she can be annoying. No extra credit.
6485,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,POS2041,5.0,2.0,"Professor Pedraza is just a very unique person. All the quizzes for the chapters are online.

6487,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,POS2041,5.0,3.0,"This is probably the most amazing professor Miami Dade College has, her lectures are funny, relate-able and educational. she is wise. She has real experiences and knowledge that TEXT BOOKS CAN NOT TEACH. my course was blended so unfortunately i only saw her once a week and did my course work online. Would take a million and one times over"
6488,240506,Teresita,Pedraza,Miami Dade College (all),Sociology,SYG2000,3.0,2.0,"Very easy class, all assignments are on blackboard and straight from the book/lecture. My issue with her was that she is very old school and it kind of felt like I was taking a class taught by my mom. Very inclined to talk about her political/personal views every class which got repetitive, tedious, and uncomfortable."
6490,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,3.0,"Great professor. Gives great lectures, and will go in-depth with the chapters. If you study the test reviews, you will definitely pass. Don't miss class and you get graded for that. No Homework."
6491,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,1.0,5.0,Okay so this class was the same time consuming as my chm class have to read over 400 pages of his book + going to class is a must for grades but he doesnt teach at all no lecture &amp; doesnt go over anything for the quizzes or exam till after rather be a home then listen to this guy i Dont recommend him if i wanted that i would of chose online!!
6492,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,4.0,4.0,"I took CLP1006, and overall the professor has a true passion for psychology so because of that he makes the lectures interesting. be reware that you'll be taking 13 quizzes and 4 test, but as long as you are prepared and read the chapter you'll pass."
6493,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"5 tests, each worth the same amount of points. You have about 2-3 weeks in between each tests (depends on how many chapters are in a test) to complete the study guide and finish reading the chapters. The class is very simple psych material all you need is good time management!"
6494,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,1.0,BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! Really down to earth and honest. He opens up new perspectives you should take on in life. His class is more of a conversation than it is a lecture. There's a quiz almost every other class but they're super easy but you HAVE to read. The topics you read about are interesting so it isn't really a hassle.
6495,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"semi easy class, as long as you review the study guide he sends out you will do fine because everything on the study guide is exactly what will be on the test! also attendance is mandatory he gives an extra credit for those who show up everyday. highly recommend this professor he is very good as what he does and very kind"
6496,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY1020,1.0,4.0,He lectures A LOT &amp; his lectures are not based on what will be on the test. You need to read and study on your own or you will not pass. Theres a test every two weeks. 50 questions and they are based on information you should be reading from the book. If you are looking for an easy class this aint it my friends :/
6497,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,1.0,1.0,This professor sucks. The course is easy. You just have to scan the book and do the review and you'll ace quizzes and tests. This professor rambles about random BS in class like Trump and global warming. He never speaks of anything relevant to the course. The class is a joke but just take PSY 2012 with a good professor. You'll actually learn.
6498,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,4.0,"Weekly Quizzes and you have to learn to juggle. Other than that he is a kind professor who wants the best for his students, is open to discussion and opinions. Would 100% take class again"
6499,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,1.0,5.0,He talks a lot but nothing relevant to the actual course.... you have to read and the scoring is very strict.
6500,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,2.0,He is very funny and makes learning fun as well . But if u dont read Im telling you rn YOU WILL FAIL.......
6501,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"He is an amazing professor, very funny and nice to his students, his lessons are long but he gives a review before every tests that contains everything you need, you find the answers in the book or in your notes from class, only five easy tests through the course and thats it, also he is hilarious."
6502,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,2.0,"I loved this professor! His lectures definitely make you think in a new perspective. Make sure you read the chapters, though. If you read you will definitely pass. Also, for the juggling final make It a point to practice and show interest and participate regularly. Hes only difficult if you dont read Or pay attention when hes lecturing"
6503,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,4.0,3.0,Test are easy just read the book.
6504,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,5.0,"Professor Brucato is amazing, he is an expert in his field and it shows in his lectures. There are a lot of tests, but if you go to class,  pay attention and participate hell make sure youll pass. He also offered a huge amount of extra credit for perfect attendance, and he really cares about his students its a hard class  but youll have fun"
6505,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,2.0,4.0,"He's not a BAD teacher. he knows what he's talking about BUT, he's not exactly the best at speaking his mind out without coming off a little harsh and rude. you could have an A and still fail just for your attendance. Test EVERY class. if you like venting about your life, this is the teacher for you cause all he talks about is everyones life."
6506,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,CLP1006,5.0,2.0,Brucato is genuinely a great person. Hes so sweet and cares for you and your grade. Hes also very smart in subjects he teaches. His classes are mostly discussions about stuff from the book and how it relates to our life. Quizzes every other class but you must read book prior to quiz because he doesnt go over the chapter until after the quiz.
6507,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"Professor Brucato is a great professor! He gives you reviews for each test and clearly explains the information in each chapter and tells you what to remember for the test. His tests are easy if you attend class, take some notes, and DO THE REVIEW! And no final! I would definitely take him again."
6508,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"I am currently taking Professor Bruacto for psy and am enjoying it!

You WILL pass by doing this."
6509,263624,Dominic,Brucato,Miami Dade College (all),Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"Great professor and guy, would highly recommend to take him. Always read the book and do the study guides! You are guaranteed to pass if you do just that, and get extra credit for showing up."

BUT don't discourage! Proff. Todd has his own technique to break people out of their shells. He is truly patient and motivates you to speak and cares about the student. He is funny and very sweet, take his class and you'll see."
6526,423717,John,Todd,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1107,5.0,3.0,One of the greatest fears among us people is PUBLIC SPEAKING. Professor Todd helped me feel comfortable and gave honest feed back. Take him and you won't regret it.

6530,423717,John,Todd,Miami Dade College (all),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,1.0,Super smart and chill
6532,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,Easy A if you do all your work. Test are a little hard but easy if you pay attention. Super nice and understanding. Helped me by giving me an extra test after my grade dropped to a B. She only helps people who do all the hw. HW is super long but worth it if you want the A. HW isn't graded but she drops your final Grade by 1 letter if u don't do it.
6533,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,Do yourself a favor a pick another professor
6534,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,4.0,"problem isnt her accent, its the fact that she can't teach and is very messy. I was close to an A and she lost my hw and gave me a 0 for it even tho i did it. I had her during spring and once we went online because of the pandemic she didnt grade things on time. I thought i had an A in the class but i was left with a B even tho i did all the work"
6535,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,2.0,"She's a great teacher, explains &amp; answers questions. Do the HW! Hates phones/computers in her class &amp; you must show your work. Lots of EC opportunities, she's kinda weird but listens as long as you communicate your needs."
6536,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,2.0,"She's really sweet and her class is really easy but, she's extremely disorganized and never tells you when you have a test. I wouldn't take her again for that reason. She gives an extreme amount of homework and doesn't even grade them. She isn't techie at all, which I think its why she makes us use books and she is all over the place."
6537,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"This prof is very disorganized and her accent will not let you understand her. I thought I could  because accents are never a problem for me but no. If she looses an assignment she will doubt that you turned it in and if your lucky shell put in the grade, if not get ready to do it again. In general just no."
6538,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,Probably one of the best professors in MDC. Only problem with class is how long the class is.
6539,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,2.0,"She does give a lot of work but it is relatively easy. The only problem with this teacher is her accent and how she continuously makes mistakes when lecturing, it gets kinda annoying. The only other problem was that she lost one of my papers that were very important but she said she was gonna check. Other than that she should be an easy A."
6540,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"I'm terrible at terrible at math, but this lady is so detailed and explains everything so well. Her details in explaining math is short, but easy for anyone to understand. Her test are open notes, so you can pass at anytime. She so sweet and caring it melts my heart! Take her you won't regret!"
6541,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,3.0,"She's is a real gem. This professor gives everyone a chance at an A, even if you're not the best at math (like me). Trust me taking her is the best decision. If you are interested in learning, get in her class."
6542,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,4.0,"She cares a lot about her students, and will help you out if you show interest in the class. Does give homework from the book, and gives an optional review packet for each test. If you complete the packet then you'll recieve 10 extra points towards your test. Be prepared to participate in class and work for you grade."
6543,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,5.0,"Too much work for this class. You have to complete these huge packages every 2 weeks and turn them in for the tests. On top of doing homework online and 30-question test reviews every week. So 5 huge packets, 5 test reviews, 5 quizzes + final, and online work. People have lives and other classes, full time jobs. On top of disorganized professor."
6544,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,3.0,"Pay attention to MyMathLab instead of her. Going to class is for her to repeat stuff you're already learning on MML. It's a waste of time. Her lectures are ""all over the place"", very disorganized, and she makes mistakes A LOT. She displays really poor planning and has lost test reviews in the past. Terrible @ answering e-mails. She's nice at least."
6545,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,3.0,"Eh. Lectures are kind of all over the place. She's very disorganized and seems to always be in a hurry or stressed out. Accent is very thick and makes it difficult to understand an already hard to understand subject. Make sure to do ALL the extra credits and PARTICIPATE bc she gives points for it, it will definitely help you in the long run."
6546,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,"She knows her math but she confuses herself a lot. She has a very heavy accent so it's hard to understand her at times. The syllabus was confusing both in text and as she explained it. She is nice and it's clear that she cares. However if you're already bad at math, she might not be the best professor."
6547,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"good professor do all homework,packages and have a perfect attendance and you will be ok"
6548,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"ALOT OF HOMEWORK ! lets you use your notes for the tests, very helpful and caring."
6549,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Really good professor, caring about her students and concerned about their development. Definitely I recomend her, :-)."
6550,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"She is awesome, she confuses herself a lot but its no big deal she cares about you understanding &amp; passing. Test are take home or with partners, can use your review, home work, notes &amp; book for the test. And if you do the review&amp;homework is an extra 10 points for your test. There is no way you can fail. She always gives extra points for participate"
6551,968309,Samia,Fernandez,Miami Dade College (all),Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,3.0,This professor is a really good person!! Super nice BUT she doesn't teaches that well. She makes you confunse more and more than normal. I recommend to do not take her if your mayor is consist in Math and You need to really learn math. I past this class with the help of tutoring . Easy A
6553,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,2.0,"He is extremely funny and easy to listen to. His lectures are very interesting since he ties it to real life all the time. I barely had to study due to how good his lectures were (except the first exam, which was vocabulary words). He is also very easy to talk to if you have any problems. I definitely recommend him!"
6554,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,1.0,"This is my second class with prof. Lenel. Any students will do well with quizzes and exams if they pay attention to his lectures. Even though I am a STEM major, with his amazing lectures, I found myself enjoying philosophy and it became my favorite subject. Many philosophers are mathematicians so STEM students also enjoy his class! Thank you!!"
6555,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,2.0,4.0,Professor Lenel is a great person overall. He gives WAYYYY to much work. Writing assignments EVERY week and quizzes EVERY class and an essay question. there's 2 papers due one of 5 pages!!!!
6556,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"TAKE LENEL! He is fantastic. I am not fond of philosophy, but he made the subject easy and interesting. He is detailed and eloquent when he's lecturing. He truly knows what he's talking about. Part of me thinks he's a genius. He's soo kind and his class is REALLY easy as long as you study his powerpoints and listen to him."

6559,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,1.0,"This professor is the best in MDC for PHI. The way he explains the subject is very understanding and he does it so good that just by listening to him you will pass the tests. Super nice. The tests are very easy and not a lot, the homework is in blackboard with five sentence of a topic in class. He is open to questions. You wont regret it!"
6560,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Six multiple choice quizzes with 5 short essay response questions throughout the course, a light mid-term and straight-forward final. There are also 2 papers, and 8 writing assignments on Black Board. He's an empathetic &amp; lenient professor. Just be honest &amp; explain your issue to him. I honestly don't know how people fail with him."
6561,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,3.0,"Philisophy,Philosophy, either you love it or hate it. But one thing is certain, Professor Lenel makes it interesting and time flies when you're in his class. Study the power points for exams and you're good to go!"
6562,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,2.0,"Yes, if you're questioning taking him as a proffesor do it, you will not regret it. He makes the class in the beggining seem like its too much work lots of quizzes but oh my god the quizzes are so easy! and i'm really lazy in studying so for me to say that it's rare. He explains everything so clear, he's caring andvery attentive to the students."
6563,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, makes lectures very clear. He repeats what he says a lot, which becomes pretty redundant but it helps you remember the material. Many quizzes which include essays, a midterm, a final, and two papers. He's pretty lenient on grading the essays that come along with the quizzes as well as the two papers, just follow the given format."
6564,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2406,5.0,2.0,Lenel was great and his anecdotes really help you understand the subject. There are quizzes every 2 weeks but if you study you'll be fine. You don't need the textbook unless you want more information.
6565,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,5.0,4.0,"Professor Lenel is a class act. He is professional, inspirational and teaches by talking about his own life experiences, which makes the class entertaining, in order to relate to his students.

6567,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2010,5.0,1.0,"He is the best professor at MDC so far because he is well mannered. It is very difficult to find a teacher who can teach or act properly. I appreciate his proper manner as a professor. I recommend students especially for female students to take his class. I will take his Ethics course and it will be my final general education class. Thank you, Y"
6568,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,2.0,4.0,"Six quizzes with essays, one midterm with an essay and one final test with an essay, now add this, the homeworks and the research papers, one of 2 pages and the other of 5 pages.

6570,683787,Albert,Lenel,Miami Dade College (all),Philosophy,PHI2604,4.0,4.0,"Professor Lenel is a sweetheart. My class was once a week and 3 hour long lectures. Takes advantage of the time and teaches what he has to teach. Interesting stories and gave us a lot of hw, 5 page research paper and quiz with an essay every class. EASY if you study for the quizzes, I passed with a B just because I didn't do the research paper."

6574,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1025,5.0,2.0,"Best chem professor! He made chemistry very fun and easy to learn. As long as you study, you will pass the class.

6576,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1025,1.0,2.0,His lectures are super boring and long. Very unprofessional. You will get an easy A but you will not learn anything from him.
6577,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1025,5.0,3.0,"Please study. I couldve passed with an A if I study but I got a B+ instead. The professor does not delete the lowest score so every mistake counts against you. However, this is still a great teacher!"

6579,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,5.0,3.0,Chemistry is not an easy subject and it is indeed intimidating but MAN professor Duarte makes it crystal clear. At first glance the power points seem confusing but as soon as he starts explaining things you begin to understand the material. He will help you as long as you approach him.
6580,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1025,5.0,2.0,Prof. Duarte is hands down my favorite professor that I've had since beginning my education here at MDC.

6581,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,5.0,3.0,"Ralph Duarte is one of the most amazing professors I have had to date.

6582,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,5.0,2.0,"No doubt the best chem professor! Great person, cares about his students and is accessible outside the classroom.

6583,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,5.0,3.0,"Professor Duarte is the best professor I've ever had. He really cares about his students. He comes 30 minutes earlier and will stay after class to answer any questions you have. There's 2 tests, a midterm and a final. He also gives you a work assignment that is similar to a study guide for tests. If you study even a little bit you'll pass."
6584,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,5.0,2.0,"Professor Duarte is seriously amazing! Chem is a scary subject to many, but he makes is plain simple and oddly enough, fun. I would say this professor is one of the best that MDC has.

6585,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,5.0,2.0,"He only uses ppts but goes in depth and explains everything very well. He gets to class an hour early and he helps with the HW and gives everyone the answers. Only 2 work assignments all term. Cares a lot about his students.

6590,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1033,5.0,1.0,"I was very cautious entering chemistry, there has been rumors of people taking the class twice and even three times. My experience with Professor Duarte was the contrary. He is absolutely amazing and patient, he is willing to educate and take time after class to further discuss topics. I recommend him to everyone having to take chem!"
6591,900848,Ralph,Duarte,Miami Dade College (all),Chemistry,CHM1033,5.0,4.0,Great professor. However you must study to pass the class. Professor is always willing to help you understand.

But do not think you can get away with not doing work, you will fail"
6597,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2303,5.0,4.0,There are few professors at MDC SOA Kendall campus that really look after us (students) to make sure that we not only pass their classes but finish the very hard and tiring mission on becoming an Architect in today's society. Professor Mario Ortega is without a doubt the most caring and helpfull professor at MDC SOA Kendall today.
6598,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2303,2.0,2.0,"If you can come up with ideas, if you can think, if you have natural talent, if you want to know what design really is, take a real professor. If not, take this guy, be another follower copying/pasting someone elses language/ideas. Get ready for pre-developed designs, look at the project next to yours, its the same. Theres more than cool stuff."
6599,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2303,5.0,3.0,"Best architecture professor, in a few words if you want to be an average architecture student take someone else , if like competency , taking challenges if you want to be the best ,take D1-D4 classes. You will remember this comment for the rest of your career ."
6600,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC23032304,5.0,5.0,Facts no resentful comments. Ortegas studios are not easy; they require hard work discipline dedication. Ortega prepares you for upper division and the practice. After MDC my classmates &amp; I were admitted to: FIU UM UF USF SCI-arc Cornell for grad school we were admitted to Harvard SCI-arc UPenn VT Ortegas lessons were vital to achieve our goals.
6601,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2301,5.0,4.0,"Ortega is the only professor in MDC that truly cares about his students. His knowledge and work in and out of MDC speaks volume as he makes sure you understand the concept and the purpose of each project being assigned. Sure it's a lot of work, but in the end, it will all be worth it once you get your acceptance letter to your dream school. Trust."
6602,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC1302,2.0,3.0,"Nobody gets A+ at MDC. That said its funny how all these people owe everything to him and are seated on some cheap pride that he built for them. Talking about lectures and knowledge when yyour best friend will be Youtube. Its ridiculous how people believe they deserve it. Just take him, dont pay attention to this review and lets see."
6603,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC1302,1.0,3.0,"All you need to do is whatever he says, and dont whatever he says not to do even if he does it all the time. Behave like a 10 years old kid, laugh at all his jokes and maybe you will be those who can bring the work a week later smelling like fresh glue. Easy A. Dont get too stressed, even if you work for the C you will get an A. Thank me later."

I felt more in love with Architecture because of this amazing professor. If you take architecture serious and wanna be better take it him."
6606,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2304,5.0,4.0,"want to become a successful architect in the future? don't look anywhere else.

His lectures provides you with a strong foundation for the future. Great professor."
6608,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2304,5.0,4.0,"Usually, you won't find professors that will dedicate their heart and soul toward your education, Prof. Ortega is one of those. Design classes are always challenging and his is no exception. Hell make you work to your limits and put 200% into every project. If you decide to put that hard work, you will see the rewards now and in your future."
6609,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2304,5.0,4.0,"Prepare for nights without sleep and to work hard. I register for his design classes and thanks to him, I got accepted into all the four top universities of my choice including Cornell University and SCI-ARC, all with scholarships. Taking his design courses was the best decision I could have made."
6610,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC1302,5.0,4.0,"Professor Ortega is the best architecture professor at MDC. If you want to be professional take him. You are going to learn. Obviously, you need patience and effort. If you want an easy class dont take him."
6611,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC2304,5.0,4.0,"I am proud of how much I have accomplished since I started Design 2 with him. He is an exceptional educator, and human being, willing to help you succeed and rise in this competitive career. The amount of work and research done in his class is challenging, but it is worth the hard work. He makes you think, analyze, and design."
6612,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,D1D2D3D4,5.0,4.0,"he is my inspiration, best architectural design professor! very simple, do your work! it will truly help you in your future. This guy will show you what architecture really is, he'll give you instructions for you to come up with your own design, not like other professors that will make you build a model of a building thats already built."
6613,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC1302,1.0,1.0,"This professor is ok when you are on his good side, meaning do things for him like attending his event and follow his model design but once you start making your own choices Mario will penalize you and not grade you base on skill but on his personal opinion. I dont recommend him but unfortunately Mdc has him on a high standards."
6614,422107,Mario,Ortega,Miami Dade College (all),Architecture,ARC1301,5.0,5.0,He is hard but he is amazing
6616,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,2.0,He was an awesome professor! Super energetic and animated!!
6617,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,4.0,"This professor is great but there are 2 big problems I had to overcome in this class. 1. There are fill in questions that you have to remember the weird names and random dates from on the exams. 2. The book he requires is scatter-brained and I could barely understand it let alone memorize important events. Nice guy, class is hard."
6618,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST39,5.0,5.0,"WARNING: There is a lot of work to do such as heavy in reading, studying, and memorizing maps which is a huge pain in the butt. He is extremely test heavy. Although I don't believe many would like his class, I liked his class because to me he made lectures like storytelling so it was easier to digest history."
6619,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST39,1.0,5.0,can't believe this guy is serious
6620,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST39,4.0,4.0,"He is a very easy going professor but requires a lot of your own personal effort in order to pass. Make sure to pay attention to the study guides since they are practically the entire test. And dont be too hard on yourself for the essay questions, as long as you know what youre talking about youll be fine."
6621,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST7,1.0,5.0,He really makes the class harder than it needs to be
6622,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST7,1.0,5.0,Difficult and lots of work.
6623,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST7,1.0,5.0,Very messy class schedule... He keeps changing the syllabus drastically which really throws me off as a student and also cancelled an entire week of class without notice.
6624,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST7,1.0,5.0,"Unfortunately, I had to drop with a W but tbh it was worth the W... Worked and read all the way up to week 7 but my deciding factor was that I couldn't keep up this pace for a full 16 weeks :( Way too much reading and convoluted instructions from the professor take too much from my life force lol."
6625,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST39,1.0,5.0,Oh my goodness he reminds me of some of the worst high school teachers I've had.
6626,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST39,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Hoffman is kind of obnoxious but still a pretty nice guy. There's a LOT of material that he'll give you, but don't be overwhelmed! Follow his directions, do the reading, study, and you'll pass. You WILL have to work for your grade, but he provides you with everything you need to succeed. Make sure you're willing to put in the time and effort!"
6627,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST39,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful teacher he made the class enjoyable, he has that passion for his subject hat a lot o teachers dont have. Id take his class again"
6628,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,4.0,"He scares away many of his students on the first day, because he gives you PACKETS of info. All of which is useful, but nevertheless intimidating. I consider myself to be pretty disciplined when studying, but the tests were ROUGH. You make your own grade. He's a great professor, you just need to put in work. I have a belief only the smartest pass."
6629,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS1,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor!!! I recommend him to anyone who will take a history class!! Hands down with his lectures, very knowledgeable and most important of all he makes it fun for all. I compared him to Robin Williams, great sense of humor. His teaching techniques will help you remember the material and not be bored with lectures! By far BEST PROF I HAD!"
6630,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,3.0,4.0,"This professor makes you really work for it. This class requires textbooks that are very hard to understand and a novel that you must read on your own time and write two essays for. The test consist of 10 one word free response, 5 paragraphs on Who,What,Where,When,Why that must be memorized, and lastly an essay that also must be memorized."
6631,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS1,1.0,5.0,I dropped his class and got a withdrawal but don't take him regardless of what everyone says he is a hardass and you will fail on the tests. Beware of fill ins and essay questions.
6632,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST16,4.0,5.0,Professor Hoffman is kind of an ass but a pretty amazing teacher. Almost all of the assignments are written and he is a tough grader but He gives great lectures and is more than willing to help improve your grade. Definitely would take him for another class
6633,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST16,5.0,5.0,"He expects a lot of his students but you definitely get back what you put in. If you're just looking to fill a GE requirement and are looking for an easy ""A"" stay away  from this class. If you are looking for a fun challenging course where the professor will invest in you if you show effort take it. I am a better writer and student because of this"
6634,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST7,2.0,5.0,"Oh my god. Are you ready? I think not. If you are willing to take this class please make sure you have it together. If you deal with any kind of mental health issue such as depression DO NOT take this class. Do not do that to yourself. On one hand, he is a pretty decent professor and his lectures are always entertaining. On the downside, he expects WAY too much. True, he gives you everything you need to know, but that everything is too much to handle if you plan to take any other class. He gives out like a million handouts and expects you to know everything off of them. Brace yourselves."
6635,1481619,Harlan,Hoffman,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,4.0,"Toughest history class ever. You really have to work for your grade. Reading is ESSENTIAL to getting the grade you want! Follow the study guide and you are good. Learned a lot though &amp; he is very entertaining in lecture! Test: 10 fill in the blank, 5 identifications (1 paragraph each), 1 essay (gives 3 prompts ahead of time, 2 will show up)"
6637,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,4.0,She is great. Has a great personality and makes sure you understand everything. Lots of homework but it helps you study for the exams. Dont cheat on hw! It will help you later on!! And go to office hours for one on one.
6638,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH11,4.0,1.0,"Math 11 class is supposed to help students with learning challenges in statistics. We get help from the professor, college tutors, and classmates. All was good until the college shutdown. Math 11 became a drudge. If we didn't get statistics before the shutdown, the absence of face-to-face meetups made it crazy. Some students need more support."
6639,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,2.0,Professor Johnson is an amazing professor!! I took her the short six week semester in the winter and can honestly say she's great! Some people learn quickly and others don't and she takes her time teaching everyone equally! She doesn't rush through lectures!
6640,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,4.0,4.0,"2 exams, 2 big quizzes &amp; a cumulative final which replaces your lowest test score when hw &gt; 70%. Theres only 6 hw assignments but they can take a while. She gives an extra credit assignment after the drop date. No pop quizzes! A lot of students had taken her for other math classes. Sweet lady &amp; I would take her again"
6641,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,3.0,"You must take her, I really struggled in math but she helped me a lot. She is so sweet she treats you like if you were her kid. Lots of homework but it helps you with the tests. You wont regret taking her."
6642,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51A,5.0,1.0,"She is the best math teacher I have ever had. She cares about her students and wants every one of them to succeed. Do the homework right away, it is a lot of homework, but it will prepare you for the exams. She gives study guides before the exam that are SUPER helpful."
6643,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Johnson is the best math teacher in the world! I failed math 50 three times and I lost all hope until I jumped to math 51 and I passed with flying colors because Mrs. Johnson truly cares about her students and she makes sure that we understand. I hated math but I loved her class I will take her again.
6644,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH50,3.0,3.0,She is very easy to talk to and a great person overall. BUT her classes are very lecture heavy and she speeds through lessons very fast. I managed to keep up but that was the worst part of the class. She has never taken a day off so attendance is super important.
6645,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,4.0,2.0,"lots of hw, but hw only 10% of total grade. so doing well on tests are important, but you will only do well if you do hw! go to every class and do all HW, tests won't be so hard. prof is nice, organized, knows math well, helpful. don't cheat on hw, take time to learn material. accepts late hw for partial credit and final replaces lowest test score"
6646,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71B,5.0,3.0,Professor Johnson is the best math professor I've had so far. She makes lectures fun and exciting. She goes over tests and quizzes in depth and helps students understand what they did wrong and why it was wrong. Take her if you have the chance.
6647,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,2.0,"I just took her for math 130 (college algebra) and is a really easy class to pass. Your grade is mostly based on test, but as long as you attend class, do hw, ask Q's, attend office hrs, &amp; do practice exam problems that she assigns (are optional) you are fine! She does offer extra credit. Use your time wisely because she does offer alot of hw."
6648,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,3.0,Best math Professor I've ever had in all my years of math from high school to now. I was never the brightest at math but she made me rethink my own insecurities and now I can confidently do a lot of math! She does everything to help you get an A. There is a lot of homework but I believe it is worth it just to sit in her class 2x a week.
6649,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,2.0,3.0,Gives tooo much homework for little time and credit! Shes very nice though although I get lost at times in the lecture.
6650,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,3.0,Literally the best math teacher Ive ever had. Does everything she can to help you pass. Nice. Approachable. Funny. Brings candy to class. Does reviews RIGHT before tests. Gives lots of partial credit. Wont make you buy an expensive calculator and will teach you how to use yours if you dont know. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!!!
6651,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,3.0,"Professor Johnson is amazing. She explains everything clearly, and will take the time during class to go over material you may not understand. She is a great educator and her teaching style breaks all the material down in easily digestible parts. Do the homework. Even if it doesn't count for much, it is an easy grade booster."
6652,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,2.0,Michelle Johnson is my favorite professor EVER! She is so kind hearted and so easy! She really cares about her students and she teaches very well. Her study guides are exactly like her test. She reminds me of Monica fromm F.R.I.E.N.D.S LOL!!
6653,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,5.0,"Extremely difficult class &amp; I struggled the entire semester; however, I worked really hard and with many office visits I managed to exceed my own expectations. Memorize the formulas and you'll do good.  So much I could say about professor J. but I'll leave you with this:  I am lucky to of crossed her path, she is simply an amazing person!"
6654,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,3.0,3.0,Gives way to much homework
6655,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,3.0,4.0,"She is VERY nice, funny, and helps a lot after class. That being said, she rushes through ch 1-3 so it's very easy to get behind. Since you rush the beginning, ch 5,7 are doable. The professor is nice but I have NEVER had to work so hard in any class before and I'm transferring. I highly advise reviewing the book before class starts. Not an easy A."
6656,1479429,Michelle,Johnson,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,4.0,Really great professor! very willing to help and entertaining. Definitely do the homework and pay attention. She's flexible and understands the student life so she is willing to accommodate your needs.  I am very appreciative of the way she conducts class because i failed my first attempt at 130 and that prof was mean but she is kind and awesome!.
6658,1500617,John,Brantingham,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1CH,5.0,2.0,"Professor Brantingham genuinely cares for his students.

6688,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC1AH,4.0,4.0,"I took this class during COVID pandemic. Smooth transition and really cared for our well-being. A discussion once a week, about 4 tests, and one research paper &amp; powerpoint. you'll need the textbook for certain assignments and sometimes tests. this was the most interactive online class I've ever taken and I highly recommend taking her!"
6689,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC3,5.0,4.0,"Every student in Psyc 3 got a passing grade during the cv19 transition to online class, and nobody dropped. She was super available for questions, and the lectures were recorded so you could watch them whenever you wanted. Lot of group work made things easier and there was a lot of extra credit. You could pass without the book, take good notes."
6690,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYCH3,5.0,3.0,I respectfully disagree with my spring 2020 Psyc3 classmates' review. Dr. K was outstanding during the covid-crisis w/ fair standards during the transition to online learning. The class was held Asynchronistically with direct instruction held in weekly zoom meetings that were elective attendance. We also had an embedded tutor in class to help us
6691,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC1AH,5.0,4.0,"One of the best profs I've had at Mt Sac! Very clear with assignments and deadlines, very fast grader, and replies to email super fast. We had to go online halfway through, and i was nervous, but she was always there to support us. She's funny too! You can get an A but you do have to work for it!"
6692,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC3H,5.0,4.0,Dr K was awesome during this pandemic. It was obvious she did her best to adapt to going online mid-semester. Tough semester overall (obviously) but Dr K made it bearable and I learned a ton. She really cares and always replies quickly to emails. Great professor!
6693,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC3H,2.0,4.0,Wasn't an easy A. No clear grading criteria for many assignments. Didn't teach SPSS well. (I don't feel prepared for transfer classes). Lectures are ok. Exam review sheets weren't helpful at all. Recommend reading text &amp; taking good lecture notes. Peers who took psych10 said it helped set the foundation for this class &amp; they had an 'easier' time.
6694,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC3H,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor I've ever had. MANY glaring inconsistencies b/w her provided samples, assignment instructions, and feedback. Get ready to teach yourself everything! Not a reliable professor. I HIGHLY recommend taking PSYC10 with Prof Balcksher before taking this class! Only reason I got that A. Be smart who you choose to work with for group work!"
6695,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC1AH,3.0,3.0,"She's fine i guess. Very reachable during the transition. She has a 1000 point grading system but offers multiple assignments and extra credit opportunities to fulfill it. She requires Psych in Life assignments, workshop reviews, and a final research paper + video presentation. Textbook was useless though since the exams relied on her PowerPoints."
6696,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYCH1A,5.0,3.0,This prof was great! Almost every time I emailed her she got back within literally 5 minutes and if not 5 then at least the hour! Super helpful! You do need to read the book though so dont try to take this class without doing that. Also only one paper the whole semester which was great
6697,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSCH1A,4.0,2.0,"Mrs.K cares a lot for her students and clearly loves the subject of psychology. As long as you use the study guides she gives, you will do good on the tests. The chapter homework it very tedious and time-consuming, so you can ask to do flash cards because it will save you lots of time! As long as you show up and do the work, you'll do solid!"
6698,1479722,Misty,Kolchakian,Mt. San Antonio College,Psychology,PSYC1A,5.0,1.0,"By far the best online class I've taken so far! If you do the assignments &amp; DB, you will EASILY pass. There are two tests (midterm &amp; final) but extra credit brings up your grade very easily. I highly recommend taking this class, Professor Kolchakian is caring, passionate, and accommodating!"
6700,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10B,1.0,4.0,"Dont take her!! She doesnt teach a thing. She just gives out some Powepoint which covers 40% materials on the exam. Expecting you to read and study your own. No lecture zoom No recorded videos. She teaches you basic stuff, but test you in specific things with her confusing wording. I cant warn you enough."
6701,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10,5.0,4.0,"Beta Meyer is a real gem and asset to Mt Sac, she is extremely kind and caring and truly wants you pass the class with learning and obtaining new ways to understand Anatomy! she is my second anatomy professor and by far the best one around! her class is NOT easy but no anatomy is! she is helpful and willing to go over anything and everything twice!"
6702,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,4.0,"Amazing professor! Not an easy subject, but Beta is super caring and wants everyone to do well! Shes laid back and is completely open to questions and explains everything in ways that are relatable! Brings snacks for her students and is willing to put in extra time to help you pass! A lot of studying is key, but she teaches the material well!"
6703,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,4.0,"Probably the best professor Ive had at Mt. Sac. She is very sweet and explains things well. If you don't understand she is happy to go over it again with you. Make sure to put in the effort and you will do fine. Ended with an A after taking her for winter session, you won't regret taking her."
6704,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,5.0,"Shes a really good teacher and easy to listen to, but shes expecting us to know a lot of information. I took this class in einter so it was accelerated, but nonetheless you need to study and work hard to know the material. Its lots of new concepts and memorization, but if you can keep up and dont miss class youll pass"
6705,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,3.0,"By far the most amazing anatomy professor she is really in making sure everybody knows the material, understands the material so that everyone can pass! She is so sweet"
6706,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,3.0,"Fantastic professor! Of course ANAT is a tough course but Beta provides so many resources, it is up to you to hit or miss. Aside from the textbook, Beta provides lecture slide notes, EC on exams and in class, and tons of goodies (cheez its mmm). Labs are not too bad, just memorization and provides slides of models and cats on canvas. 5 for Beta!"
6707,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,4.0,"Professor Beta is hands down the most caring teacher I've ever had. Though you do have to work for it, she is quite reasonable. Gives you more than enough chances to succeed. She can be a bit broad at times with what she wants you to study, but she makes up for it with extra credit. She also brings tons of snacks on test days."
6708,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,3.0,"Solid teacher. Lectures are based on powerpoint. She provides packets that include the sides, HW, and old test/quiz questions. You have to read outside of the class to be able to get an A on her tests. The lecture is mostly memorization and some concepts to understand. The lab is completely memorizing things. She provides extra credit and snacks."
6709,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10,5.0,4.0,"Takes the time to explain what is really important to know, why and why not. Helpful and wants students to get it. She is GREAT!!! Not an easy class, but o your work and it's doable."
6710,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,4.0,"P. Beta is always on campus and is probably the most kind-hearted professor at Mt. SAC, she really cares and loves her students. Seek tutoring from the STEM center and her weekly in-class tutoring. It's a lot of course material to learn, never cram for her tests. It gets fun as the semester goes on! She brings snacks during lecture days (:"
6711,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,3.0,"She is a great professor and her tests are very straight forward. The hardest portion of this class is usually the practicums (50-100 questions), which are fill in the blank. Most of her lecture contests consist of matching questions, like 6 questions with an answer key of 6, all of which are 1:1 so it is extremely easy."
6712,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,10A,1.0,5.0,"During lecture she gives very broad teaching of the subject, and the tests are very specific. You need to teach yourself because what she teaches is not related to what she tests you on. I feel like Im teaching myself the subject and shes just there to hand out a test and a grade. Ive done good in all other science classes, except this one so far."
6713,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10,5.0,4.0,"Great professor,  she care about students  I really enjoyed her lecture."
6714,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,2.0,5.0,super sweet lady but extremely unorganized. She's always there for you if you need the help but this class is extremely difficult because of the unorganization. You'll learn completely different things in lecture and lab even though they are supposed to correspond. It seems like more of a physiology class
6715,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,10A,5.0,4.0,"Took during Winter course; lots of studying but doable! Lectures are straight to the point and she gives you the slides which are great to add notes on. You won't need the textbook. Lots of EC opportunities and drops the lowest exam. Take advantage of the STEM center &amp; coaching as it helps a lot. Great professor overall, I'd take her again!"
6716,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,3.0,Took during winter and was  a very difficult class but put in the work and you will have no problem passing. Amazing teacher
6717,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,3.0,"Show up to the classes. You'll miss a lot if you skip class, especially lab. Study the notes and you should be fine for the tests. Read the book if you really don't understand a topic, but it isn't necessary. Visit the STEM center and use online resources for lab practicums. Do at least 10 HW assignments and quizzes shouldn't be hard if you study."
6718,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,4.0,"Heavy lectures, but its ANAT so what do you expect. Really cares for her students. Shes been doing this for a long time so she knows exactly how to teach the material. Many opportunities for extra credit. Drops lowest lab test, chooses best 10 of 15 quizzes and best 10 of 15 HW assignments. Many are group quizzes. Make sure to study."
6719,1476874,Elizabeta,Meyer,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10A,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Beta Meyer is a great inspirational professor, clear straight to the point. Read your PowerPoints, take notes. Don't skip class, visit the STEM center for Lab. Remember everything about this class for life because it's about you and your body!"
6721,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,5.0,5.0,"HW heavy via Mymathlab. 4 Exams, 2 Finals. He will make you work for it. Study your eyes out. You will need to if you want to pass."
6722,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,3.0,"Kambiz is very passionate about Math and truly wants his students to succeed. Very entertaining lectures, good sense of humor. Does require alot of hw but manage your time wisely &amp; you can definitely get it done. Is confusing during lecture but there are video notes in the website we use for hw that explain things simply. Test are much tougher."
6723,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,5.0,2.0,He's SO KIND AND ACCESSIBLE. He would literally even do zoom conferences when its not 'official' office hours to help you with any problems you have before the exam. TRULY CARES FOR HIS STUDENTS.
6724,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,4.0,2.0,"Not only is he extremely kind, but also goes out of his way to help his students. His exams are very very similar to the homework. He has his own lecture notes, which are really helpful. He does grade attendance, so make sure to go to class. He offers extra credit for going to the MARC."
6725,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,3.0,"Whoever struggles in math, please take him. Kambiz is very understanding of problems and very patient if you don't understand a problem. One can genuinely tell he enjoys teaching, every time I asked him for helo, he would take the time to explain it slower to me, and the more i would understand, he would get happy. You will not regret taking him"
6726,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH50,5.0,3.0,"Very solid professor, will take the time to explain what even one person doesn't understand. Very caring and understanding of students. Has a good energy throughout class, which helps a ton in a lecture-heavy subject. Gives extra credit for going to the math lab. Gives plenty of material to use in case you didn't understand. Can't ask for any more."
6727,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,4.0,4.0,"!!!! PLEASE take kambiz!! i struggle with math and i passed the class with a B!!! he makes the hw due when we have an exam!!! theres 3 quiz and 3 exams, when i first read the syllabus i wanted to drop lol but he made the class cool. please take him!!!"
6728,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MAT71,4.0,3.0,Kambiz was one of the best professors Ive taken yet! Hes hilarious and wants to make sure all his student understand the subject. Hw is a medium amount but is due the day of tests. He explains different ways to execute a math problem. He wants to make sure everyone does math in a comfortable way not just one way. Highly recommend!
6729,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH50,5.0,3.0,Professor Kambiz is such a good professor! I struggle with math and honestly I was so happy to take MATH50 with him. He does assign HW assignments and he gives you plenty of time to finish. One key for passing this class is HW. Most of the homework is what he tests you on. Quizes and Tests ect. FUNNY GUY!!
6730,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,1.0,1.0,take him for anything but MATH 150. i took himm for 51 and 71. he was decent. Math 150 he makes it soo hard please dont add him hes not worth it. paid 150 dollars for one book. and that book cant be used in the tmarc
6731,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,2.0,"Professor Khoddam is an amazing, laid-back teacher. He wants you to be engaged and ask the questions when you don't get something. He loves to give good grades, and may ask the class what questions they would like to see on tests. Extra Credit  MARC hours. He doesn't force you to do daily HW, but if you want to do well, try not to procrastinate."
6732,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH160,4.0,4.0,"Overall Kambiz was a solid teacher. The class was full of lecture and he goes a bit fast. Expects you to know the material. Pretty funny guy and uses funky phrases that keeps you awake. A bit of a lot of homework, but he only checks for completion. Tests were pretty hard but he gives a TON of extra credit. 2 points for every 1 hour in the TMARC."
6733,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH113,3.0,3.0,"Although Kambiz has a heavy accent, he is a great professor. As long as you pay attention to his lectures you will understand the material. Make sure to go to his office hours if you need help because he is very helpful. He has two types of homework: online/offline. He collects the offline hw at the end of the class, so you can do it during class."
6734,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH120,5.0,2.0,One of the best professor I've ever had so far. He was patient with students who weren't able to follow up the lesson and many extra credits were provided. I have never felt like I've learned a lot from a math class before. You just have to participate in class and you will learn naturally.
6735,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MAT130,2.0,4.0,"Honestly his teaching was confusing. I was so upset because the tests were really hard, despite being at the tmarc for hours on end and even going to the office hours I still FAILED every single test and quiz. I did all the homework and the extra credit, but got an F in the class. Unless you're good with math, then you can pass."
6736,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,2.0,3.0,"If math is a subject you struggle in or it has been a while since you took your previous course, I do not recommend this professor.  It has been a year since my trig class and even on the first day I was completely lost.  He lectures too fast and is at times hard to understand. You will have to teach yourself."
6737,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,3.0,"Has a bit of an accent, but it's not too bad. He does use the textbook for homework, but he doesn't assign too much of a heavy workload. He collects homework the day of exams, each packet worth 20pts. There are 3 tests and 3 quizzes. An answer key is uploaded after each quiz and exam. Extra credit is offered.  Beware of the final exam, it was hard."
6738,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,2.0,He is a great professor he explains really good and is always available after or before class.  He also give you extra credit and is a great person.
6739,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH120,4.0,4.0,"Kambiz is an awesome professor. I do not like math at all, but he explained lessons well. Homework is out of the textbook so make sure you complete it. Offers extra credit for hours at the TMARC. Will explain anything you don't understand if you ask questions. Very approachable professor."
6740,1478788,Kambiz,Khoddam,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,4.0,3.0,"Kambiz is a very knowledgeable professor. He does tend to lecture a bit fast and he might assume that you know certain things, so be prepared to get a little lost. Just make sure you do the homework because the quizzes and tests are literally straight from there. If you skip class, make sure you review the material that was taught that day. Study!!"
6742,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Jones is one of the most genuine, friendly, and helpful professors I've had. Since Coronavirus this past semester, all lectures and assignments were 100% on Canvas (subject to change), but he was exceptionally communicative (no confusion about exam material) and very understanding about due dates. Highly recommended even w/o class time��"
6743,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,5.0,3.0,I love this man.
6744,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST7,5.0,3.0,"5/5 Jones has an amazing youthful vigor that makes every lecture very entertaining. He is very helpful and approachable, and every essay and exam gives you a variety of topics to choose from that you like best. I have never felt like coming to a class would be fun before taking Jones', that should say enough"
6745,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST4HIST7,4.0,1.0,"The only homework assigned were three essays, which weren't very difficult. Only three tests as well, which were also quite easy. You had to define five terms and answer two short essay questions. You have to show up to class, but his lectures aren't bad. Notes are not needed as he hands out his own lecture notes."
6746,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,5.0,3.0,Jones is the only professor I've given a 5 in my 2 years here. His vast knowledge of US history paired with his dry humor (first time I've ever found a professor genuinely hilarious) and engaging style of lecturing where he mixes in relevant and often funny stories and personal experiences makes class fun and informative. Confidently recommend.
6747,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,5.0,4.0,"I would definitely take this class if you are a social science major! He knows his stuff and enjoys passing on that knowledge. 3 essays and 3 tests, including the final. He is a tough grader, but is not harsh and wants to see you improve. Attendance isn't mandatory. Books he requires are cheap finds."
6748,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST3,4.0,4.0,"This guy's awesome! Loves history, fun clase! Grades really hard though so be prepared, hang with it and you'll learn a lot and have a great Time.."
6749,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,3.0,4.0,"Professor Jones has not been my favorite professor but he isn't the worst either. You can tell he loves his history. Hard grader but he is encouraging as well. Doesn't take attendance. 3 papers in total (only based on 1 chapter of the book), 3 tests which consist of two essays and 5 definitions. If you study for the tests then it'll be easy."
6750,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,3.0,5.0,"Did not enjoy but tbh really weak in history. Would recommend if you're actually interested in history. He's really passionate in the subject and makes lectures somewhat interesting. Otherwise if you're looking for an ez class, find someone else. 2 tests and final. 3 papers. All essay tests."
6751,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,1.0,"Amazing History professor, he is obviously incredibly passionate and loves what he does. You can miss class (he doesn't really take attendance) but he helps you understand the material for quiz and test questions."
6752,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,USHISTORY,5.0,3.0,"the most amazing professor! ive always loved history but bill really made me fall in love with history all over again. not much notes were provided but the way he gives lectures really made me learn and always so interesting and i wouldnt forget the info. i enjoyed this class so much it never felt like work, easiest A ive ever received."
6753,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,4.0,"he's very passionate about history, and is a great, caring professor. make sure to take plenty of notes and do your reading."
6754,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,5.0,4.0,"The sweetest, most caring professor ever! One of the best I've ever had."
6755,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,2.0,"I loved Prof. Jones' class! Not only was he funny and had amazing lectures, but you can really tell he cares about his students. He never blind sides you on tests or quizzes. He will tell you exactly what you should study. No hw just some reading."
6756,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST4,5.0,4.0,"I loved Prof. Jones' class. I never thought I enjoyed history class until I had his. It was tough and heavy reading (do not take this class unless you are prepared to read massive amounts of material), but he is a very fair grader and  gives you partial credit for what you do know. His lectures are very interesting. Highly recommended."
6757,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,2.0,He's an amazing professor. If I had the chance to take him again I would.
6758,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST4,4.0,3.0,He was a nice professor. He had good lectures and had interesting topics. He has 3 tests and 3 essays and no hw
6759,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST4,2.0,4.0,Nice guy but teaching methods are pretty bad. His powerpoints would be considered useless to a normal student. They're not really organized either. It's hard to even take notes on what he is saying cause the content seems all over the place.
6760,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,5.0,1.0,Hes a very great professor he tells you what to expect on the quizzes and on the test. He gives you study guides and provides the lecture notes online so you can print them so you wont be copying everything down when he lectures so you can just listen. He doesn't give you homework he just expects you to read the books he assigned.
6761,1478052,William D.,Jones,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST1,4.0,3.0,"There are a few quizzes, 2 midterms and a final. There is no homework assignments, your homework is to read, I barely cracked open the book and still passed because his lectures covered what you needed to know. The tests and quizzes aren't multiple choice, you write out your answers giving you a chance to show what you know not what you don't. "
6763,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1AENG1C,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor ! One of the luckiest students of having him twice, so caring about his students, understandable. As long you do your work its an easy A and if you have questions or need help feel free to reach out to him he absolutely makes you feel like home."
6764,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,3.0,"Gives extra credit. For our research paper he had us split it up and write half the paper at first and then finish the rest by the next week, so we did multiple drafts which was super helpful. You just gotta do the work. He's really lenient I feel like. 4 essays including research paper. Easy final, we could bring a paper w/ the whole outline of it"
6765,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,LIT36,5.0,2.0,"one of the best English professors at mt. sac. he is hilarious and really cares about his students. only three essays and one final. the prompts are kind of confusing, but he is always accessible after class and will walk you step by step to ensure you an A on the essay. he drops lowest exam grade and offers extra credit you which really helps"
6766,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,LIT36,5.0,4.0,"Professor Enke is the best. He is very passionate about what he teaches and likes to make a lot of wise cracks to make sure you're engaged. I'm not going to lie and say it's an easy class, but he does make you interested in the lecture. I went in to learn about mythology and I leave his class with an existential crisis too early for an 8 am."
6767,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,5.0,5.0,"By far, Toughest Prof I've had. But 10/10 would take again. He deff makes you work for your grade.

I have taken him for two semesters now and Ill be taking him again for English 1C. If youre intimidated by the subject, I suggest you take him. He will challenge you but at the end of the day it all pays off."
6769,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,4.0,3.0,"Professor Enke is literally a blessing. He is caring and charismatic. He gives amazing feedback when grading your essay.

There are pop up quizzes on the readings that are assigned, but they are easy if you do the reading. Grades are mainly based on your essays. Show up to class (on time ) do your readings, do your essays and you will be golden !"
6772,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,3.0,3.0,"Enke is a good professor. Just beware that he will kick you out of class if you don't show up with the assign textbook or paper and if you don't attend regularly to lectures he will drop you, so attendance is a must! In my experience, I felt that Enke does not give enough good feedbacks. He said my writing is good but my essays were graded poorly."
6773,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,5.0,3.0,Best English Professor I've ever had. Makes class fun and interacts with students well. Offers extra credit. Lots of reading but on interesting/ enterttaining material. Alot of essays. Allows at least 7 absences. If he sees you are at a higher level than the class you are taking he helps you get bumped up.
6774,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL68,5.0,4.0,He was the best professor  that i have
6775,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had.  Dynamic, entertaining, caring, encouraging, tough but fair.  Used to stand on desks and take us outside to have class under the ""Enke Tree"".  Great tricks for getting us interested and involved.  More importantly though, I learned something and I enjoyed doing it.  The guy's aces!"
6776,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG67,5.0,3.0,Enke is the Best professor . He is hilarious and very caring. He treats you like an adult and expects you to do your work. He is kind of a tough grader but he is willing to help you in and outside of class.
6777,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG67,5.0,2.0,one of the best teachers you can have
6778,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,1A,5.0,5.0,"Enke is first class.  I took his class based on feedback. He helped me hone my english/lit skills. I was a always the math/tech guy. After this class, I was able to  xfer to the Claremont Colleges. I am now a successful attorney and had no problems writing once xferred. He made english/lit interesting. Be ready to work!"
6779,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,3.0,Didn't learn how to make my essays better at all his feedback on essays was lousy. He only lets you miss up to 7 times which can add up quickly. The novels read in class are just boring as well as the films. Take another professor this one is a waste of time.
6780,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"I love Enke ! Lectures were never boring, he talks very loud and clear &amp; walks around a lot which is cool to keep us attentive. He is incredibly smart &amp; really wants his students to learn. I seriously wish all professors were like him. You'll def. read, &amp; there will be short easy  quizzes. He can be sarcastic &amp; crack jokes. He's the best! TAKE HIM!"
6781,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,1A,4.0,4.0,First time when I took this class I thought I was going to fail but at the end I did ok. If you like reading you were enjoy his class. If not then prepare to work hard
6782,1478873,Gary,Enke,Mt. San Antonio College,English,LIT4647,5.0,2.0,"There's homework every night in his Literature 46 and 47 classes but never any exams or essays.  He is an amazing professor.  Extremely interesting, super blunt, and super funny."
6784,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANA35,1.0,4.0,If you know anatomy well you will be fine if you don't you are screwed. Gives questions that were never taught or shown in modules. Does not care about what some students are going through as some students may be in a financial crisis trying to provide for their family. Thinks time it takes for online exams is same as in person. Do not take her.
6785,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10B,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pascoe is very supportive, genuine, and caring. I took this class during summer break (online because of COVID) and it was a lot of work, so definitely dont procrastinate. Her lectures are very organized and makes physiology easy to understand. I went to all of her office hours via Zoom and she was more than willing to help."
6786,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT10B,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pascoe is one of the best Professor at Mt. SAC. Took her for summer and there were three lecture units exams, pre final, and final exam (cumulative). There are 13 quizzes which are easy. She recorded all lecture videos, very detailed and must take notes. She makes every feedbacks on every works turned in. Overall, shes exceptional."
6787,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35,5.0,5.0,"Anat35, not an easy class. Expect it to be and you wont pass. That being said, she is very organized and straightforward. Provides everything you need to get a good grade. Will answer every and any question you have, gives tons of extra credit but its up to you to take advantage of it (Study!). Very sweet lady. I would definitely take her again."
6788,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35AND36,5.0,4.0,"Took her for Anatomy &amp; saw her passion in teaching, so I signed up for physio with her. Must put in time &amp; work. ALWAYS available for clarifications. A difficult class in general, but with her teaching the subject, I feel prepared for future classes. Do not take her for an easy A. She wants her students to be successful in their fields."
6789,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35,4.0,5.0,"This professor is so kind and caring- its not her fault this material can be very, very difficult. She provides you with everything you need and its obvious she is invested in your success. Sometimes there are quizzes every day of class, but she gives lots of review time &amp; youre free to review in your own way. Always available for questions!"
6790,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANA35,2.0,5.0,"Save yourself. Find another professor. This was my first D in my life. Tough grader. Weekly Quizzes. Spelling counts, even in homework packets. Packets are tough to do because she has you label parts we aren't even doing and still grades you for it. She does not explain muscles well at all. No one in the class knew muscle facts. Trust, don't do it."
6791,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT3536,5.0,4.0,Anatomy and Physiology are tough classes but professor Pascoe made it very manageable. She explains the lecture material very well and she is very clear on what you need to study for exam. She is always available when you need extra help.
6792,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35,3.0,5.0,"Anatomy is a tough class but she will help you understand the material. Having said that, there is something that other people forgot to mention: she has favorites. If you get on her good side, all is well. But if you dont, shell bring up stuff you did in the beginning of the semester and use it against you. Just a warning, and good luck!"
6793,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO35,5.0,4.0,"Took the 6 week course with professor Pascoe. She was caring of her students and worked hard to make sure we understood the subject. Anatomy is difficult but long as you try, you can definitely pass. To whoever said she shouldn't teach at a Junior College because she's way too advanced, you probably were just goofing off and not trying hard enough."
6794,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35,5.0,3.0,Professor Pascoe was honestly a very lovely professor who was there to help whenever needed. I took this class during the summer and obviously we had to put in our fair share of studying and effort. The user below is mostly likely from my class and shouldnt be trusted. They put in very little effort and failed from the beginning.
6795,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANA35,2.0,5.0,"I took her during summer and yes I understand summer is 16 weeks broken down to 6 weeks but she shouldn't teach at a Junior College she's way too advanced. Her nickname is Satan and she lives up to it, I'll give you a perfect example if you take a test or a quiz make sure you know how to spell because if not she marks you off and it affects grade"
6796,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35AND36,5.0,3.0,Professor Pascoe was a great professor. Better than some I took at a UC. Her exams are straight forward. Either you were paying attention to her in class or not. Your grade will reflect it. I recommend recording her lectures so you don't miss anything. Shes funny and nice and helps you out as much as she can. Great professor!
6797,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANA35,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. She tell you what are good test questions. Anatomy was a tough class but professor Pascoe made it fun and interesting. I struggled in the beginning (learning her style/ways) but ended up with a ""B"". I recommend her!"
6798,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35,5.0,5.0,"At the beginning of this class, I didnt really like her very much because I thought she was harsh and difficult, but once I re-evaluated myself and the class itself (ANATOMY is no walk in the park), I did great in class with her help - office hours, making study guide, and she gave many extra credit in every test and quizzes. Love her now ��"
6799,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANA35,4.0,5.0,"Professor Pascoe is a good teacher. She is very difficult, however anatomy is a difficult subject. She is willing to answer questions if you show her that you are paying attention. I think she was actually one of the best anatomy teachers. I dont think she is trying to make the class very difficult, it is just that anatomy requires a lot out of you"
6800,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35,3.0,5.0,"Shes really helpful during lab and offers extra credit opportunities. However, you HAVE to be a hard working student in order to pass her class. Quizzes every day and make sure you know spelling. Rushes through lecture but if you use lecture notes, they can be helpful for the exams."
6801,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT36,1.0,5.0,"Very straightforward, comes off as harsh/subtly rude. sometimes makes u feel awkward for even asking a question, by her response. She's good @ teaching lab, but lectures are very vague, and quick. Doesn't Follow book well, and changes a lot of words from the text book. Do the lecture notes, it's your study guide for the exam.  13 stud's dropped"
6802,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT36,2.0,4.0,"Goes over materiel TOO fast. Jumps all over the book chapters, not consistent. Better at teaching lab, not so good at lecture. Get's irritated when ask to repeat, or further explain a topic. Exams are tricky. A quiz every week for lect &amp; lab Kind of sarcastic when answering questions, sometimes makes you feel dumb. Do lect notes package to study"
6803,1483066,Virginia,Pascoe,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,ANAT35,2.0,4.0,"Very vague when lecturing, goes over tough materials too fast, TOUGH GRADER."
6805,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEOG1,1.0,5.0,Professor Lobb is not a very helpful teacher. She grades like shes teaching kids how to become professional meteorologists. Her essays are ridiculous. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TAKING THIS CLASS!!!!
6806,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEOG30,1.0,5.0,"The teacher is awful. She has a lot of sources but does not match quizzes and exams. Heavy works. Two discussions each week. An hour video (total 3 videos) and have to answer questions. Her discussion holds a heavy part in your grade as like the quiz. If you want A, DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!!ï¿½ï¿½REALLY!"
6807,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEOG30,1.0,5.0,"If you're looking for easy A, NEVER take her. Quizzes mostly don't match her lecture and study guide. 2 attempts allowed but only last one score and can't go back to the questions once you click next. Discussions/essays require tons of reading and watching hours long video. Even follow the prompt exactly, not giving full credits. PICK SOMEONE ELSE"
6808,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEOG2,5.0,4.0,"Great class for those who are dedicated to work for their grade. Though the 3rd version of the textbook is recommended for the class, I got away entirely fine with using the less expensive 2nd version (though chapters 9 &amp; 11 are swapped). No zoom calls. Discussion/essay + quiz due twice a week, Sunday and Thursday. Put in the effort and you're good"
6809,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,2.0,4.0,literally all her resources were outdated from like 2004 and she just wants you to write on whats interesting for her which can be common in some professors but she was really picky it was always pass or fail essay even when I worked very hard and followed the prompt.. just find someone else (:
6810,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,5.0,2.0,Initially I felt intimidated to take human geography but Elizabeth is very clear on what she wants from her students. This ended up being one of my favorite classes because I feel I learned so many useful things that i can incorporate into my life. Just stay on top of assignments you should be fine. She also responds to messages right away.
6811,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,5.0,4.0,If you are looking for an easy A to breeze over do not take Professor Lobb. If you want to genuinely explore Geography and have a great experience take Professor Lobb! I enjoyed her class because of her ability to keep the information given engaging. Cannot express how great of a Professor she is.
6812,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO1,1.0,5.0,Exams do not match study guide and lecture. Is not approachable for questions and very degrading.
6813,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,1.0,5.0,"Dont take her, just dont do it trust me anyone else is better"
6814,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO1,1.0,5.0,Visualizing Physical Geography 2nd ed textbook required. Lots of reading. Discussion forums. Vid lectures. Transcript provided. Study questions straight from textbook but not really helpful at all. Ch quizzes 20 questions timed. Allowed attempts 2. Beware only LAST score counts and questions change. 1 midterm and final 100 questions plus essays.
6815,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO5,5.0,3.0,"Great!! Three exams with essays + e.c, three map quizzes &amp; chapter quizzes, she has mini group projects to introduce the region. 2 mandatory research papers, 3 opportunities tho. she gives you the link to the textbook, I would take her again if I could. The study guides are accurate to the test. Just study from the lectures and know your maps!"
6816,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,4.0,4.0,She is witty and her sarcasm is a must. She makes learning about this subject very fun.
6817,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO1,5.0,4.0,"Prof Lobb is very good! I took her online GEO summer course and at first I was afraid of the technical side of this subject. However, professor Lobb made the reading material very interesting and her lecture videos are online so you can just keep reviewing them if you don't understand something. She also gives you the notes for the chapter's!"
6818,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEOG2,5.0,4.0,"Lobb is a great professor! Took her online GEOG2 class (8 weeks), she provides great and helpful lectures, clear instructions on assignments, VERY organized, lots of reading as well but overall I highly recommend this course."
6819,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,5.0,4.0,Needed lots of work on analysis. There are quizzes and discussions or analysis paper due every week. The discussion and analysis papers need a very good understanding of the topic. Sometimes the assignments are hard to understand but you can ask the prof. She is caring and replies fairly fast.
6820,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,5.0,3.0,"This was online and you don't need the book just use the lectures she gives you. It's a good class, there are videos to watch and only a few essays on the midterm and final, but other than that you don't have to do that much writing. She's really nice, too."
6821,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO5,5.0,3.0,I had to do some make up work and she was amazing always cared a lot and she let me do the exam on another day. I really recommend her she even referred me to the Honors program. She's awesome.
6822,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2,5.0,1.0,Professor Lobb has an adorable and sweet personality and she can make Human Geography a fascinating subject. Tests are multiple choice with 2 short essays and exams are 2 short essays with a long one as well. As long as you pay attention to her lectures and write down everything she says you will pass. You don't the textbook just pay attention!
6823,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO1,2.0,4.0,I do not recommend this Professor. Her grading is absolutely ridiculous. If she asks a homework questions and you adequately answer it she will reply with the exact example she wanted you to use. Absolutely ridiculous and unfair Professor. Do not take her unless you want to break your brain on what answers would please her enough for an A.
6824,1492345,Elizabeth,Lobb,Mt. San Antonio College,Geography,GEO2H,4.0,3.0,"We learned about rain down in Africa and we took some time to learn the things we never had. There was no line, she was always on time"
6826,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GEOL10,5.0,2.0,"Professor Webb is passionate about Geology, especially Natural Disasters. The way he teaches made it very interesting and easy to learn. It was never a dull moment during lectures. I took him for Spring when we transitioned to online courses and even then his online lectures were great. He also lets you earn a good amount of extra credit every exam"
6827,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,5.0,3.0,"Even if I did not get the A, he still encourages you to strive to work hard in the class. Corona took away the class meetings and it was not the same but he still made videos and took time out of his day to help us succeed."
6828,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3METO3L,5.0,2.0,"He is the best prof so far! He is good at teaching and entertaining. If I can give the best prof award, I would give it to him. His lectures are important. His exams are based on his lectures 99.9%. I just memorized all the lectures, and I got A+. His personality is so nice, makes me wanna go to class. Homeworks are easy. 10/10."
6829,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,5.0,3.0,"Yo, Craig is literally THE best professor i've ever had a class with. He's the type of guy that you'd want as a friend. He tells so many dad jokes and makes the class super interesting. He's super helpful and loves to talk with his students. I took him for natural disasters for credit and wanted to take him for METO 3 and loved it."
6830,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,5.0,3.0,Professor Webb is AMAZING! He is a ball of energy and extremely enthusiastic. This makes the subject a lot easier to understand. The class isn't easy but he makes it clear on what he is going to have on the test. He passes out lecture notes that you fill in as he's lecturing. It helps so much! Would 100% recommend taking.
6831,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3METO3L,5.0,4.0,"The subject matter alone should satisfy your curiosity. Clear and concise lectures; injects energy in to the class; lets you know what's expected, but no surprises."
6832,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,4.0,1.0,Took him in the winter and he was full of energy at 7:30 am. The notes and quizzes he posts online are pretty much your study guide for the exams. Very straight up.
6833,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,5.0,3.0,"Wonderful teacher and always in a good spirt, get ready to hear a lot of dad jokes. Textbook mandatory use, wont pass without it but gives good notes to help"
6834,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,5.0,3.0,"If you study the notes he gives, you will pass the exams. what you need to do to get an A is read the textbook. If you read the textbook every chapter, the texts will be easy. So consider the notes as an outline for reviewing exams and read the textbook. Has extra credits on ever exam, so I end up getting over 100% final grade."
6835,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GEO10,5.0,3.0,"Craig is the definition of a corny dad. He has the best sense of humor and is full of energy-even at 8 am. He made the course very interesting. He gives guided notes, just fill in with powerpoint, which aren't posted online. Test are the same material as notes. Field trip is required. No homework. Drops lowest test grade. Don't need the book."
6836,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GELO10,4.0,3.0,If coffee was a person it would be Craig. He is the best professor I ever had. His lectures are interesting and won't put you to sleep. Just really study the notes and you will pass his tests and you do not need a book. A field trip is required or you won't pass the class. No homework. TAKE HIM!
6837,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,4.0,3.0,"I was scared of this class but he made it easy to like. He is a high energy comedian. The class was great. Just finished taking him for winter and it was fun. Only 4 exams and the final, no homework, and he helps you prepare your notes for the exams. He loves answering questions and loves what he teaches. Take him you won't regret it."
6838,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3,5.0,3.0,"What an energetic engaging professor. He has handouts for notes and these notes are exactly whats on his test. Anyone who finds him difficult is not putting in effort. He overall was a really positive experience and someone who enjoys teaching. Air Rises, Cools, Condenses and forms Clouds. Amazing and wish him the best."
6839,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GEO10,5.0,4.0,"I took Professor Webb for Winter (Natural Disasters) and the class was way too fast! I highly recommend taking him for winter/summer. There is a field trip so be prepare for that. He also has a good sense of humor, he is energetic! Fun class, a little challenging. Half way done with the class I had a low C. Ended up passing with a high B."
6840,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GEO8,5.0,3.0,Professor Webb made earth science interesting. He reminds me of Bill Nye but with corky humor. He certainly knows his stuff so I'd suggest you pick his brain. He was very entertaining and inspired me to learn more about earth science. You won't regret taking his class. He's very thorough and attentive to his students! Awesome teacher!
6841,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,METO3METO3L,4.0,3.0,"I am taking him for the METO lab this spring semester, have only had one class with him, and am already excited! He is hilarious and makes the lectures and labs interactive and fun!!"

6843,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GELO10,4.0,4.0,"His lectures are hilarious and he makes them fun. As long as you take notes, go on the field trip, and study for the exams you'll be fine."
6844,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GEOL10,5.0,1.0,"I took professor Webb for winter 2016 and I have to say he was the best teacher I have ever had. He's very funny and passionate about Geol 10.I recommend paying attention , and studying for tests.I would definitely take him again!!!"
6845,1474445,Craig,Webb,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,GEOL10,5.0,3.0,"Prof Webb saved my education. He instills confidence to tackle any sci class like no other prof, and he will for you too. Relentlessly passionate. He never gets bored or uninterested in the material, or your questions. Tests are hard, but he prepares you so well for them it won't feel that way. You'll learn lots and feel like it meant something."
6846,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH68,4.0,4.0,If you are looking for an easy way out cross him out of your daycare list. He is a really great professor who makes you think and put what you know into work. Many may say he is the worst because he is straight forward with you but its only because he knows you could do better. His class helped me unveil my writhing strengths.
6847,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH68,1.0,5.0,Do not take this teacher. You'll find yourself spending more time trying to find the will power to stay awake in this class than actually paying attention. He is extraordinarily mean. Does not count homework. Homework doesn't even help. He uses pretentious language that the average 68 student will never understand. I very much despise this teacher.
6848,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,5.0,I would not recommend this professor. Lectures are boring and long. The homework he gives are a waste of time because he does not count them as a grade. And if you are looking forward to getting an A in this class I recommend not taking it because he is a tough grader on essays.. most of the grades he gave were Cs...
6849,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,2.5,4.0,Hes super boring. Very soft spoken and hard to understand. Uses two books for homework and is not lenient with grades. Don't take unless you're good at writing. Majority of students in this class got a C.
6850,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH68,4.0,5.0,"He is a real college professor, so if you are looking for a daycare provider who will coo at you and tell you everything you do is wonderful, you are in the building. There is no way around him other than doing the work. A good grade is possible if you do the work as expected."
6851,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH68,3.0,4.0,took him during winter session hard but I enjoyed it you have to pay attention and do the work in class.
6852,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH68,5.0,4.0,"By no means is an easy teacher but if come willing to work and learn you'll be okay. Great professor for the serious, motivated student. Slackers, don't get out of bed."
6853,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL68,2.0,3.0,"I honestly do not know whether or not I would recommend him. On one had I found his course really interesting, on the other it was pretty difficult to understand what he wanted. I earned an ""A"" in the course over summer so it is possible to do well. If you struggle at all with English then I would avoid his class but if you just need a refresher go"
6854,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,2.0,5.0,"Very difficult and demanding. Does not discuss assignments much, and would rather discuss the abstract. He grades very hard and I wish he would explain what is expected or helped us improve our writing. Very strict, follow prompt rules EXACTLY. Class can be very boring since the dominating topic of the lectures is philosophy."
6855,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL68,4.5,4.0,"Hard, but I'm learning alot."
6856,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,3.0,5.0,I found his class really challenging. I'm used to getting A's on all my english papers...and he NEVER gave one student an A on a paper the whole sememster. His class is also really boring. If youre a lazy student and are not willing to try...dont take his class
6857,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,4.5,4.0,I don't know if hes the best teacher at mtsac or the worst cause I haven't had them all but I thought he was very informative and fair.
6858,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,2.0,5.0,Worst teacher in the english department and in all the campus...
6859,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,4.0,4.0,"he's one of the hardest english teachers that i've come across. i took him for ENGLISH 1A in summer 2010, &amp; i got a B. if you don't want to work hard for a good grade, i suggest you don't take his class. his class is only for those who want a challenge."
6860,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.5,4.0,"This professor loves what he does, and it shows.  He has little patience for cell phones and will not allow you to leave the room to take phone calls.  He is a hard grader, but only because he challenges you to think critically.  If he taught any other classes, I would take those too."
6861,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,4.5,3.0,"Totally awesome professor, made Shakespeare relevant to me, and I'm not that into lit. Not all students appreciate his talents."
6862,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL68,4.5,4.0,"He taught me how to write at the college level, something my high school had not prepared me for."
6863,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,4.0,Best English professor I've ever had!
6864,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,4.0,"This professor is the best, because the most demanding, English professor I've ever had. The few overparted, lazy, or tempermentally disgruntled types who infested my section seem to be the only ones who've posted comments here so far. Take Nemeth for 68 or 1A-you'll never forget him!"
6865,1495041,Stanley,Nemeth,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,1.0,5.0,"Half of the students get dropped out. He gives out In-class writing Essay, which you must type them during the weekend. You must never include any new ideas. He is a harsh grader. If you want to get a grade that you put your effort in, do not take his class. It is so boring. He is old, so you get this incomprehensible tone."
6867,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,3.0,"I took her HYBRID class. I have a strong math background but it was kind of hard to keep up because my other class would conflict. Her lectures are great!!! If you go to her office hours asking for help then you'll do good in the class trust me. ALEKS is used, if you don't finish by the due date, after the final she will open them again for a week"
6868,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,2.0,5.0,"If math is easy for you then you should take this professor. If math isnt your strong point then I suggest not taking her as she can be discouraging to those who struggle. Before taking this class be aware she uses a math program called Aleks, pls look into it before enrolling. Aleks is what ruined this class for me and others in the class."
6869,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,4.0,2.0,"The homework is online and graded online. Attendance is not mandatory, but his used for your grade. She does give other options if her lessons are not as clear (but they are.) This professor is laid back and enjoys to talk before the lessons and enjoys to know about her students. The homework at times is heavy depending on the chapter."
6870,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,4.0,"My class was a hybrid mostly online but I did had class time with this awesome professor. She's super funny and knows her stuff, she's a fair grader and she wants you to succeed but you have to show her that you know the material. I had 15 units and this was my hardest class, there's a lot of concepts to learn so use YouTube and her office hours!"
6871,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,3.0,"I took math 71+7, I highly recommend this class. I've always been good at math but hadn't taken one since 2008. B/c of her class, I have my confidence back! The Aleks hw can be challenging but if you complete it you will do really well. The tests are much easier than the hw. Just dont fall behind on Aleks. Spend at least 2 hrs a day on it!"
6872,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,2.0,Hybrid class. Super great! Really cares about her students and making sure they all succeed. Makes sure everybody knows they can reach out anytime and gives her availability. Oline work on Aleks can be tedious but not very hard. Very easy class if you do your study guides and keep up with Aleks. Definitely recommend taking her class!
6873,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,2.0,"I really enjoyed her hybrid class. She is a hilarious person. If you need to take any math class for credit, take her hybrid class. But if you are struggling with a math, do not take hybrid class."
6874,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,3.0,"my experience with her was amazing. She is such an easy going professor and easy to talk to. If you took high school algebra 2 or trigonometry it will be a breeze for you. if you struggle with math and aren't willing to work at it, shes not an easy A. you need o buy alex code, but no book so not bad. daily online aleks quizes. Shes amazing!!!!"
6875,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,3.0,3.0,"If you have a hard time with math than the online class isn't for you. She doesn't teach/lecture AT ALL. On the days that you meet, you only do exams . The program ALEKS is the one teaching you how to solve for problems and 99.9% of the time, I would have to youtube it because ALEKS explanation didn't make sense. If ur good at math then take her."
6876,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,1.0,5.0,"Dropped the class since it was a hybrid course. ALEKS was being used as homework, (which also costs around $80). ALEKS is annoying, since you cannot move on to another problem until you get it right, which takes forever &amp; makes life miserable. She does not teach during the day you meet, you teach yourself basically. Don't take the class, seriously."
6877,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,4.0,I took her hybrid class and she was so great. She breaks it all down and gives you a million opportunities to bring your grade up and get your bad scores on homework up to good scores. She is very nice and cracks a lot of jokes. She is very easy going and will help as much as she possibly can. She even gives days IN CLASS to do the homework
6878,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,3.0,"Since Chavez is a Great professor in Mt. Sac, student should take her. I took her in math 50 through math 130. Students who got off from high school I recommend taking her. Im going to miss her."
6879,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH50-71,5.0,4.0,She really is such a good teacher takes the time to make sure you really understand everything. I hate math partly cus Im not good at it but this was my fav class to go to cus she always managed to make us laugh wish I could take her again!
6880,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,1.0,"favorite professor since ive been at mtsac for 2 years. cares SO much about everyone passing, will change her schedule to be accessible out of class, gives LOTS of extra credit opportunities and is super funny during her lectures always smiling &amp; willing to help. Easy material! Took her friday class and wish i could take her again ill miss her! :("
6881,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH071,5.0,3.0,"I took Chavez for math 50-71 and I have to say it was the best experience I've had as a college student. She really cares about her students and goes over the material enough for everyone to comprehend. She takes the time to get to know her students, making the class enjoyable and seem shorter than what it really is. I highly recommend taking her."
6882,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH071,5.0,2.0,"1/18/2017 Im currently taking her class for Math 71 overall she is a good teacher knows how to talk to students, and knows what to talk about during her lectures. If you know math already or dont know a single thing about math then i recommend taking her class. I took math 50 thru math 51 with Chavez, and learned new short cuts/ methods."
6883,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH50,5.0,1.0,Took her for a condensed hybrid class this fall. Math is the subject I like the least and this turned out to be my favorite class this semester. I wish she taught every level of math class offered.
6884,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH50,5.0,3.0,"I have always hated math, but because of her I found out math its actually FUN!  she always has an answer for everything. her classes are full of energy, always has something funny to say, love her stories!"
6885,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,4.0,4.0,"I loved her as a math teacher. She really knows her stuff, once you get past her sarcasm( which can be tough), she really is a great math professor.  You have to work for your grade. While HW isn't graded, its best to do it for the practice. If you don't practice or study or only very minimally, don't expect to pass this class."
6886,1507391,Dolores,Chavez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,3.0,4.0,"Hilarious and clever teacher, very likeable, but the class was hard and she won't take any excuses or hold your hand along the way. She gives A LOT of homework, and tests frequently If you're talking or get something wrong she's probably going to put you on blast"
6888,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,2.0,"Professor Troxell is probably one of the best Math professors Ive had throughout college. I wish I had him in person but he is very organized and straightforward with being online. Hes very caring for his students and patient if you need help. He wants his students to do well, which means you have to put your part in. 10/10 recommend! Hes Great!"
6889,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110S,4.0,3.0,"I took Professor Troxell back in the Fall of 2019 for Math 110S. If you're like me, and happen to be pretty bad at math, then Troxell is a solid choice for you. He genuinely wants his students to do well and have fun, even though he's a bit monotone, he's still a pretty quirky guy to keep your attention on him in my opinion. Highly recommended!"
6890,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,2.0,"I am terrible at math but Professor Troxell made the subject easy to understand. I didn't think that I'd be able to learn that well online but it's been pretty easy. He's nice and truly wants you to succeed. Trust me, take him !"
6891,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,4.0,4.0,"Professor Troxell is an adequate professor. I'm horrible at Math, and I performed excellent, even with the transition to online classes in Spring 2020. If you can't quite grasp the material right when he first teaches it, let him know and he'll break it down. His tests are very similar to his worksheets. Submit decent work, and you'll be alright."
6892,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,4.0,2.0,"Professor is really cool. What you see on the review sheets is what you'll expect in the exams. Allows us to use formula sheets because there's too many to memorize. Overall, he's a great professor."
6893,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,110S,5.0,3.0,"AMAZING! I'm horrible at math, but he makes it super easy to understand! A lot of homework, but he let us use notes on quizzes which helped. He isn't condescending or mean and he has accessible office hours. Cons: your grade is kind of unknown up until it's posted on your transcript bc he doesn't update Canvas . Other than that, TAKE HIM!!!"
6894,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110S,5.0,4.0,"you won't regret taking him if you're bad at math like me. he's the best. the test is the exact same format as the study guides, he lets you use notes on quizzes, and goes out of his way to make sure every student has a calculator everyday. his tests are hard, but he drops a low test, quiz, and hw score if u show up to class everyday and try"
6895,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,3.0,"If you have the chance to take him for Math 110, please do! Mr. Troxell is patient with his students in his class. Do the worksheets that he will provide you! They will help you prepare for the exam and he will tell you what WILL be on the test! Practice the worksheets as much as you need! Very caring, and he will help you succeed for the better!"
6896,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,4.0,"He is the best math professor I have ever had. I have taken him twice. Once for math 51 and math 110. He makes you work for your grade, but it's expected. You have to study or you will fail. I have spoken to him about getting my bachelor's. He's very motivational. He has a masters in psychology, and mathematics which I find awesome."
6897,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,4.0,2.0,I took him for fall semester and at first i thought this class was going to be hard but as time goes it gets easy. His worksheets are what's on the test so it comes in handy %100. You MUST pay attention and do your worksheets and review to get a good grade on the test. He collects the worksheets on the day of the test and the day before he reviews!
6898,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH160,2.0,3.0,"DO THE HOMEWORK His lectures kinda monotone but he knows what hes talking about Lots of quizzes A couple times I turned in quizzes with blank spots and hed imply that he doesnt get why I dont get it cause its easy for him. Every once in a while hell geek out in the middle of lecture and talk about something unrelated, yet funny. Hes understanding"
6899,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,1.0,"Professor Troxell is quiet. However, he gives endless amounts of extra credit and the homework on Aleks is a lot but also helpful. Students complained about the $80 code we had to buy but that is actually cheap for a college material! He can be confusing with how things are explained but do your hw and worksheets, &amp; I promise youll pass! Recomend!"
6900,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,2.0,5.0,"IF YOURE NOT GOOD AT MATH dont take this professor, he gets confusing at times and makes you buy an 80 dollar code, but if you can teach yourself and actually STUDY then you can pass. his test are like the study guides and so is the final. just have the ganas to study urself and not depend on him."
6901,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,4.0,3.0,All homework is from ALEKS but he will do sample problems in class. I'm awful at math but really came to a new understanding of algebra after taking his class.
6902,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,3.0,5.0,"If you are an independent student who can teach yourself and do not require a lot of guidance, maybe you like online classes, then this is the professor for you, if you dont mind a lot of tutoring and homework. If you are a student who seeks in depth explanations or just a little more help this is not the class for you. Regardless to much homework"
6903,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,5.0,3.0,"First - I am terrible at math. Second - I had him for 70S and 110S and I got A's in both classes. I've had people in my 110S class say how they wish they had him for 70S.  Yes, he is quiet and MAY come off the wrong way. HOWEVER, just like any human being, he wants to be respected. So: 1) come to class 2) do your work. PERIOD."
6904,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,4.0,4.0,"Took him for math 51 and 71 and passed both of them, and I'm horrible at math. He uses an online program which is extremely helpful, and he also has the patience to help you out when you don't understand the subject."
6905,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,4.0,2.0,"Awesome professor, though his lectures are poor, his worksheets that he hands out are exactly on the exams/final that he gives you! Even in order as well! which helped a lot. Homework was online which was a program that you had to buy but it was pretty easy to do. There are a couple of computer assignments but not to hard."
6906,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,2.0,4.0,"Professor Troxell uses a online program for the entire semester. NO BOOK. The way he grades makes it hard to get a 100 on tests, he goes through all your work and checks for mistakes then counts them against you. He does not explain things clearly and often skips entire steps that are key for you to understand the subject."
6907,1532958,Cameron,Troxell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,3.0,"I took math 51 in winter. Frankly, I was expecting it to be a rough semester considering math isn't my strongest subject. However, Professor Trollex did a decent job teaching us. If you don't understand something, he's more  than willing to help out. Don't be shy to ask questions! Extra credit is based on attendance. Also, no book was needed."
6908,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH155,1.0,5.0,"He is really terrible. In his class we did almost 40 assignments. Do you believe 40 assignments?!!!!!!!! He didnt study us and we had to learn from online software. When we asked him why you give us lot of assignments, he told us you can drop two other courses for having time to do my assignments."
6909,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,1.0,5.0,dont take
6910,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,5.0,"plain and simple, worse teacher at mt sac. I talked to the department chair to file a complaint. Either way though, there's not much that can be done. Once you're hired as a professor, it is very hard to get fired. So, he will be teaching at mt sac for a long time so just make sure to avoid him!!"
6911,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,3.0,3.0,if you pay full attention and do all the homework then this class isnt very difficult but it is easy to fall behind if you miss any class or dont do hw. he moves very fast but he is a brilliant man
6912,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,1.0,4.0,"Goodness.... The extra credit is fine, but this professor expects you to know what he's teaching and when people ask questions, he makes them regret they ever asked. Strongly suggest other professor."
6913,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,1.0,5.0,He is the worst teacher in the school. Dont take him at all cost. I took him two years ago and want to warm everyone that he is horrible. I dropped his class with only 6 people left in his class! I re-took the placement test and got into calculus when I was only taking his math71. He doesn't want to help anyone and gets in arguments easily.
6914,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH160,1.0,5.0,I waited 2 years before reviewing him so that I could have other teachers to compare him to. I started at Math 51 and now I am in Math 285. professor martin is by far the worst math teacher at Mt Sac. He really should not be teaching. His teaching skills are not up to par with the rest of the math department staff. Avoid this teacher at all costs!!
6915,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,3.0,5.0,"For me personally,he was no help at all.He gets fustrated easily and seems to wish he was somewhere else. I really think he hates his job and he has no patience for people who are not fast learners. Sooo....my suggestion if you need someone to be patient, kind,and concerend about your success in math take a diffrent teacher."
6916,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,1.5,5.0,"What kind of professor expects students to know the material that he is about to teach? It seemed like the only people in the class that were going to pass, were the people who had taken the course previously in High School or are retaking the course. Martin was awful!"
6917,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,1.0,4.0,Avoid at all costs
6918,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,1.5,4.0,Worst professor I have ever had. He makes you feel dumb so no one likes to ask questions. Does not teach material well enough so that everyone understands it. Hes rude and unreasonable. Hes horrible. You can pass the class however but you have to deal with him which makes going to class dreadful. Avoid taking him if possible.
6919,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,2.0,5.0,"HE ALWAYS SAYS OUT LOUAD TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT WILL NEVER FULLY ANSWER THEM HE SAYS ""HE CAN'T HELP PEOPLE WHO CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES"". YOU TEACH YOURSELF AND HIS IS RUDE!"
6920,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,5.0,1.0,"He's the best math professor ever! Do your homework diligently and you'll do just fine. He's also a really nice guy, he gives lots of extra credit assignments to boost your grade up."
6921,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,5.0,1.0,"He's awesome!! Easy class, and no final for A students. Hw is extra credit. Quiz and exam are almost same."
6922,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,3.5,1.0,he honestly isnt that bad! I mean if you consider math your strong suit then take him. Practically all his quizzes and test are made up from the book (mostly the example problems)! just dont be lazy and review before the test! also extra credit from hw goes to your quiz grade. He gives you a practice final which is basically the final itself!
6923,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,3.0,2.0,"If you are good at math, then you should take him. Homework is extra credit that goes towards your quiz grades which is 20 percent of your grade. you just have to do your part and do well on the test. get an A in the  class before the final and dont even need to take the final. gives your practice final. take him! youll get an A with hard work!"
6924,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,1.0,5.0,"world's worst teacher, only attend this class if instead on teaching yourself"
6925,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,1.5,1.0,"it's funny to see him teaching himself in 181 throughout the whole semester.. but he uses very common problems that can be found in the textbook for his quizzes and exams, so if u can study by yourself, it'll turn into an easy class"
6926,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,5.0,"Do not take him. Quizzes and tests are extremely hard, hw is extra credit, even though its just 16/1000 overall... He doesn't know how to teach and explain, even if u're trying as hard as possible to do well in class. Extremely impolite, he will not answer your question, but will give u a dirty look instead... All in all, disaster. Do not take him."
6927,1473334,Douglas,Martin,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,1.5,3.0,"His teaching method is pretty horrible. He basically goes over a bunch of examples superfast. However, he gives you extracerdits for doing hw, and if you have an A before the final, you won't have to take the final, he'll just give you an A. Just go to the MARC lab to get help, his class is bearable."
6929,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,1.0,4.0,"The notes videos and worksheets you do in class arent all that helpful when it comes to test and quizzes. Definitely a class you have to work hard in and give your full attention, I dont recommend taking this class if you are working, this class will only bring stress upon you!"
6930,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,1.0,5.0,"SHE IS THE WORST DURING COVID. She will give you videos to watch and take notes, but it will be 2-4 pages a section. Then none of the test questions or homework will be the same level of difficulty. She is not helpful, and does not provide extra credit. Not worth the struggle."
6931,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,1.0,5.0,If you are a student that prefers in-person learning THIS IS NOT THE CLASS OR THE PROFESSOR TO TAKE. trust me. *She does not allow you to use notes on any exams or final and calculator not that much *Her grading system is awful. notes are mandatory but worth nothing and exams and final are worth 100-300points each *formula sheets don't help either
6932,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever. Not even a teacher. How do I get a 100% in all of the Homework and still basically fail the class? Her exams are 30% each so it is a do or die situation. NEVER take her class or you will be screwed. Always got A's in my math classes previously and then she comes into my grades. Avoid her at all costs.
6933,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,1.0,5.0,Okay really?? She gives us 100 questions a night for Homework and they are only 10% of your grade? The other 90% of your grade is three exams that are completely different from the Homework and Study Guide? Impossible. We started off with 32 students in the class and now we have 8 students. That tells you something right there! Embarrassing!
6934,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,1.0,4.0,"I passed this class with an A, but am baffled at how hard she makes a beginner math course. She teaches beginner algebra students like they're in a much more advanced class, and legitimately over-complicates the subject. If you're even slightly bad at math, and have other obligations besides school (i.e. job), do NOT take this professors classes."
6935,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,2.0,5.0,"Very nice lady, well meaning and genuinely cares about her students success. However, she is poorly at executing that care and patience when it comes to teaching the material. She speaks rather fast and has a tendency to mumble. If you dont do the exam reviews you wont pass her tests. Didnt enjoy her class much."
6936,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,2.0,5.0,When she lectures she does the work in the head most of the time without even explaining as if we are supposed to know how to do it.I'm taking her 130+13 support class and even then I see a tutor once a week because they explain everything better. Sometimes I have to teach myself with the examples from the book because she sucks!
6937,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MAT150,1.0,5.0,By far the worst professor I have ever taken. She takes points off the smallest mistakes on tests as well as homework. She explains math to students as if everyone is a genius. Say goodbye to having any sort of free time because you will be studying for these beyond difficult tests. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR SHE WILL MAKE TRIG A NIGHTMARE.
6938,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,1.0,5.0,"Most importantly for test be careful because she grades your scratch work and if you misplace negative sings, thetas or other numerical arguments while showing work she will give you less than half credit. She says TRIG is a STEM class so she grades stupid hard. PLEASE BE WISE AND LEARN FROM ME TAKE SOMEONE ELSE, SHE WILL RUIN YOUR SEMESTER"
6939,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,2.0,5.0,"This prof was too much. I dont know if its because its calculus or because she expects people to pass the class by providing much more difficult questions for tests. Lecture would be really heavy I would not even bother to question I would just teach myself with the book. I dont recommend this prof, she seemed proud in giving people Ds and Fs"
6940,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS, you only get graded o n 3 tests and your final and they are SUPER HARD. I took Math 130 and Math 13 which is to ""help"" you and it ended up making it harder, she teaches too fast and expects you to know everything on the spot WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"
6941,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71X,1.0,5.0,Does not offer extra credit. Does not answer homework questions. Hard test. Definitely I wont recommend her.
6942,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,1.0,4.0,"Worst teacher Ive ever had. She lectures a lot about how we dont understand the homework questions she doesnt teach. Will mark down everything she can on the tests (literally), relies on the homework to make you understand the course, and will drop you if you miss 4 days. Do everything you can to avoid her!"
6943,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,4.0,2.0,"In my opinion Professor Summers class was very easy. She has printed lecture notes, all you need to do is follow along and write solutions. She does not collect homework but definitely do it because her quizzes are from the homework. Offers max extra credit allowed but it's up to you to earn it. Not friendly to students who skip class/leave early."
6944,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,4.0,3.0,She is extremely helpful and always willing to answer questions if you have a problem. Her office hours work perfect because theyre usually right before the class and shes always willing to help you find out what you need to do to make an A. Do the homework because even though she doesnt grade it her quizzes come right off the problems!
6945,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,1.0,1.0,Very rude teacher. I arrived about an hour late on the first day normally I don't miss the first day at all but anyways I go in and she said you've been dropped and then says its 9 o clock and chuckles as a few other students chuckle she really couldn't sound any more sarcastic than that. I totally respect the instructors rules but being humiliated
6946,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71,5.0,4.0,"Taken During Winter 2019. The professor is great at explaining the material while i was taking her class. I would NOT RECOMMEND HER DURING WINTER OR SUMMER IF YOU ARE NOT DEDICATED TO PASSING! HOWEVER! if you're taken the material before, then you might do fine but STUDY HARD. she is great at explaining the material. RECOMMENDED FOR SEMESTER!"
6947,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH110,1.0,4.0,Her teaching is not helpful at all! I would not recommend taking her class especially if you are one to struggle with math.
6948,1480971,Melody,Summers,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH71X,1.0,5.0,"Does not offer sufficient examples for certain lectures. Teaches multiple lessons a day but assigns only one or two or those chapters are homework, then teaches another 5-6 chapters the next class day, but assigns homework based off of the previous lecture day."
6949,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,4.0,4.0,"Students don't be discourage from all this negative comments. The professor cares for its students. This is a college course, not high school. So you are required to do each assignment he assigns. It looks like some of this students below didn't manage their time and blame the professor for a bad grade. Don't google hmw questions, you wont pass."
6950,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1BHYBIRD,3.0,3.0,"Professor Masoomian is prompt with posting homework keys, mid-term and final exam grades.  Many of the questions on mid-term &amp; final are from the homework so be sure to study them before any test. He gives credit points for  attending class which helps big time with your grade, so do not miss class--these are EASY points.  No extra credit."
6951,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1B,2.0,4.0,"Professor Masoomian is very knowledgeable about economics, but he can't teach it.  It is not a hard subject, but he doesn't help make it any easier to learn. His lectures are not difficult, but his tests are hard. If you ask questions he makes you feel like you should already know the answer. Unless you love econ, do not take this professor."
6952,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUS1A,2.5,4.0,"Must read the book to understand the material. Concepts are easy, but takes some time to analyze. I think he cares about his students. If you need help, go to his office hours. Study the homework assignments, and do your best to get full points on them. Not impossible to get an A. Don't be discouraged! I really liked Mr. Masoomian. I got an A."
6953,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,ECON1A,3.0,2.0,"Read the book and make sure the answers for assignment are what the question specifically asks for, then you will get an easy A. The subject itself is pretty easy, it is more on common sense and general knowledge."
6954,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1B,2.0,4.0,"Professor Masoomian is a very knowledgeable guy, but not a good teacher. There are about 6 assignments that are scantron and short answer combined; do well on these because they will save your grade. I learned more from reading the book than I did during his lectures. He is not very helpful if you have questions. Study and read if you want to pass."
6955,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,2.5,4.0,"Tests are difficult, make sure to read the book and teach yourself. The trick is to do your absolute best and not slack off on each quiz so the tests don't sink you."
6956,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSCA1A,2.0,4.0,"I guess I was not just interested in Economics that's why it's a lot harder for me to like this class. Also, he wasnt a big help at all to keep the discussion lively and interesting. No extra credit, no projects. 10 homework, midterm, and final. Lectures are sooo boring and I pretty much learned everything by myself."
6957,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,1.0,4.0,"you wont learn a single thing going to his class, everything i learned, i learned on my own by reading the book. when ever you ask him a question, he goes on a random tangent that is not relative to the question asked. the homework is not hard, but time consuming cause you have to spend time teaching yourself the material. never gives study guides."
6958,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,MICROECON,4.5,4.0,"I dont know what all of these other students are talking about. However I do know that Professor Masoomian is one of the many great professors I have had at Mt.sac. I am currently attending a prestigious university after transferring from Mt.sac and one of my classes is Business Econ, If it were not for Masoomian's knowledge I would be in trouble."
6959,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1AH,1.5,2.0,"Relatively easy professor, but that's mainly because the material's simple (just read the book and you're fine). BUT, the biggest problem with this professor is his personality; he's rude and condescending! I would recommend you avoid him if possible, but if not, just be quiet and study and he won't target you for his rude remarks."
6960,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSA1AMACRO,2.0,3.0,"As a person he is extremely rude and unapproachable. However as a teacher I think he does a decent job of going over the material that's going to be on the test and his handouts and hw reflect how he's going to test so that was a plus.  Overall the class is not too difficult, his personality is the only deterent."
6961,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,1.0,5.0,i dont wear my seat belt driving to school because i want to die before i can make it to this class.
6962,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,1.0,5.0,"He is very rude to students, and he doesn't use the language accurately (considering this was an online class). He doesn't provide any feedback to students about their work. Rarely does he responds to emails. His activities are extremely confusing, and students are criticized when they ask questions. He should not be a college professor."
6963,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,2.5,2.0,Overall BUSC1A is pretty easy. Do the required reading and you'll be fine. I think the students who struggle the most don't study or go over the material because the answers to their questions could have been found in the book. There are opportunities for extra credit! He's very fair with grading and wants students to succeed. Just do the reading!
6964,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSA1A,3.0,4.0,"He is great. Understanding him was hard, but you have to do the reading, give some extra time to it. The info is really interesting anyways, its our life we are learning about as well, so it makes sense to pay attention. If you are deteremined to take the Econ classes take him he will explain if you don't understand and he is good at clarifying."
6965,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1B,2.5,2.0,He is pretty hilarious and is a good teacher. He will make fun of you and make you feel dumb if you ask dumb questions though. If you take the class seriously you can do well and he really knows his stuff.
6966,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUS1AH,4.0,3.0,"I think he is a good professor. Assignments are from the book and he does everything in his power to get people to pass his class. The test are pretty hard though, they are super in depth and not concepts from the book, other than this not hard. For a honors course I do not think its that hard and it is not impossible to get an A or B. I got an A."
6967,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,1.5,5.0,"Definitely a hard class. No study guides, no power points, all vocal lectures, and tests that he took from other teachers, so sometimes there are different terms. The tests require situational thinking. Study hard and read, then maybe you can get a good B. Do not expect an A unless econ clicks with you and is your best friend."
6968,1488780,Rasool,Masoomian,Mt. San Antonio College,Economics,BUSC1A,1.0,5.0,"I'm an honor student at Sac, and I have never came across a teacher that has frustrated me as much as Masoomian. He is the best at Sac, but he's tough to pass with an A or B. Study hard because his exams use terminology that the book doesn't even use. If you're taking 12+ units, don't take him because you'll feel overwhelmed. Need to know the book!"
6970,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,ENGL1A,5.0,2.0,Just come in class and ace the papers. Her tutor also helps a lot!
6971,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,2.0,She is one of my favorite professors. She made the class fun and not boring. Just ace her papers and you will be fine!
6972,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,1.0,5.0,"Be aware! She does not care what you say and when you have questions, she doesn't want to answer it at all. She is very impatient. And, make sure if you take her class, do not ever question anything she said, otherwise you will be screwed. She won't take any suggestions and she only thinks that you want to argue with her."
6973,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA80,5.0,3.0,"There are lots of assignments in this class, if you do not have time to study do not take this class. Overall its a good class and you leaned a lot. Easy A if you study hard and do all the assignments."
6974,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,5.0,"I took this class for spring 2020, first month we took in class and we transfer to online from 3/18. she is really nice and warm hearted professor, there are a lot of homeworks but well designed and neccessary for essays. the class materials are intersting and meaningful, she also did a good job at google slide, really impressive.i learnt a lot!"
6975,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,3.0,"I learned a lot in Professor Mezaki's class. She is really nice and warm-hearted. She did a lot of extra work to keep everybody on track. There may be a lot of homework, but it is welldesigned and neccesary. The class materials are interesting and meaningful. If you keep working hard, you will make amazing progress. I highly recommend her!"
6976,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Mezaki is a super great teacher. Even though there is a lot of homework and classwork in her class, it is not difficult if you pay attention and follow instructions.

6977,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,3.0,"She is an excellent professor, and I am very grateful for her wonderful teaching. She prepares learning materials for her students, so you don't need to spend money on textbooks. She tries her best to teach her students as much as possible, so you will become very strong in reading and writing English. To take her class is your best choice!"
6978,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,3.0,"She really cares about her students. She loves singing in class and makes fun. This class will have a lot of homework, but you will also learn a lot in her class. Her class is a good way to learn and prepare yourself to take English 1 A. I recommend to take her class with this professor . Thank you Barbara."
6979,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA43W,5.0,2.0,"Passionate!! This professor is a tough grader, but thats what made me better and prepared for higher divisions courses. She is caring for those who cares."
6980,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,3.0,4.0,"Rumor has it she's horrible and doesn't respect her students. However, It's not like that actually. She's tough and strict, but the content of class is very helpful for teenagers I think. Too much homework, and you may be kicked out in the next class to finish it if you didn't do. You may not get a high grade, but if you follow her you can pass."
6981,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA42,5.0,3.0,"Barbara is a great professor! Some student said that she is strict ,but as a smart person you could know why the teacher want to be strict. The reason just only be professional ,be good, be responsible!"
6982,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mezaki shows respect towards her students and make her lectures very interesting. She is very understanding and makes English a lot less daunting. If I could give a score higher than 5, I would. One of the best professors on campus. Truly an inspiration for me to pursue a higher understanding of the language. Thank you professor!"
6983,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,4.0,"Quizzes were frequent, but worth the while."
6984,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,3.0,Amazing teacher! My writing improved massively through my enrollment in her course. Her quips and humor also season the lectures to prevent a student from getting bored.
6985,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,1.0,5.0,"I took this professor last semester. She never care what you say. I took her class almost 2 months and never absent but one day I was very sick and I emailed her but she didnt reply me. Plus when I ask questions, she seems like doesnt want to answer me at all. Study fast and I got nothing."
6986,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,3.0,"She is a great professor. If you are willing to learn something, take her class. If you just want to an easy class, don't take it."

6988,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA90,5.0,4.0,"She is nice and teaches well. I don't think she is being unreasonable for anything. Her classroom rules are okay, nothing too hard/ weird. She often gives candies. Maybe she doesn't tell the students, but I think she gives extra credit if you have the ambition to learn English (with doing a workshop, meeting with a tutor, etc)."
6989,1489063,Barbara,Mezaki,Mt. San Antonio College,Writing,AMLA42W,1.0,5.0,"No extra credit,even though get from writing Center of our school. Almost all of the quiz get B, at final give you a C! So crazy! Often shout out to student! I cant accept her."

6992,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,4.0,3.0,"He is a great teacher. His grading is very clear on his syllabus. Prof. gives you extra credit options through participation. Honeslty, i'm not a math person and he made me feel so confident in math world problems that I now enjoy them. That alone should say alot. Plus he makes alot of jokes."
6993,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,4.0,1.0,"He is a very kind teacher. He makes class easy to learn. He makes jokes especially about his wife but not in a mean way. His assignments are not hard and the tests are also easy to pass. He will give assignments such as labs , they're just problems from the textbook. If you want an easy A take his class."
6994,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,3.0,Professor Russell really cares and it shows by his teaching! I would take him again

6996,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,4.0,"Awesome instructor!!! I recommend this professor, especially if you find math challenging. He is patient, detailed with explaining, provides practice work for test and homework, wants to make sure you understand, gives shortcuts, and syllabus is accurate. You receive points for hw assignments and make sure to get your lab hours for extra credit."
6997,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,3.0,"Good Teacher, just remember to ask questions so you will be able to do the homework, and dont be afraid to get tutoring either"

7000,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,4.0,2.0,I really recommend taking his class. He's really good at explaining the material. He's funny and really cares about his students passing .I wish i could take him again for Math 50.
7001,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,2.0,"This is my very first math class  here and I love him. I enjoy his lectures and how he put examples, so that we can learn the concept better. He make hilarious jokes about his wife. He want you to pass and not fail. If you study hard enough you will defiantly pass. Ive struggle at math my whole life and his method of teaching made me understand it."
7002,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,2.0,"Professor Russell made me love math, he's so hilarious and makes sure you understand the material if you miss just make sure your shoot him an email he's very understanding of students who do well in his class."

7005,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,1.0,"He makes sure everyone understands the lesson. The assignments are very easy, they mostly come from the textbook so yes, you do need to get the textbook. Routine in Learn 49: warm ups, review lesson, and practice word problems. As long as you show up and do all the work and pass the exams, you'll do great!"
7006,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LERN49,5.0,2.0,"BEST PROFESSOR AT MT. SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate math, but professor Russell made not want to hate math. He is very helpful, caring, and an amazing professor! I love the way he teaches, I wished he could teach all the math classes at Mt. Sac. I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE HIM AGAIN IF I COULD! (:"
7007,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,4.0,"Professor Russell is such an amazing educator! I absolutely loathed math until I took his course, he is passionate about his craft and wants students to succeed. He assigns homework, however he only collects certain weeks. The first few weeks he does board problems then he has students take over, half of lab hrs are due by midterm. Take him!"
7008,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LERN49,5.0,3.0,"Mr Russell is such a cool professor. He cured me of my mathphobia.  He's funny, always willing to answer questions and goes out of his way to  make sure you understand the coursework. Like others have said here, I would love to take another class with him if he taught a higher math. I'd recommend him to anyone."
7009,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,LEARN49,5.0,1.0,Mr. Russ is a terrific professor. Very funny and explains in ways you'll understand the work. If you hate math I promise you will love it after taking his class. Ill definitely take his class again if I could.
7010,1481871,Paul,Russell,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH49,5.0,1.0,Terrific professor! If you don't like math take him. He will change that!
7012,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,2.0,Read before coming to class because you will break off into groups to pick apart the readings at the beginning of class. It works because it allows you to get ideas for your essays that you probably wouldn't have thought of on your own. He's very approachable and cares about you passing the class. He's also pretty funny too! Made English bearable!!
7013,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. Gave alot of work, which required alot of reading. Gave very good constructive criticism on papers, the feedback was clear enough to build upon. Was approachable when help was needed. As long as you showed that you put in effort, he would do everything possible to help you earn a good grade"
7014,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,3.0,4.0,"He had a hard time with canvas, he didn't teach, and his assignments weren't clear despite handing out so many reading and writing assignments."
7015,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,Dude is super chill and will not hesitate to call your ass out if you're being dumb I swear this dude pulls the most weird facts from his ass but they are always interesting ones with like deeper meaning so I always looked forward to them gives papers but if you find a more profound meaning in all the literature you'll see how fun his class can be
7016,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"Took him for fall 2019 and I think he's a great professor. He gives you everything you need to pass, it's up to you whether you do. Attendance and reading basically makes the class and there's alot of writing but you can always ask for feedback. Overall, he was super great."
7017,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,4.0,"The textbooks are used regularly. All his homework are essays based on the books you read. His grading does become more critical, but he focuses on the amount of effort used. There are group discussions mostly every class, but it does allow you to become more talkative with the other classmates. Lastly, he is hilarious and easy to talk too."
7018,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,4.0,"Myers gives aLOt of papers. At like 2 points in the semester you'll have 2 or 3 essay's at the same time . With the essay's you're required to show proof that you worked on your essay, like 2 rough drafts,a visit to the writing center,little notes that you wrote. Also when you go in groups to talk,he hates it when you go to the same people."
7019,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,1.0,"Professor Myers really has outdone this class in the simplest, yet stressful ways possible. Although it is stressful, its mainly on you to really consider your effort in this class. This class is mainly consisted of essay assignments but is overall doable as he gives you time to do your things in the class. I recommend taking this Professor for 1A"
7020,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,I chose to take Myerss class because i wanted to be challenged academically and thats exactly what happened. He makes you think outside the box with everything you do. He encourages group work to obtain different viewpoints from each person in the class. There were a lot of essays but he grades fair and gives great feedback.
7021,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"Currently taking professors Myers English 1A class and for someone who works full-time I'd recommend taking his class. He gives great feedback, lots of content for papers he assigns and will overall make you a great writer. Definetly makes you read between the lines. He's super Woke! After a long day of work I really enjoyed coming to his class."
7022,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,3.0,"overall great teacher, you do get assigned many papers instead of homework and quizzes but he gives you plenty of time to complete them and offers extensions. As time goes by you will catch on to his grading. even if you suck at papers, if he sees you trying you will be fine, definitely recommend him for English!!"
7023,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,4.0,5.0,"Myers honestly is a great teacher, always challenging you intellectually. If you take this class be ready for A LOT of reading, and A LOT of writing! Your going to be getting essays on top of essays, with strict deadlines! Hes not one of the easier teachers, but definitely grows you educationally!"
7024,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"Professor Myers is an excellent teacher who really challenges you to expand your learning experience. He assigns a lot of reading and writing assignments, but if you stay ontop of them you should do fine. The profesor will also give you additional points if you turn in multiple steps of your writing process! I would definitely recommend you do so:)"
7025,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,4.0,"In class Myers is hilarious and will not fail to make you laugh, unless you're too stressed from all the work he gives to be able to enjoy the jokes, but out of class you're piled with not only essays, but readings as well. His class wasn't hard, just a lot of work and the only way you'd be able to finish the work is if you make time for everything"
7026,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,3.0,4.0,"He gives out a lot to read and gives out a lot of papers, so I do not recommend taking this class to juggle with others. If you become interested in his assigned readings, his class becomes more pleasant and friendly overall. The class environment involves group discussions, but overall they help with the construction of your papers. Tons of Work."
7027,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,Myers is an amazing English professor. He helps you find the deeper meaning to the stories and opens your eyes to the many possibilities in the world. He has an easy grading system. As long as you can understand and follow his teaching style the class will not be hard to pass. If you want an A you gotta work for it. He wants well-written papers.
7028,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"Professor Myers is truly one of the best professors I've ever had. His class is not an easy A, although, if you work hard and make it noticeable then it will pay off. All assignments are mostly essays that are given back to back."
7029,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite professors of all time &lt;3. He is the funniest and scariest man I have ever encountered. He gives a lot of feedback and advice when it comes to essay structure and exactly what he expects an essay to consist of. He is very social and can hold a conversation if it is interesting. He cares about his students success and is lenient.
7030,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,Influential. Amazing. Inspiring. Understanding. Really wonderful teacher that challenges you to pick up your slacks and write your heart out. This is a great class if you love to learn and want to better your writing skills for the 4-year colleges.
7031,1597964,Richard,Myers,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, if you are shy don't take his class. He likes to prepare people for the real world so if you aren't ready for the real world(Discussions,formulating your own answers,showing up, putting in actual work) then you aren't ready for this class. he will also jokingly clown on people, but it is in no way malicious and he does it for all"
7033,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,2.0,Great Professor! He is very understanding to any situation and reply to email ASAP. Always advice students to work harder so they can pass the class!
7034,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,5.0,"Professor Masoud is amazing! He cares about his students. He is understanding and very encouraging. He wants all his students to excel. I took this class during the summer which is work overload but with organization is very do able. Offers EC opportunities. He didnt lecture, zoom meetings where for clarification of material. Overall he is great!"
7035,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,"Professor Masoud is an excellent professor. He cares about the students and provides a lot of opportunities to improve your grades. Be aware if you take this class in Summer or wintertime, it is a hard class so be ready to work a lot."
7036,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,4.0,3.0,This is my first time taking an online course due to the current circumstances and professor Roueintan has exceeded my expectations. I took his course over the summer. And Professor has been very understanding/accommodating to students. He truly wants to see his students pass.
7037,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,"He is very approachable and open to questions, in fact, he encourages it. Since the class is online, the Zoom meetings are mostly for questions and clarifications. Whenever he explains a problem or topic, he explains it clearly and very detailed. He also says to send him an email whenever we need help which is nice from an online class professor."
7038,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,One of the best professors Ive ever had! Hes very supportive and love to encourage students to keep going especially during these times. He uses his colleagues videos for lectures (which are reallyyyy helpful!) I just wish he can make his own videos with his own teaching style because I think he would be really good (based on our zoom meetings).
7039,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,3.0,4.0,He provides Youtube videos for lectures but he isn't the one lecturing. He also doesn't provide powerpoint lectures. Ive taken many online courses and instructors always provide powerpoint lectures for all the lectures. It's difficult learning from a youtube video when he is the one making the exam. Nice but needs improvement in online format.
7040,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,4.0,3.0,"Great professor. Just this spring 2020 because of the pandemic, it was very difficult switching over making the class basically self taught. Overall tho he is a great professor that helped us out during this time."
7041,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,4.0,3.0,"We started out this semester before the pandemic and I can tell you even then, before all this happened, he was a very good professor. He made sure we understood the material before he moved on and spent time with those who had questions to help them understand. Great professor!"
7042,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,2.0,In the beginning for labs he is concerned about our understanding and always available to be of assistance and takes pride in his instruction. At the rise of this Pandemic he was still there for us as we needed help and seamlessly transitioned through the semester. Professor R is from my experience the best they have. You'll be lucky to have him
7043,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,4.0,5.0,"This (online) class is mostly self-study. If you're not into that, don't take this class. You definitely need to be on top of your game to excell in this class. Form study groups. Go to tutoring. Work with one another. This class is difficult, but Professor Roueintan really wants his students do well and gives many opportunities for you to do so."
7044,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,Took this course because a friend recommended him and it was worth it.
7045,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,Definitely a great teacher highly recommend
7046,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,I took this class online it was a lot of work but he cares about his students and wants you to pass but he does make you work for it. Hes a great professor and makes chem fun. I would take his class again.
7047,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,Amazing professor. Professor Masoud is very clear on his grading and gives opportunities for extra credit. Go to tutoring. Take his class you wont regret it.
7048,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,5.0,He really made the transition to online class as seamless as possible. A great professor to have during COVID!!!
7049,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,"Definitely makes you work for your grade as should all professors should, CHEM10 was definitely a fun and active course highly recommend it."
7050,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,"great professor who really cares about your grades and well being. took this class online during pandemic and he really showed us that we were win this together. Do your work and study and ask questions, then, you should be able to pass. im an in class person, so we'll see how i did. Thanks for being awesome professor"
7051,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,From being in class to transitioning online wasnt so bad! Professor Masoud was very helpful and everything went smoothly and very organized. Best professor even from the couple classes I had in person.
7052,1941372,Masoud,Roueintan,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,"Professor Masoud is an excellent professor to take! Despite the whole situation with the pandemic, he still managed to be flexible with all the classes. As long as you don't procrastinate with all the homework and study, you'll be fine!"
7054,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,5.0,3.0,"Professor Sholars is an excellent professor and aslo a nice and humorous person. If you follow the guideline, take notes, and do the homework, then this class is not that hard. She provides you a lot of extra exercises resources that you can practice, and she is willing to help you if you have any question."
7055,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,1.0,5.0,"she lacks a passion for teaching, skips classes without notifying students. her teaching includes writing on the board and solving one or two examples per an entire section. there are more quizes than actual teaching. you are really on your own most of the time. avoid whenever you can if your goal is to understand the material and keep GPA high."
7056,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,4.0,4.0,"Homework every day, forces you to stay on track instead of doing all the homework the day before the exam like with other professors. Focuses more on real-world examples and applied math. Great for physics and engineering majors. Make sure your algebra is up to par, that's where she gets you."
7057,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH280,5.0,1.0,"She is very nice person plus very nice professor , she show the work for math in class and explain it a bit . If she will explain all the reason behind those math , that will already beyond this class level which is something due with physics , and she dont force you to finish tone of homework , Exam are mostly from textbook , so do her hw ez clas"
7058,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH280,1.0,4.0,"Nice person, but not a nice professor. She creates a hostile learning environment &amp; seems annoyed if you ask questions. Additionally,  she wont actually explain the material she'll just show the arithmetic. Her exams are a lot tougher than her quizzes &amp; lecture notes. Most of the material is straight out of the book. I'd highly suggest someone else"
7059,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MAT180,3.0,4.0,"to be honest, she teaches very well. Her examples and lectures are easy to understand. She does skip steps but will answer when asked. However, she is a tough grader. Her exams have 2 parts and tricky and usually kill your grades. She skips 1 or 2 classes too every semester. If you are a math major, def a yes. Otherwise, take some one  else."
7060,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,4.0,5.0,Sholars is one of those professors that you cuss out in your head every day during the semester. You wish you didn't take her. You wish you would've taken someone else. You wish you didn't have so much work. I recently graduated as an Electrical Engineering major and have used a ton of what is learned in this course for my major. She is worth it.
7061,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH280,3.0,4.0,"I really like Joan Scholars. She is awesome to be around and more vibrant than 95% of 20 somethings I know. She knows her stuff. However, her tests were really hard. Many of the test questions were toilsome. She required her students to memorize trig identities, something I had done back in HS. It was difficult to commit Stokes + trig  to memory."
7062,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,1.0,5.0,"She keep skipping steps during lecture and expect student to understand;However, student have to ask for her to TALK about the steps she skip. Tough grader and homework is not like you will get full score if you try to do it, she grade it like a quiz!!"
7063,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH280,1.0,4.0,"grades way too harshly, randomly disappears and misses lectures without even short notice. exams are fair, but she picks the hardest questions that take forever to answer on the test. lectures are useless. avoid whenever possible"
7064,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,2.0,5.0,"Tough for summer. Exams were two parts, the first part had integration-definitely overkill . A lot is collected during the week atleast two quizes a week/homework packet. Wished she didn't give quizes, so that she wouldn't have to cram too many sections. Overall, she is good and quizes are from in classes problems ( tricky ones) ."
7065,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,4.0,4.0,"Summer. No idea how i passed with an A, but YOU WILL HAVE TO STUDY ALOT! Im serious, everyday! Hmwk issued is legit graded for points, book hmwk not so much. Tests will have some tricky questions, and can be looooong. 2 simple comp labs. QUIZES!! Very nice and is readily available after class. FAST pace, but will deff help if you ask. Good Luck fam"
7066,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,1.5,5.0,she had given 9 quizzes and 4 exams and final exam was cumulative. she would give problem in quiz or exam that might your weakness. I thought the exams were hard. she did not teach much. many time is on your own.
7067,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,2.5,4.0,Expects you to master the material right after she shows one example. You are expected to be a master of all information you had previously learned prior to the calc class. Not the clearest professor. Would not take again.
7068,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,5.0,2.0,She is good professor. She is willing to help her students even if  she is busy at her office hour. I apprciate the way she truly cares of her students if they have any problems. Just pay attention on her lecture and stop complaining.
7069,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,2.0,5.0,"Sholars is decent at teaching the subject, but I have had teachers that are much more clear and helpful with their lectures.  My main problem is with how unnecessarily hard she makes everything. Even if you perfectly understand all of the concepts, you can lose a LOT of points due to extremely tricky or awkwardly worded questions. I found it unfair"
7070,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,3.0,4.0,If your looking for an easy professor then Sholars isnt for you!! In class she goes at a fast pace but she can be very helpful during her office hours so take advantage! Also all of her old test and quizes are online so take adavantage!! Study hard and I mean STUDY!! Overall her class is difficult but you need to work for a good grade. Good Luck
7071,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,4.5,5.0,"Don't be discouraged to take her. Yes, she is difficult, but you become a better student because of it. All of the past quizzes and exams on her website were very helpful as well. Her lectures are sometimes hard to follow, but she is always helpful during office hours. I am glad I took her because now for the first time I actually enjoy math."
7072,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS DURING SUMMER/WINTER! She will torture you with tons of homework from the book and quizzes and exams that are only a repeat of her old previous courses because she hardly teaches during these intersessions for she is unorganized herself.
7073,1478551,Joan,Sholars,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH181,4.0,4.0,Fair grader! do hw and past exams. B is easy. A is tricky. Go to her office hours for help. she is always there.
7075,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"Without a doubt my FAVORITE professor, EVER. He is strict and expects a lot from his students because he sincerely wants them to excel!"
7076,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,4.0,4.0,"He is a great professor who wants his students to be better writers. He challenges his students to rise to greatness. That being said, he does not give a lot of feedback on his assignments, this is just my experience from taking him online during the Spring 2020 COVID semester. His readings will take you out of your comfort zone!"
7077,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,4.0,"If you want an easy A don't sign up for Eddie's classes. If you want to actually learn how to write and structure an essay and are willing to put in work, take Eddie's classes. I was bitter towards the middle of the semester thinking I'd get a low grade, but I kicked it into gear and ended well. USE HIS RESOURCES."
7078,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1CH,5.0,3.0,"This guy is cool. You have to read in order to do well on the essays, but that's a give in. He gives provides you with everything you need to read. He gives thorough feedback to succeed if you attend his office hours. He welcomes your ideas and appreciates feedback in discussions. He's straight up so don't be a pansy and you'll like this class."
7079,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,3.0,"To get an A you must get all of your papers checked by the writing center, must have great grammar, and know the basic elements of how to construct a paper. I am not nearly as smart than the others kids that got A's. However, I put the max effort, and I was confident. If you want an A just work hard, don not let Muniz get to you, and be confident."
7080,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,2.0,Best professor I have met in years. He is very passionate about teaching and it is clear that he only wants to give you the tools to succeed. I have learned much in his class through extreme criticism and failures. I would definitely take this class again in the pursuit of knowledge. He is very open about many topics and is very knowledgeable.
7081,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1AH,5.0,4.0,"Eddie is big brained individual who taught me a lot in his class, but it took effort to get an A. If you prefer knowledge over GPA he is the perfect professor for you."
7082,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,4.0,"Okay so he's such a great teacher but he's very tough esp transitioning from hs english to college english. the reason i wont take him again is because he's too tough to balance for the classes i plan to take, but he's definitely doable if you put in the effort. textbooks are just reading books. he is not an easy A."
7083,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH1C,5.0,4.0,"He's great, 10/10."
7084,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1CH,5.0,5.0,"on everything i love, he do be opening up my mind"

7086,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1C,5.0,3.0,If you hate English then you SHOULD take his class. Not just b/c you will learn but b/c you will actually look forward to going! The books are FREE! He prints them out for you! Every lecture will make you feel like you're stepping into the Twilight Zone! He is not as hard as others say! Follow his instructions and you will do well. Best class ever!
7087,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1C,5.0,4.0,"AMAZING professor! Explains concepts and material very well, eddie will help you understand material if you are lost. Honest grader so give this class your all. Definitely struggled a little but one of the best professors i've ever had. His humor makes the class better."
7088,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1C,5.0,4.0,eddie is a blunt person but he is a good teacher. His topics are a mix of psychoanalytical with philosophy. It is raw dark and mentally screwed up and mind blowing in that class. it is a major challenge. but a very good person who cares about his students. He dumbs everything down by using ghetto examples
7089,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH1C,5.0,4.0,I got Eddie by accident &amp; at first introduction was very intimidated by him. He gave 4 essays but go to his office hours during the week essays are due. His lectures are great and doesn't sugarcoat anything. The quizzes were not hard as long as you read the text. He genuinely cares about the students in his own way. Stick with him.
7090,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH1C,5.0,4.0,"At first, I was pretty intimidated at what his expectations were in the class. As the class went on, I began to love the class and couldn't wait to hear and discuss in the class discussions. He is a tough grader, but also very understanding. Eddie puts a smile on everyone's faces. He may be tough, but he's is definitely here to help you succeed."
7091,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,5.0,"He is a great professor but he is a tough grader, gives really good feedback attend each class because every lecture he gives is critical in getting information for your essays, Hilarious, sarcastic, if you can't take a joke you will definitely not like his class."
7092,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1AH,4.0,5.0,His focus on expanding your mind
7093,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1C,5.0,4.0,"He's not a hard grader, but he's an honest grader. He cares about his students becoming better readers, writers, and thinkers, and that's the point of college no? Seriously, one of the best professors I've had at this school. If you're not serious about showing up to class and trying, take someone else. He makes you work for the grade."
7094,1479213,Edgar,Muniz,Mt. San Antonio College,English,LIT6A,4.0,4.0,"If you're offended by swearing, be warned Eddie swears like crazy. Eddie makes the material fun, and his class discussion questions really help clarify things in reading if you don't understand it. Paper topics can be fun, he let us choose our own if we wanted. He is a pretty tough grader, but he does give great feedback."
7096,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH3,3.0,4.0,"Class was easy and had fun labs, but the grading is tough for exams. For tests, you got to read book and lecture. She provides several extra credit opportunities. The fault I would say is that she tends to fall behind in the syllabus, but she still tells you if you have a quiz/tests on time. She also makes the exams difficult so study up overtime."
7097,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,3.0,4.0,"Lawlor is a very caring professor. However, if youre not willing to work hard and show up to every class, dont take this class. She makes you work for it. And sure, her rules can be annoying, but just go with it."
7098,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,5.0,4.0,"Her lecture is really intersting, quizzes and tests are not as hard, if you prepared. And there are a lots of extra credits and bonus points. Most importantly, she has that very funny and cute personality and super caring."
7099,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,1.0,5.0,"Easy class, horrible proffesor. Anthropology is a great subject and this course material is not difficult to learn but Lawlor is terrible at teaching it and would rather focus on student conduct and study habits and note taking rather than the material. Super annoying."
7100,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1FALL,1.0,4.0,Honestly the worst professor Ive had at Mt sac. I have never had a professor who is so unwilling to work with their students. The material is interesting but she ruins it with all of her rules and blatant disregard for students who are struggling. Dont take her class.
7101,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,1.0,4.0,"Honestly, dont take her. She treats everyone like children rather than adults. It seems like theres a new Class rule every day. Her exams are ridiculous for the level of class this is. Ive only done well because I have a lot of Bio classes behind me. Save yourself the headache and avoid her."
7102,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,5.0,2.0,"She is passionate and cares for her students. Instructions are confusing though (homework/test questions), so it is crucial to ask her many questions. I rarely read the book, instead her lectures are a good way to pinpoint info for the tests and to also get understanding of concepts. Not the easiest class, but very interesting. Office hours help!"
7103,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,2.0,5.0,"Very sweet lady, but she is an extremely tough professor. She teaches this class as if you already have prior knowledge on the subject. She acts as if this is everyone's major. Exams are tough and smallest detail will give you an F. Study guides don't help at all."
7104,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH3,2.0,4.0,"She's a very tough grader and will fail an assignment if you have more then 3 grammatical errors. Not clear on her assignments and focus' on ""good study habits"" instead of class content. She once quizzed us on Machu Picchu THEN she lectured on Machu Picchu. Not sure how she expected us to pass that quiz. Save yourself the trouble. Don't take her."
7105,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,5.0,4.0,This was one of the toughest classes I have ever taken. I hated it at first but what I learned academically and personally throughout this semester was worth it. If you are willing to work take her! But it's not an easy grade. She's a tough grader and very specific. In the end I ended up loving the class and her
7106,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,5.0,2.0,"Not going to lie and say its the easiest class, but the material is very easy to learn and remember if you have interest in animals or biology. She gives many extra credit opportunities for just visiting seminars at other colleges and bumps up your test grade for improvement from test to test. Great teacher who truly cares about students learning."
7107,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH3,5.0,5.0,"Hard teacher but a very nice, and understanding professor who is trying to get you ready fro the real world."
7108,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,1.0,4.0,Simply two words: Just No!
7109,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1FALL,4.0,4.0,"she ain't even that bad bro there's literally like 3 easy homework assignments, like 4 quizzes with 15 questions each, and like 3 exams. Pay attention  and study before quizzes and tests and you'll be ight"
7110,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,1.0,5.0,"she was too hard.. too much work, tests have essay questions. I would not take her again. her lectures are also boring. if you need this class take it with someone else. I failed her class and I put a lot of effort in it."
7111,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH3,1.0,5.0,"She is a nice professor, but her teaching method is tough and expects things to be perfect on homework. The exams are timed if not finished she will not let the student finish the test. A tough grader on almost everything."
7112,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,5.0,1.0,Was really easy. Did not need the book if you took Bio 1 or High School Biology it will be an easy A. She's really clear on homework and if you participate you basically have the class done. If you pay attention to her class quizzes should be easy. Everything on her powerpoint and on the board will be on her tests. Study Guide don't use it.
7113,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTH1,1.0,5.0,Worst proffesor ever very picky on every detail on assignments and exams
7114,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTHRO1,2.5,5.0,"IF YOU ARE LAZY, DO NOT TAKE LAWLOR. She expects a ridiculous amount of work from her students. She acts like everybody is an anthro major and is expecting everybody to eat, sleep, and breathe her class. With how she acts and teaches, she should be teaching high school."
7115,1521345,Elizabeth,Lawlor,Mt. San Antonio College,Anthropology,ANTHRO 1,1.5,5.0,"Not good at alll  takes up alot of class time to talk about study habits and trying to teach how to study , but is totally irrelevent and she goes back on her word alot, one class she said we had a quiz on the second class of the week and instead gave it surprisingly on that monday  Oh and p.s. study guide is totally not helpful for test"
7117,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,3.0,3.0,"A textbook was used, but rarely. Participation does matter and is used toward your grade. Easy class, he does give exam study guides online and allows for it to be graded before the exam. He does give true or false quizzes he will let you know when a quiz will come up. He removes 2 of your lowest quiz grades, these quizzes can affect the grade"
7118,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI5,4.0,4.0,". The class be can overwhelming at first, but it's honestly easy. At least skim the readings, write notes, read his notes online, and participate (20% of grade) SG is available before exam, Study sessions with other students to write the mockup essay before exam is a good idea. He is willing to read the essay in advance and gives great feedback."
7119,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,1.0,5.0,I took this class because I needed to for credits. Professor Stone instructs the class as if everyone is a political science major. You will drown in notes and reading if you are not familiar with Government or Politics. LOTS OF POP QUIZZES. Do not recommend Stone unless this is your major.
7120,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI5,5.0,4.0,"this is not an easy class. if you are someone who struggles with writing or philosophy, do not take stone. otherwise, he is one of the best professors ive ever had. very laidback and helpful. he treats his students with so much respect. i was very intimidated by him to start with, but his class was my by far my favorite through out the semester."
7121,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI7,5.0,4.0,"If you're looking to transfer to a UC school, this is the class for you. Stone articulates the course in a UC fashion, not the typical CC professor. A lot of critical thinking, so do yourself a favor and take on the challenge to build yourself. Be prepared to work for this grade. It's a hard class,but this is preparation for upper division courses"
7122,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,5.0,4.0,"POL1 is not as difficult as you think. 3 Exams( 20 multiple choices 1 short essay and 1 long essay), but don't worry, just review and try to remember the study guide ( exactly the same in the exam ), extra credit in every exam ( essay). answering questions for participation point. He makes everything understandable. He's good at remembering names."
7123,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,3.0,5.0,Seems like he wants students to go above and beyond when answering questions. Said at the beginning of class that he will not embarrass students but he did that 2 times during the first week alone.
7124,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,5.0,3.0,Excellent prof. Accurate study guides. Organized. Clear lectures. Always available during office hours and after class. Will get you ready to transfer to a four year.
7125,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,5.0,4.0,"Yes, your grade is mainly based on 3 exams but you get a comprehensive study guide beforehand &amp; every exam has an extra credit essay worth 20 points. Focus on the study guide, PRACTICE writing the essays &amp; be as detailed as possible. Answer questions in class every now &amp; then for participation points. Great prof but he expects you to make an effort"
7126,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor. All he does is talk and pretty biased if you ask me. In my class he did not grab anyones attention that everyone was either dozing off into space, asleep, or on their phones. Class is based off of 3 exams (including) you have to pass all 3 in order to class. If you do not know anything of politics DONT TAKE THE CLASS!"
7127,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,1.0,5.0,I did not learn anything in this class. Your final grade is only based off of 3 test. There is no homework and participation is huge. I passed the class but struggled the whole way. He does offer study guides that helped a lot.
7128,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,4.0,5.0,Professor stone is a great person however his grading is really really harsh. You have to be very precise when answering on the test or hell take away points . You dont need the textbook at all  . Participation is huge
7129,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,4.0,3.0,professor stone was one of my favorite professors and totally was able to cater to my interests in political science despite me being a science nerd. He does grade participation and the homework is worth a LOT. Study the movies and lecture notes and touch up on the book and you can secure a decent grade. I got a B+ but i did not attend the XC opp
7130,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,4.0,2.0,"He's a pretty easier grader. I took this over the summer. My tips would be: participate in class, really study the bullets on the slides, and literally do the study guides. If you pay attention and look at his material (not too much the book), you will pass with an A. Also, be prepared. He doesn't like people who slack or who are late."
7131,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,5.0,4.0,"Professor Stone is very fair. His class is based off of three tests, 2 worksheets cause he drops the lowest worksheet, and class participation. The tests are somewhat hard, but the essay question prompts are posted ahead of time, even the extra credit essay! He gives you all the tools you need to get an A, you just have to put in the work!"
7132,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,5.0,3.0,"This class will be easy of you ready and use the study guide he provided. Also, worksheet answers can be found on quizlet which helps a lot."
7133,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI10,5.0,4.0,"Professor Stone is simply amazing, he genuinely cares about you. No textbook, but he has a list of books for you to read. Be prepared to read around 30-60 pages every two days. Class participation matters but it's easy to rack points. His tests are essay based but prompts are given prior. There's one research paper. Not hard if you're on top of it."
7134,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI5,5.0,4.0,"do urself a favor &amp; take this professor. I'm at a university now and he really preps you for a real university level Poli Sci course. you read and you discuss the readings. his tests are essays but he give you a week to prep for them and he offers extra credit for the tests DO THE EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU WANT AN A. Participation is essential, he's nice"
7135,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL1,4.0,4.0,In my opinion ppl who complain either haven't had or don't want a college level prof. Knowledgeable. Willing to help students who try. Available in office and by email. Posts helpful lecture notes. Tells you exactly what to study for exams. He is a great prof to have in this political environment but you will have to do the reading and study
7136,1479824,James,Stone,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI5,1.0,5.0,There are better political science professors out there. VERY difficult to get a reasonable grade no matter how much you read for it. Something about Stone makes it feel like you don't get it right. Not everyone sees things his way and needs to be more reasonable when grading. Will fail students more than he tries to pass them. Stay away!
7138,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO5,5.0,4.0,This is a science class so knowledge of physics and other basic science are necessary for this class. NOT AN ELECTIVE!
7139,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO7,5.0,4.0,"Tough prof but the class is a science class. Don't go in expecting it to be any easier than other sciences. He is very dedicated to his students but if you don't put in the effort, he won't help you. He teaches at a UC/Cal State level so class is mandatory and fast paced. READ SYLLABUS. Camping trips are fun and he brings stuff for bomb s'mores."
7140,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO1,4.0,5.0,"One of the most misunderstood professors I have ever encountered. His class was frustrating but rewarding. Be there everyday, try, go to office hours, read the material, go to extra credit and you will pass with a C. Engage. Also, there's a 3 day fieldtrip. Bortya is a professor that I will always thank in the long run. Geology is not my major."
7141,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO08,5.0,4.0,"Professor Boryta is passionate about what he teaches. Yes, he is a tough grader but if you pay attention and apply yourself you will be fine. He has really good intership opportunities."
7142,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO08,5.0,3.0,Great professor if you are willing to put in effort. You get what you work for and enjoyed taking his class. Also fun field trips and cool internship opportunities!
7143,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO08,4.0,3.0,"This prof is extremely dedicated and passionate about his class. Hes definitely a tough grader because he required more than a general understanding. Everything is in the powerpoints though so lecture is mandatory. If you do miss or have questions, prof Boryta makes himself available 24/7 (office hours and email). If you apply yourself youre good"
7144,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO08,1.0,4.0,I wouldn't take him. I had to drop out because he wasn't being clear on the material. Didn't answer questions.
7145,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO1,1.0,5.0,Unorganized. He abandoned his syllables towards the middle of the semester. The material that is on the tests goes above what is talked about in class. Everyone is failing because he is a tough grader. I dropped the class.
7146,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO8,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this class in the morning. He dishes out way to much information for a half asleep brain to retain. He expects us to remember everything collectively. He dishes out a quiz every week, full of trick questions. He acts like everyone in the class wants to be a Geologist when the fact is that most kids are just trying to transfer. DNT TAKE!"
7147,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO7,1.0,5.0,I will never understand professors that make their class so extremely difficult to the point where most of the class drops and there are only less than ten left. Its pretty sad and makes you wonder if the class is worth it.
7148,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO7,1.0,5.0,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant man. but worst professor I have ever had. He can't teach he will answer your questions with a question. It will feel impossible to pass the class."
7149,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEOL8,1.0,5.0,At first I felt that there was no way he could be THAT bad. I studied for hours everyday on this ONE class and never got anything higher than a D. He forces honors concepts into his normal class lectures. The class was impossible and killed my GPA. DO NOT TAKE if you value your GPA
7150,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEO1,4.0,4.0,"Boryta focuses on lectures more than anything. He uses a lot of puns, so be ready for those. Overall was a good professor who is tough grader, yet you really get to learn in his class. Extra credit is available and is what really helped my grade. You won't have to work too hard at home if you focus in class."
7151,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO7,2.0,4.0,If you last long enough in his class he is a pretty nice guy. But half the class will end up dropping because he is pretty tough. Although I'm pretty sure he was nice enough to help my final grade out with a B. That B was surprising because I was barely passing the whole semester and would have been more than happy to end with a C. Lots of quizzes.
7152,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,GEOL8,3.0,4.0,"Very passionate about his work. Unclear about what to study. They study guides are like bullet points with general information and the tests were hard. If you take it seriously and study all the time you have a chance. He states it clear from the beginning that, this isnt a class you can just show up for and pass."
7153,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO5,2.0,4.0,"I highly advise against taking his classes in the early mornings as his fly-like voice will instantly put you to sleep, if the way he ""teaches"" the subject matter hasn't done that already. Also, he injects unnecessary political discussion. However, he does make you work for your grade by putting in trick questions in quizzes and field trip reports."
7154,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO7,5.0,4.0,"Boryta is amazing; passionate about both astronomy and geology. He returns emails quickly, he has chocolate in his office, and he is very approachable. If you have questions about the information, ask him! He does not tell you the answer, but teaches you how to find it. He works really hard for his students, and he does expect the same from you."
7155,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO5,3.0,5.0,"Professor Boryta cares about what he teachers, you can tell. Unfortunately I didn't do well in his class. In part because I underestimated astronomy and in part because he was a little confusing about what to study ."
7156,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO5,1.0,5.0,His lectures are soo prolonged and unclear. Going to the observatory for a field trip has made 3 months of his lecture more clear for me. I would not recommend to anybody.
7157,1512640,Mark,Boryta,Mt. San Antonio College,Geology,ASTRO5,2.0,4.0,"Astronomy sounded awesome but this class was honestly such a drag for me. Very long lecture, which was boring and hard to keep up with. He was so strict on attendance and being on time. Also, the exam were difficult. He expects you to know all the equations. i won't recommend this class."
7159,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,5.0,"Professor Perez is a nice guy that sadly isn't flexible and understanding with his students. Has boring and dull lectures that have plenty of mistakes. Gives quizzes that are nothing like his lectures and homework. Does not offer any extra credit and does not curve grades. Math 180 is already a challenging class, he makes it harder than it needs to"
7160,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,2.0,"I took his class in spring 2020. He is the best teacher I have ever met. He loves his work and always gives his students a lot of help. If you follow his lectures and steps, it is easy to get A. I hope I can take his class again when I have the opportunity."
7161,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,4.0,5.0,"He is happy to anwers your question and solve any problem that you have difficulty with. However, he has trust issue. I'm taking his online class rn. I feel so stressful. Hopefully, I wont get a bad grade :("
7162,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,2.0,3.0,Makes a lot of little mistakes during lecture. If left unchanged students study incorrect information. Doesnt respond to emails. Isnt a bad professor but isnt the best. 3 exams and a final. Exam 3 is the hardest in my opinion.
7163,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH130,5.0,4.0,"I took his MATH 130 class back in 2011 and I always wanted to come back here and write a review for him. Wow, what a fantastic leader and a perfect representative of what a good work ethic and effort will do coming from the perspective of the teacher. He is always always available to help after class, too. If math isn't easy for you, take him!"
7164,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,3.0,3.0,"He has a really good personality, but it is just really all just lectures. Boring class, homework, really repetitive."
7165,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,5.0,1.0,His lecture is awesome and interesting
7166,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,5.0,HORRIBLE is the only way to describe this guy.
7167,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,4.0,4.0,"Spring 2019. Quiz every time you go to class. Each exam has more percentage weight than the previous. Go to class and do homework. Lecture teaches you basics, homework teaches more in depth, Exams are combination of both. MEMORIZE IDENTITIES!!!"
7168,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,5.0,2.0,Best professor ever
7169,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,3.0,He is so helpful and really cares about if you understand the material. He is extremely patient. His homework assignments are set up in a beneficial way and all the test and quiz questions are from the homework. Definitely recommend him as a professor for every class you can take him for.
7170,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,1.0,5.0,"This professor might be good for lower math courses but for MATH180, they are better options than this guy. He just goes over problems without asking questions or engaging with the class. Also when a student asks a question, he gets the problem set up so the student can solve it for themselves. (Which no one understands.) He isnt clear in class."
7171,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,1.0,3.0,"His lectures aren't very clear or detailed, more like he just shows you how to do it everything without the verbal instruction behind it. Quiz's were easy and graded easy but if you're someone who learns by verbal and visual instruction, i suggest not taking him."
7172,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,2.0,4.0,"He's one of those types of people where you either really like them or really hate them. And for me its the latter, Professor Perez while he does teach at a good pace lacks the proper skills needed to be a teacher. He will ask for your insight on a problem and then not care for the answer you give him."
7173,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,2.0,5.0,Professor Perez is a horrible professor students ask for help and he goes on to explain but finishes the question half done and says you know what to do from there. Cmon a student asks help cause he doesnt know what to do not for you to half do it and expect them to finish
7174,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Perez is very kind &amp; genuinely wants the best for his students. He is organized &amp; his packet of notes has everything you need to be successful. There are quizzes every class but they are helpful. Basically, your performance on the quizzes mirror how you will do on the tests. If you do the study guides you will be prepared for the exams."
7175,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH180,4.0,3.0,"He gives in class notes. His lectures are long and he really goes into detail to teach the concepts to students, not just the technique and formulas. His tests are usually much harder than the daily quizes so beware. Overall good teacher but lectures are kinda long sometimes. DO STUDY GUIDES THAT HE GIVES before tests to do well in his class!!!"
7176,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,4.0,2.0,For my first semester at mt sac i decided to take this professor thinking he was going to be mean but he's one of the great professor's I've had. Really straight forward and clear grading criteria. As long you study well and take your time learning the materials you'll be fine.
7177,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH150,2.0,4.0,"Not the best math professor for trig. His quizzes were easy, but his tests were hard. He even says his tests are hard and only half of the class passed one of the exams. He's not very helpful and often had typos on his study guide answers which were not helpful"
7178,1477756,Chris,Perez,Mt. San Antonio College,Mathematics,MATH51,5.0,2.0,"Took a pervious math 51 class and failed. Took his class and understood every section. The professor teaches all the material very clearly and goes at a great pace. Gives a good amount of homework and doesnt over work you about 25 problems each section. All homework is due on each exam day. Gives 3 tests and quizzes daily, not hard just study!"
7180,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS8,4.0,4.0,Took her Spring 2019. She doesnt do slides just talks and writes on the whiteboard the whole time (write down everything she says). The lecture style intimidated me but if you write it all down its literally the tests. I liked her class but she doesnt present herself as approachable. Im typically an A student but she grades rather tough.
7181,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST36,4.0,2.0,"There was a lot of reading in this course, but as long as you read through the chapters at least once and use the study guide provided the tests shouldn't be too hard. You do need to put in effort for a higher grade. Easy when you put in the work."
7182,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS36,4.0,3.0,"Took this class during a 6 week semester online. II highly recommend taking her online class. She assigns weekly video clip discussions,quizzes and tests. Although the quizzes and tests are fairly easy, she is a harsh grader when it comes to the video discussions. Overall easy A/B if you do the work and you put the effort into it."
7183,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8H,4.0,2.0,"Has a very outgoing personality, very funny, and knows a lot about history. 3 tests, 1 short presentation, and 3 papers with VERY specific instructions. Tests are based off lecture so write down everything from the board. Pretty easy honors class. Seems like a lot but she spreads it out. Offers lots of extra credit. Take her."
7184,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8H,3.0,4.0,"She is really nice and knowledgable about her field, but she is a really harsh grader. You need to put in a lot of time in order to fully understand the material. Go to her office hours to check over your paper. You really have to work for the A because she doesn't let anything slide. Take good notes and write everything she writes on the board."
7185,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,4.0,2.0,Not a very challenging class. Her three tests are based on her lectures and her three essays are based on the book readings. There are 5 essay questions per essay and she gives like 2-3 weeks heads up for the due date on the essays so its pretty easy.
7186,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS8,2.0,3.0,I really enjoyed her lectures and she is very passionate about what she is teaching but she is a harsh critique. I felt uncomfortable talking to her about my papers because I saw how harshly she would critique the other students.
7187,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,4.0,2.0,3 exams and 3 papers. She is blunt and will tell you to drop if you fail the first exam or paper. Easy grader and gives a study guide with everything that is going to be on the exam.
7188,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST36,3.0,4.0,"Can be rather blunt and sarcastic in her comments. Its an online class so there is a lot of reading, discussions, and quizzes. Must be grammatically correct and especially historically accurate when writing her 3 papers. A lot of work but an A is achievable."
7189,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST36,1.0,3.0,"Overall shes an adequate teacher, making sure you have all the material and resources to pass the class but the major flaw she has it that shes extremely harsh instead of giving you critiques that you can learn from and improve she blatantly puts you down, it makes it hard to want to participate because you know shell have something bad to say."
7190,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS36,5.0,3.0,"A lecture-based class. No group work at all. 2 textbooks required. 3 exams &amp; 3 essays total. 100 pts each. Fail to do one, unlikely to pass the class. Tests based on notes (which you can use on the test!) &amp; essays based on reading. Buy EE6 scantrons for exams (3 total). Totally recommend. The only downside is purchasing textbooks which cost a lot."
7191,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Makes the class interesting and exciting. A few essays; all pretty easy. I was able to get a B without much effort. Work a little harder than I did and you'll get an A. If you're looking for a good history teacher, look no more."
7192,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST36,5.0,4.0,"I had Prof Cannon for Women's History in my fall semester (side note: w/ my best friend too). To say Prof Cannon is funny would be an understatement. Her lecture's were extremely precise, but TAKE! NOTES! DON'T PROCRASTINATE! The essays are easy if you read the book. If you do the work &amp; attend class, this'll be easy. Plus, Prof. Cannon is awesome!"
7193,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS36,5.0,4.0,"If you wanna do well, take A LOT of notes, and READ the chapters. Also, DO NOT procrastinate your papers. She gives you a lot of time so use it!! She's really funny and plays a lot of music + puts on a lot of movies. Bonus: rants about Trump."
7194,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS36,1.0,3.0,"Ms. Cannon usually makes her lectures interesting, however, i dislike the fact that you can't go to her for questions. I've went up to her at least twice to ask her questions about an assignment and she brushes me off. She tells me to go to canvas and re read the assignment. she seems to get bothered and doesn't want to answer students questions"
7195,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST36,5.0,3.0,"Great lectures, really made you want to get into the course work. This lady had an air of class and power about her and was the perfect woman to teach a Women In History course"
7196,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST36,3.0,5.0,"She's a tough straight forward Professor. Write notes, read your book after you get home. Tests  are good if you study."
7197,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,4.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had. Grading was simple, only 3 review question sheets, 1 essay, and 3 exams. She's a  strong  feminist,  but you'll get along with her nicely. She can also relate to student s and is always there if you have a question or need help. Take this class for an easy B, with effort an easy A."
7198,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIS36,4.5,1.0,"Very interesting professor. Writes her lectures by hand on the board so you know the exact information she's going to test you on. Makes history fun. Papers are difficult only if you procrastinate since it's alot of work. Fun spirit, highly recommend!"
7199,1479430,Kathleen,Cannon,Mt. San Antonio College,History,HIST8,4.5,3.0,"ABOUT CLASS: 3 papers, 3 exams. Papers are long- answer review Q's from book (so yes you need the book). Very strict on how they should be formatted. Simply FOLLOW WHAT SHE SAYS &amp; you'll be fine. Exams are mc &amp; essays (3 short, 1 long). Take good, detailed notes. Does give study guides. 1 short group presentation on the New Deal- not a big DEAL ha"
7201,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,3.0,3.0,Dropped her class once we switched online due to covid. For the little time I had her she was an okay teacher. Two required books and assigns readings everyday. Research paper is based on a movie of your choice but she give you a list.
7202,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,4.0,"Professor Estrada is a great professor, but do not take her if you think its gonna be an easy A. You have to complete the work and get the grades in order to pass! She is very knowledgeable."
7203,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"Professor Estrada is such an amazing professor, I would highly recommend to take her English 1A class. She is very caring and her class lectures are enjoyable."
7204,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,2.0,Professor Estrada is one of the best professors I've ever had and made me excited to go to class every morning. I would take her again in a heart beat! The class is an easy A and the reading are honestly pretty interesting. You can tell she really cares about her students and really loves what she does. Professor Estrada is amazing to say the least
7205,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,2.0,"Estrada is the best! Read the book, and you'll be alright! She gives ten short pop quizzes of the stories you read at the beginning of class throughout the semester. The essay prompts are also straightforward; go to her office hours for help, she will give you feedback on your essay! Two in-class essays (one is the final) and two home essays."
7206,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,4.0,"I was able to take Professor Estrada this semester for ENGL1A and I really loved her class. She is passionate about teaching and it makes the class a lot easier to absorb. As long as you DO ALL YOUR WORK (!!), read, listen to her feedback, ask questions when you don't understand something, be prepared to succeed! Thank you very much, Professor!"
7207,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"I really loved Professor Estrada, in any class you would have to work for your grade so as long as you follow what professor Estrada asks you to do, you will do fine"
7208,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"This class is what you make of it. If you try your hardest and give your effort, Estrada will care for your grade! This is the best english professor I have very had! If you dont understand her writing, then ask! She appreciates the students that put max effort, so if you show up late everyday and dont do the reading, dont expect an A!"
7209,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"I really recommend taking Professor Estrada. I know for many English can be an intimidating subject as it was for me, but the class environment was very accepting and easy to work in. Professor Estrada was also very clear about all of the assignments and her essay topics were very engaging!"
7210,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"Best English teacher Ive ever had! Its not the easiest A, but do your work and youll be fine. Would 100% take again."
7211,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,3.0,"Really good professor she tells you exactly what she wants in her essays, gives extra credit I would take her class again"
7212,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,Professor Estrada is a great teacher. She gives good feedback and grades fairly. Her research project is probably the best research project I have ever been assigned. She provides you with interesting articles throughout the semester. Remember to take a workshop any chance you get because it could help you so much!
7213,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG068,3.0,4.0,"you have two in class essays and three take home essays. She gives you feedback but you can't understand her writing. You also have ten quizzes throughout the semester. I had a family emergency the day an essay was due so i missed class, I tried talking to her so i can turn it in later that day and she said No!"
7214,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,68ENGL,5.0,4.0,"Awesome professor; she is very organized, gives great feedback, and cares for her students. This class was no essay A, but you will learn. Overall I would recommend Professor Estrada to anyone who likes organization, clear grading, and interesting reading. )"
7215,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,68ENGL,5.0,4.0,Amazing teacher and she is very funny. She gives lots of Take Home Essays(4) and In class Essays(3). Be ready to read a lot but the books that she made us read. you will love. You will have 10 pop quizzes as well.
7216,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL68,4.0,4.0,"She was so sweet and caring. I've taken her once for English 68, and will be taking her in the Spring for English 1A. She gives helpful feedback. However, she gives a quiz about once a week, so be sure to read. Overall she's funny and caring  and I got an A!"
7217,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,5.0,"Professor Estrada gives a lot of essays, homework, and oh boy pop quizzes as well. The thing that bothered me the most was that when she grades essays you completely cannot understand her handwriting so I never knew what I was doing wrong in my essays therefore I couldn't improve in them. She also loves to fail her students, trust me. Beware."
7218,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL68,4.0,3.0,Got A's on B's on my essays even though i would have many grammatical errors ...
7219,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,4.0,1.0,Professor Estrada is very nice and cares about her students. Gives good feed back on all papers and offers office hours. Fairly easy class if you do the work and ask for help if needed on the papers!
7220,1487886,Maria,Estrada,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,2.0,"She is such a sweetheart! she's very helpful, especially if you go other office hours because her feedback there can really help you do great in your essays. I've taken her twice and will be again. absolutely love that she is clear in class syllabus."
7222,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL3,5.0,3.0,Super fun teacher and he kept the lectures really interesting. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Homework everyday but very short and easy. Open note tests.
7223,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL1A,5.0,1.0,Great Professor. He cares about his students.
7224,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL1A,5.0,1.0,"This Professor knows his Logic. He cares about his students and he is there for you. Just do what he tells you and you will be fine. He has extra credit and if you need to see him in his office, you can confer with him. I liked him very much. Attendance is mandatory. Great class."
7225,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL1A,5.0,3.0,The best teacher ever!! Super caring and cares about his students. If you skip his class you will not pass!! Homework every class but super easy and boosts up ur grade if your tests are pretty low. He also offers extra credit! He wants you to succeed.
7226,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL3,5.0,2.0,"He is honestly one of the best Philosophy professors I have taken. He is incredibly engaging and makes it really hard for you to fail. I would recommend showing up to every lecture on time as it counts as extra credit, but also make sure to do the homework and reading. He is not heavy on the lecture and applies concepts to real-life instances."
7227,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL3,5.0,3.0,"He made intro to logic so easy to learn and understand. his class is very straight forward and he is very engaging with his lectures. MUST do the homework, grade is weighted heavily on homework. attendance also matters. he gives a lot of extra credit opportunities!"
7228,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL3,5.0,2.0,"There is HW due every class but it isn't hard. It takes about an hr to complete. HW is a major part of your grade. His tests are open book/note which makes it easy. Which is why HW matters more for your grade. Half the time is spent going over the previous hw, then quick group work. The last 15 min are a quick lecture. Easy but sometimes boring."
7229,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL110,5.0,3.0,"He gives a lot of homework, but it's not that difficult if you read the textbook, he's super great!!!"
7230,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,2.0,"I didn't take an online Intro to Phil in favor of a brick-and-mortar class, and Prof. Komrosky delivers. Coursework is clearly explained and you'll only get less than an A if you skip class or do an abysmal job on the written assignments. I wish my fellow students would discuss and debate concepts more, but Prof. K brings the best from the class."
7231,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,2.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had in a purely academic sense, but also my favorite personally because of his upfront and down-to-earth personality. He's a former special forces soldier turned radiologist who teaches philosophy for fun and is amazing at it. He excels at simplifying very esoteric and complex material. Wish I could take again."
7232,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,2.0,One of my favorite professors.
7233,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,3.0,"Joseph is a modern day hipster philosopher, he is wise and hilarious. Youll pass his class as long as you try, and if you try youll not only pass but leave with new wisdom."
7234,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,2.0,"I took Professor Komrosky for Intro to philosophy. Hes a great professor and offers a lot of extra credit opportunities. The lectures are pretty interesting and there is a lot of discussions and interactions. The class is super easy just show up, listen, and participate"
7235,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL1A,5.0,2.0,He's great dud
7236,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,2.0,"(Warning) I suck at writing. I love this teacher. He prefers students not to take notes but his lectures are so interesting and interactive you dont really need them. I promise if you, do homework, use his studie guide and pay attention when he goes over it you could get through this class with at least a B."
7237,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,2.0,"He is funny, and he is an easy professor if you read and finish all the work. Most of these works are readings, take home quizzes, take home critical interaction paper, and take home reading reports. You will have no problem getting a good grade on these paper if you read. He also gives take home answers for mid and final exam."
7238,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,3.0,"Professor Komrosky is a true delight, i will skip all other classes in the day and wake up just to come to his class, he fosters an atmosphere of friendship and understandingHe will answer even the most obsurd question in a hilarious and meaningful way, while providing a real discussion based on your logical extreme. 10/10"
7239,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,5.0,2.0,"Professor Komrosky is an amazing Professor. As you go throughout the semester, you can tell hes very passionate about philosophy. He grades every paper fairly and his tests are pretty much on the study guide that he provides. Hes very funny and a well respected professor. I highly recommend taking his class in philosophy!"
7240,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL1A,5.0,1.0,"He is white and German. Also, dont skip class cause it will result in lowering your grade. Overall, the class was easy. Lot of reading, but relatively easy since its just philosophy. There are quizzes every week that are submitted in class involving the reading required."
7241,1979933,Joseph,Komrosky,Mt. San Antonio College,Philosophy,PHIL5,4.0,2.0,Has a great sense of humor and makes lectures enjoyable even when the content can be difficult to understand at first. There are also a lot of extra credit opportunities that are offered as well!
7242,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,1.0,5.0,"TOUGH GRADER!! i cannot stress this enough. if you dont do an assignment right she tells you to take a look at the module again and just doesnt explain how your work was wrong. also tells you to see a tutor, but i would not need to see a tutor if she just explains things well!!"
7243,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,LIT36,1.0,5.0,"Do you want to write a 2000+ word essay that will be graded like trash? No? Well don't take this class if you don't want to be crushed by quizzes and tests that you will spend all day working on. Although I still like mythology, this professor is the worst person to make someone want to expand their knowledge."
7244,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH1A,1.0,5.0,On-campus it was very difficult so transitioning to online I knew it would be more difficult and it was... She was very unclear w/ assignments. I would always have to email her but yet failed to explain. The tc was helpful but definitely do not recommend this professor. I failed and turned in every single assignment&amp;would receive 0 credit for them.
7245,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,3.0,4.0,Class was taken from in person to online due to COVID Modules were hard to understand TAs are your best friend use the written center Study the absolute list Study MLA Format! 2 books are required but mostly use 1. This class was not easy &amp; made harder by online transition. Prof Hight is very charismatic. In person class was very entertaining
7246,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,3.0,4.0,Do not miss class!! Everything this professor says is crucial! She is intimidating but encourages question. The entire class is set up to challenge you in many ways other than just dumping homework and quizzes on you. Plan on going to the writing center alot. This is a hard class. do not take unless you are ready to put down the hours.
7247,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH1A,1.0,5.0,Makes you feel stupid for asking questions
7248,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,2.0,5.0,"Just her as a person, she isn't mean. As a teacher, she doesn't explain very well and won't answer your questions, just telling you to go ask the TC. Just do the work on time and you'll hopefully pass. She's also very strict when it comes to essays that it gets frustrating."
7249,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,5.0,"This was my first English professor for the fall semester. I kinda regret taking this class literally regret it!!!! she doesn't know how to teach or explain the work and always say to go to the writing center. I went every Sunday got the help I need and still would give me a bad grade. Beware of her quizzes, a lot of homework and panel Report!!! :("
7250,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,4.0,gives waaaayyyy too much busy work
7251,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,1.0,4.0,Do not take her!!!!! Wait another semester if you have to !! I barely passed and I put my soul into that class
7252,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,3.0,4.0,"She is honestly a really good teacher. She is a really tough grader, shell mark you off on grammar and words she doesnt like in essays, BUT she cares about her students, she is really clear and gives you examples of how she wants you to format assignments. Shes a great teacher, you just have to listen in class, and do what she wants in writing."
7253,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,5.0,Im so good in English and once I took her its like I went from a A to a F in English. She gave me a D on an assignment because I wrote over a half of page. I thought more was better but I guess not. Also she likes to talk a lot like non stop.
7254,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,4.0,I took her class for Spring semester because it was the only class opened. I had read all the comments about her before and all of them were right. In her eyes EVERYTHING is PLAGIARISM and D&amp;J. All my papers received a C+ or a D because of D&amp;J. You have to skip lines on her in-class essays or automatically marked with a bad grade.
7255,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,5.0,"She takes her shoes off in class and switches to some high heels that she can not walk in. The best way to describe her is the MLA Nazi. her favorite words are plagiarism and D&amp;J( if you take her class you will understand) I only took her class because they switched the CRN numbers, so I was forced to take her."
7256,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,3.0,4.0,The first half of the semester I started to hate the class because she dings you on every mistake and doesn't tell you what good you actually did; just bad. Sometimes she can come off as condescending. She actually knows a lot. Take advantage of office hours. Don't take this class if you don't have time to study. You will need to study. Get ready.
7257,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,3.0,4.0,The first half of the semester I started to hate the class because she grades in a way that makes you feel like you don't know nothing. Sometimes she can come off as condescending. That's just how she is.. it sucks. Take advantage of office hours. Don't take this class if you don't have time to study. You will need to study.
7258,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,5.0,"when it comes to grading, the word ""ridiculous"" us an understatement. for  example, on our VERY FIRST quiz, when it came to my answers, i got a perfect score, but just because i did not skip lines, she gave me a 0. again, i repeat, OUR FIRST QUIZ. don't do it people, just don't do it!!"
7259,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,4.0,"currently enrolled in her class, WHAT DID I GET MYSELF INTO!? All of these negative comments are 100% true. i am passing ALL of my classes w/flying colors except this one, &amp;English is my strongpoint. . . (writing the rest of my response on another comment)"
7260,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG67,1.0,5.0,"I took her for credit and i didn't pass. She is very vague with directions when giving homework, class work, and help in general. In my opinion i don't think she was very professional. She would constantly take her shoes off in class and give a ton of a homework. Do not take her unless you are ready to work harder than her. :(a"
7261,1548151,Lynette,Hight,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG67,1.0,4.0,"Grading is difficult and not very clear. Didn't post grades anywhere, and when you asked her about your grade she didn't know."
7263,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,5.0,3.0,Tries hard to make an online class interesting. Two news stories and some quizzes and a feature story. Nice lady.
7264,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOURN102,5.0,3.0,"The most understanding professor I've ever had. Kind, experienced, funny and willing to work with you when things get tough. Work is clear and story drafts are turned in before final story is due so she helps with those too."
7265,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR108,5.0,3.0,Toni is an amazing professor!! 10/10! She was so understanding with our situations because of COVID. She really cares about her students. Take her! Have a conversation with her if you can. She is very knowledgeable. BEST PROFESSOR EVER!
7266,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,4.0,2.0,"Took Toni during COVID and it was chill. She gives guidance but the class is almost self taught. You have to find your own stories and be creative. A few story pieces, 2 tests, short writing prompts, and some tweeting. She is really sweet and the class is laid back. Gives decent extra credit. Solid choice if you need any journalism classes."
7267,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR114,5.0,4.0,"This professor is awesome. She has a high level of enthusiasm for her job and she keeps classes very entertaining, and she will reply to your DMs as soon as you send them. Overall very helpful and was a fun class to take."
7268,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR108,5.0,2.0,Taking this class made me realize that I want to do public relations after transfer. Toni is an excellent teacher who cares for her students and who really knows the field. I plan to transfer in the fall and am prepared to move on thanks to her guidance.
7269,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,2.0,3.0,"Okay, you can use your phone, miss classes and turn in late work, but I found her really disorganized, takes forever to grade papers, and too many projects. Goes off on tangents. Take actual classes if you must like 101 but stay away from the student media cause too much drama and too much work"
7270,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR108,5.0,4.0,Fun class. Great instructor. Learned a lot about the career I want to work in.
7271,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,5.0,4.0,A real nice professor who cares greatly about her students. Has a lot of patience and always there to help. Teaches more than news writing. I learned about social media and think I want to major in journalism now that I get there are lots of careers that aren't just newspaper work. Tests are part open book and she gives a chance to rewrite stories.
7272,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR108,5.0,4.0,"To succeed in this class you have to like group projects because the class is based on working with real clients and setting up your own public relations firm with a group. I learned more in this class that I realized, especially when I began my internship in PR and used all the skills I learned in Toni's class."
7273,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR114,5.0,2.0,Fun class making videos for a social media series. Toni creates a class where all ideas are welcome. Three projects and a final and no written tests.
7274,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR102,5.0,4.0,Toni is the kindest and most knowledgable professor on campus when it comes to journalism. She brings her experience to all of us and makes her classes interesting. The workshops she gives on gaining an audience for writing has changed the way I look at my social media presence and how I write. No one better.
7275,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,1.0,1.0,"She's very nice but very flaky. I think students like her because she's easy. If you breathe, you get credit. If that's for you, go take her, if not, take someone else."
7276,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR102,5.0,3.0,Very clear on assignments. Relates all assignments to real life journalism. Lectures are interesting. Allows you to write to publish. Learning about social media promotion in classes. Nice person
7277,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,5.0,4.0,She is funny. I love going to class. She loves journalism and will make you love it too. She really cares and helps you get published.
7278,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR108,5.0,3.0,Found out about Toni while taking Gina DePoala's class when she came in to talk about the journalism program. I didn't know we had PR at Mt. SAC and I'm so glad she came in because I signed up for her PR class and I'm hooked. Toni really knows the business and gives you a positive outlook for working in this field.
7279,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR114,5.0,3.0,Kind and caring person who just wants to see you succeed in life. Learned so much from her.
7280,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR114,5.0,3.0,Toni is the best. Took her PR class last semester and loved it so decided to go for the degree and took JOUR 101 and 114 class in spring. The class is easy to manage and her assignments are clear. She and her assistant Jessica go out of their way to help you succeed. She's also a great person to talk to about careers. Takes time to get to know you.
7281,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,2.0,3.0,"She is a nice/cool professor but I would advise you to really be serious when taking her midterm and final because she does not give partial credit if you get the question wrong and you can easily fail the test. She claims that what we are being tested on is easy, yet she never gives us practice until after the first midterm when everyone fails."
7282,1652061,Toni,Albertson,Mt. San Antonio College,Journalism,JOUR101,4.0,3.0,Learned a lot. Emphasis on journalism style of writing but very interesting lectures.
7284,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"Quintana is the best! Take her if you can! She offers 50 E.C points and gives valuable feedback on assignments. She undoubtedly wants her students to succeed and will help you with any questions you'll have. She made the transition from a physical class to going virtual natural. However, you must put in the time to get an A because it's a lot."
7285,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1C,4.0,3.0,Overall this class wasn't too difficult. The assignments are pretty straight forward. There's quite a bit of reading and most of the assignments are essays. This professor is pretty easy to contact through email or by attending office hours. At the end of the class there is a large group project that's worth a good portion of your grade.
7286,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,1A,5.0,3.0,"Professor Mullane is the best. Her class was tough, so you have to put in effort to pass this class. But she is very helpful and understanding. Going to her office hours is a plus because she is patient and gives really good feedback and ideas for your essays. There is a lot of group activities and one group oral presentation."
7287,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,4.0,3.0,"I loved her class and way of teaching. Made class very entertaining and not boring. I learned a lot from this class, and would recommend it. Essay grading is a little tough but also all English professors are. Offers extra credit and many opportunities. As long as you do your work you will pass."
7288,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"Had Quintana for fall'18, it was pretty difficult work load wise but she is a very nice and caring Professor. She truly cares for her students and sets them all up for success in her class, as long as you put in effort to read the books you will be okay. There are also a lot of essays in the class, so going to her office hours will help you."
7289,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"An amazing teacher that taught me better than anyone w passion and respect. This professor assigns amazing books and articles to read. As having english as my second language, I expressed myself and felt comfortable on my writings and orally in class activities. Grading is fair, I would recommend to work hard for the essays and not procrastinate."
7290,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"Professor Quintana is an excellent English professor. she gives clear direction. offers many great ideas for your essays. her lectures are amazing and intriguing, you'll never get bored. she gives very good feedback on essays. Quizzes are take home but not too difficult and there are opportunities to earn extra credit"
7291,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,She gives good feedback on essays. Quizzes are take home and not to difficult. She gives extra credit for pretty easy items.
7292,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,5.0,1.0,"I really enjoyed taking Mullane in the Summer and Spring of 2014. Her class was not boring at all for me. She picks interesting prompts for the class to write and she even gives out options at times. She is great at giving feedback and is happy to help you. She's funny, nice, and interesting in person!"
7293,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG67,5.0,4.0,"Clear lectures, follow her instruction on how to write an essay do your work and you will for sure pass her class."
7294,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGLISH1C,5.0,3.0,The topics that are talked about are very informative and interesting. Makes it comfortable for students to ask questions and makes students feel comfortable to interact with each other. Its easy to pass her class as long as you go to her office hours for feedback.
7295,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,1A,5.0,3.0,"Does give a lot of essays, but she is easy to pass as long as you go to her office hours. She gives many chances and has easy ways to receive points. Her class discussions are fun and interesting."
7296,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,One of the best English treachery Ive ever had. She didnt make us buy a book she printed one out for us. She was very straight forward as to what she wanted and she always made lectures memorable.
7297,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,Highly recommend her she is a great professor her classes are intriguing .She is a tough grader but she gives so much feedback and is willing to help!!
7298,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,4.0,4.0,"I had Ms. Quintana during the Summer and she was such a wonderful woman! She really cares about her students, but sometimes she might get snappy or mad when students do not participate in acitvities. Make sure to do your essays earlier because she really is a tough grader. I recommend taking her if you actually want to learn, really good professor."
7299,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,5.0,4.0,"Kim was the BEST professor I have had. I took her for English 68 in the fall of 2015. Her subjects were extremely interesting (studied music videos)and her classes follow a theme, ours was rooted in pop culture. She opens your mind to look at things beyond the surface. She is a tough grader but you will not regret this class. TAKE IT!!"
7300,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,2.0,1.0,"I didn't like her.  She's a TOUGH grader, graded really hard on ALL of my assignments and my friends for the smallest things.  She would correct my thesis, even though is was her exact thesis I copied down.  She dictates your opinions and makes you write what she thinks."
7301,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,3.0,"She's enthusiastic about her job everyday. She dedicates her time to helping her students become better writers. She gives feedback on essays and conducts thought-provoking class discussions. Also, her style and personality is great!"
7302,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1A,5.0,4.0,"MRS Quintana is amazing! I believe my writing did improve with her. even when you make a mistake, she tells you instead of just saying its wrong. her lectures are interesting and passionate"
7303,1485441,Kimberly,Quintana-Mullane,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG68,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst professor, I've ever taken. She is such a tough grader, and will mark you off, if she thinks your sentences doesn't sound right, even though it sounds completely fine!. Under any circumstances, DO NOT TAKE HER!!!"
7305,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,5.0,4.0,"Lots of work! Make sure to watch lecture videos, read lab information beforehand, and do both the study guide and outline (2 things yes). But this is all made up for with a thorough study guide, and extra credit on quizzes and tests. She'll answer all questions and is very very carrying!! I promise you input  output in this class. Don't slack ��"
7306,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,1.0,5.0,"Was really nice but she has lots of lectures to watch and the quizzes and exams are timed so there is no time to even read the question. Very tough class. Would not recommend, especially if you are taking other classes."
7307,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,5.0,3.0,Great teacher! Lots of homework and quizzes but it is a higher level class so that should be expected. Definitely incorporates lots of different aspects of learning to appeal to everyone. Very clear and detailed on what she expects. One of the best.
7308,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,2.0,5.0,Unorganized lectures. Lots of videos and links you need to watch for each lecture.
7309,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,5.0,4.0,"Biology is not my major, but Janine made it fun. I'm glad I took her this semester. The outbreak made it easier for online assignments."
7310,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO20,1.0,5.0,"Although her lectures are detailed , her tests tend to be very hard .She expects you to memorize around 10-17 essay questions depending on which test you are taking and she will have four on the test and can choose to write out three of them so you pretty much have ti memorize all 17 because you do not know which ones will be on the test."
7311,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO20,5.0,2.0,"-PROS: clear notes, good lectures, extra credit, exams quizzes come DIRECTLY from notes, easy to approach, nonmandatory attendence -CONS: hw, HAVE to study, quiz every week (easy tho) -TIPS: An easy A if you study and do EVERYTHING she tells you to do (vids, notes, lectures), its hard to hate her since shes extremely nice and approachable"
7312,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,3.0,4.0,Was really excited to take this class but have been seriously disappointed. Her teaching structure is all over the place. You are required to do a lot of learning materials on your own. Lab and lectures quizzes every week. She does give an out line and essay questions outline to study before hand but over all she is hard to follow.
7313,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,5.0,2.0,Professor Kido is by far my most favorite professor I had at Mt. Sac and I'm not a science major! She's really caring and understands things happen outside of life that we can't control. Her lectures are incredibly clear and she has a lot of supporting files/slides on powerpoint that can help you get that A+! I didn't get an A+ due to my work ethic
7314,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO20,1.0,5.0,Made an already difficult class more complicated. Introduces material instead of teaching it. Skips over material. Much of the work as she states is for students to learn on their own. Endless amount of long videos to watch on top of double sided thick exam packets to go through. Quizzes every week. Avoid. Study bio with someone more accommodating
7315,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO20,2.0,5.0,VERY tough grader! Gives an OVER abundance of work with high expectations of students knowing info thats only introduced not actually taught. Expects students to learn too much on there own unfamiliar info instead of teaching it!!! Isnt consistent with teaching structure leads to bad learning foundation for students.
7316,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIOL20,1.0,5.0,Excessive amount of work and information to be memorized
7317,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO21BIO20,5.0,2.0,Professor kido is the best marine biology professor ever!!
7318,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,5.0,3.0,Great professor! She prints out the lecture for you which is very straightforward. Every lecture there are quizzes and the day of lab. Study guides are given except on the lab final. If you want an A be sure to study the printed lecture notes 3 weeks beforehand and know the packet inside and out. And she drops the lowest quiz!
7319,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIOL1,5.0,3.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER. TAKE HER!!! I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF TAKING SCIENCE CLASSES BECAUSE MY ENGLISH ITS NOT THAT WELL. BUT HER PASSION TO TEACH WAS INSPIRATIONAL TO ME. AND ALWAYS MADE ME WANT TO GO HOME AND READ, STUDY AND WANTING TO KNOW MORE. NOW, AM NOT ONLY BLESS BY HAVING HER AS A PROFESSOR, BUT GOT THE CONFIDENCE I DID NOT HAD WITH MY ENGLISH."
7320,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO20,5.0,3.0,"Janine is wonderful! Class is always engaging and interesting, and her lectures are clear and detailed, easy to understand. She gives outlines to fill out while going through lecture, which makes it easy to study. There's very little homework, and very little reading. There are lots of videos to watch outside of class, but they aren't very long"
7321,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIOL21,5.0,2.0,"Kido was a great choice for my lab credit! I took her for lab only and it was easy and fun. Memorize all the taxonomy (which isnt a lot)&amp;youll pass. She provides practice quizzes on her website and updates your grade there. She drops the lowest quiz, out of 10 quizzes. You get 4 exams. The labs are so much and easy,&amp;you interact with new people."
7322,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO20,5.0,3.0,"I took her marine lecture class in Spring. It was hard at the beginning but it will eventually get easier. She prepares worksheets which some will be covered in class and some you have to do it on your own. The exams and final are based on the worksheets she gives us. Basically you will get an A if you go to class, do homework, and study."
7323,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,5.0,3.0,"JANINE WAS A GREAT PROFESSOR. I TOOK HER OVER SPRING 2016 FOR LECTURE AND LAB, AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP UP. EVEN THOUGH I BARELY WENT TO LECTURE ( BECAUSE I WOULD GET MY NOTES DONE AHEAD OF TIME) SHE DIDN'T BASE MY GRADE OFF OF THAT. I GREATLY APPRECIATE HER, AND DEFINITELY RECOMMEND HER. ITS BIO DON'T EXPECT AN EASY A. WORK FOR IT!"
7324,308350,Janine,Kido,Mt. San Antonio College,Biology,BIO1,5.0,3.0,Professor Kido is AMAZING! She really gives you everything you need to pass the class with an A. 4 Exams but she gives you a study guide for each one. Really approachable if you need help. I really enjoyed her lectures and she made the labs easy. Highly Recommend!!!!
7326,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM50,4.0,4.0,"He is a very nice professor. He is willing to answer all your questions. if you have something messed up, you can ask for the breakout room and you can ask questions one on one."
7327,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,4.0,4.0,"I am not so sure as why the ratings are so low and insulting! We were in a pandemic, he made several experiments by recording himself at home, kept lecturing online, held office hours, and basically was there for us. Is he hard? Yes. But chem 51 is harder than 50 and I had to work twice as hard to get a B. Study and he will help you out. Good prof."
7328,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM50,4.0,4.0,"Doesn't deserve current rating. Very passionate professor who knows how to express subject material concisely. Answers questions with just as much clarity and respect. However, his classes are always very hard and he can be strict."
7329,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM50,5.0,4.0,"I took the placement exam to exempt me from taking Intro so I went straight to this class accepting the fact that I'd have to work harder for a good grade. As for any student, just put in the time &amp; ASK QUESTIONS! He is very passionate &amp; does an amazing job teaching the material &amp; WANTS you to succeed! Going to do my best to get him for CHEM51!"
7330,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM50,1.0,4.0,"THE worst professor I have ever had. Lectures are very unorganized and all over the place. He constantly forgets things, gets mad when you don't understand, lacks empathy for students &amp; when we went online, he made the class more strict and more difficult instead of being understanding. Expects us to be prepared but he can't match the same energy."
7331,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,2.0,4.0,He gives you way too much homework assignment that are due the next class period. The lecture doesnt seem to fit with the homework and he gets mad when the students dont answer his questions. Its not the students fault he does not explain his lectures very well.
7332,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,5.0,4.0,I loved this class! I usually hate chemistry but prof G made this class easier to understand. You do have to put in the work though. If you dont study enough or do the homeworks then everything will be confusing. His exams are exactly like his lectures and he gives extra credit for showing up. Just be on time hes stern about that.
7333,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,1.0,5.0,Lectures had little to nothing to do with the tests. No test review. You MUST have prior knowledge of chemistry to pass this class. Rarely updates grades so you never know how you are doing in the class.
7334,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM50HCHEM51,5.0,3.0,"This class isn't easy but thats how all chemistry is. Prof. G is very passionate about chemistry and is very helpful to his students. His exams are very tricky but as long as you do the homework and listen in class you should be prepared. His grading scale helps too! (88%+ is an A, 78% is a B,... etc.) Just show up, ask questions, and study."
7335,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,1.0,5.0,I just dont know why he has to make the class harder when it is just for GE. I get it chem is hard but this class is not that hard he gives zeros on homework if one question is wrong. Exams are tough for that level of chem. I took chem 50 after and I got an A so was jot my problem then!! Worst prof.
7336,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,5.0,4.0,"Professor Golestaneh is probably one of the best professors I have ever had. Yes the class is a lot of work, but its chemistry so it should be. The lectures are filled with plenty of information that is definitely going to be on the test so you dont wanna skip. But the lectures are fun and interesting. Lots of homework but it helps out with tests"
7337,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM50,4.0,3.0,"Many people are confusing the difficulties in learning chem with this professor being difficult. There are many arbitrary things you have to memorize in chemistry, some students find this frustrating and will direct their anger towards the professor. If you pay attention, read the book, and do the work, you'll have no problem passing."
7338,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,5.0,3.0,Honestly the class was not that hard as long as you showed up and did the work. Most people that didn't like the professor didn't show up for class or even show interest. Come on people its a college course you actually have to do work if you want a good grade. Prof. G was great! super passionate about chemistry and really cares about his students
7339,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,5.0,3.0,Professor G is great. Chem 51 isn't easy but he went above and beyond explaining the material and going over any homework we didn't understand with the class to make sure everyone understood the concepts. I would definitely take his class again!
7340,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,5.0,3.0,"Definitely not an ""Easy A"" class but as long as you show up on time and show that you are trying you will do well in the class. Professor is very passionate about chemistry, he knows how to make tough material understandable and fun. A lot of note-taking, book required for homework but offers a lot of extra credit opportunities and is very helpful."
7341,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,1.0,5.0,Absolutely terrible and horrible professor. Dont take him if you want a C or lower.
7342,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,1.0,5.0,"Horrible. Unclear due dates, unclear assignments, tests are bull. His exams are full of stuff he doesn't teach and it's all conceptual. We use a very bad free book that is horrible at explaining and all the answers in the back of the book are wrong so no use doing/checking homework. Assigns work everyday, lab reports everyday, goes off topic"
7343,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,2.0,5.0,"You have to have to be good at chem to take this class. Super unorganized but he is nice, I almost feel bad for rating him so low but beware."
7344,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,1.0,5.0,One of the hardest classes of all time regardless of how hard u study and how smart u are this class is absurdly difficult. His test are note even close to the practice problems in class and no I wouldnt recommend him for a student.
7345,1486266,Kamran,Golestaneh,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM40,1.0,5.0,he is a straight awful teacher doesn't even have a study guide before tests and quizzes and half the class dropped
7347,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI9,5.0,4.0,I love professor Simon. I had him for POLI9 during the fall of 2019 but ended up having to retake it. He really cares for his students and is so funny. I retook his class during spring of 2020 and passed with an A. It took a lot of work but it is very manageable. Good Luck
7348,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL9,5.0,3.0,"He is a real gem in poli sci dept. very sarcastic and friendly. learned so much from his class. he isnt as hard as others say! It can be a bit challenging sometimes. But take notes, do the reading, fully engage in class, and write an outline and have him check for you before exam. You'll get an A!"
7349,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,5.0,4.0,"I swear one of the funniest teachers Ive ever had, by far the funniest professor Ive had... but hes no slouch, he expects to best out of papers, and nothing less than the best will fly. 100% recommend taking his classes!!!"
7350,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL2,5.0,5.0,"Dont let his quirks or lectures scare you because you will walk out of his class as either an improved student or dissatisfied. Grade is based off 3 exam style essays that require textbook references and lecture material. He gives you an exam study guide a week ahead. Altho his class isnt easy, YOU WILL work and learn to get that A."
7351,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,4.0,2.0,"Curtis is a great professor. He breaks down everything to every detail. That could be a good thing but sometimes we only get stuck on one thing for the whole class that sometimes it feels like you didnt learn anything. If you are an audio learner go to him. No visuals, just notes and speaking. His lessons are interesting and no class work or Hw"
7352,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL2,5.0,4.0,"Took him for both Poli 2 and 9. The reviews sound like a broken record at this point and I'm going to contribute to that by remarking he is indeed funny, energetic, and using the textbook is an unsaid requirement for getting an A or B."
7353,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,4.0,4.0,Nice guy and funny but the lectures can be kind of boring unless youre interested in this kinda stuff. No homework except for studying for exams. Exams are essays but you get the prompt a week before. If you arent good at writing this teacher is not a good pick for you. Its not an easy A. You need the book. Participation is 5% of final grade.
7354,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL2,5.0,4.0,"Its not an easy A. You have to work for it, but if you are in his class to learn, and want to be challenged then this class is for you. Attending class is important, exams are essays in class which you can prepare for a week before. one of the Most organized professor i've seen. Take him if you want to learn. He is hilarious!!"
7355,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,5.0,4.0,"Honestly the best professor Ive ever had. This isnt even my major and its my favorite class ever. Although his exams are essays and theres only one other assignment, he will definitely give you everything to be prepared and engaged in the context. I thought I hated political science but now Im thinking of changing my major to it because of him"
7356,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL9,1.0,5.0,"This class wasnt a political science class, it was more of a history class. He lectures extremely heavy, speaking extremely fast and he jumps from one subject to another back to the other and then to another. His tests are in class 10 page essays. He takes attendance every day and they count as participation points."
7357,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Simon is a super nice &amp; funny guy. Make sure to go to class, he lectures with no PowerPoint so taking notes is essential. The exams are straightforward, all in-class essays and he gives you the prompt plenty of time beforehand. You must refer to the material you read from the textbook if you want an A on the essay! Participation counts too!"
7358,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI2,5.0,4.0,"Honestly one of the best professors I have ever had. Took him for int. relations and comp. pol. and I wish he had more classes in other subjects. Don't take his class if you expect an easy ""A"". There wasn't a single day where I didn't get a good dose of laughter."
7359,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI9,4.0,3.0,POLI9 is harder than POLI1. The professor is funny and is well-rounded in his subject. There are two exams and one final (all worth 30% of total grade). I struggled a lot in this class bc I didn't know what to write. Managed to jump from average B to A at the end from hard work. REMINDER: READ AND CITE A LOT FROM TEXTBOOK (AT LEAST 7-10times).
7360,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,5.0,3.0,"He is one of the best professors I've had. He is a very unique professor, he loves to joke around and very passionate about politics. he gives three exams which are in class essay. he gives the prompt a week before so you can memorize your essay. if you refer to the book in the essay and participate 5 times in class you will get an A. Take him!"
7361,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI9,5.0,3.0,"Curtis really made me a better person and a student with new perspective. He is such a great professor and cares for his students! For the tests, read the book and quote at least 8 times for an A. The final is super easy! If you need help, he emails back very promptly and office hours he'll be there. Interested in poli sci? TAKE HIM!!"
7362,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI9,3.0,4.0,"3 written exams, writing assignment, participation pts (required to speak 5x) Lecturesincredibly dry and I found it hard to stay awake. provides a study guide week before the exam to help you prep. He is pretty accessible and responds to emails fairly quickly. Prof. moderately funny and tolerable. Make sure to include quotes from txtbook min. 10X"
7363,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI9,5.0,3.0,"Professor Simon is an outstanding teacher, really funny and interesting lectures throughout his class. There are 3 essay styled tests (He gives the prompt a week before so you can prepare), study from the lecture notes AND from the textbook and the A is yours. Easy class, doesn't assign any homework, just study and attend the lectures!"
7364,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,5.0,3.0,"Professor Curtis is one of the best professors I've ever had. His class consists of 3 exams, all essays. To do well, you need to quote form the book. If your writing is weak, then it may be a bit difficult for you. You have to memorize all the info, but if you start right away, then it will be easy. His lectures were very engaging. And no HW."
7365,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POL2,5.0,3.0,"Professor Simon is one of the best professors I've ever had. He keeps lectures moving at a good pace and genuinely cares about his students. Be ready to participate, because it counts as part of your grade! The exams consist of short answers and essays - as long as you do the reading and take good notes in lecture, you'll be fine. Take his class!"
7366,1490109,Curtis,Simon,Mt. San Antonio College,Political Science,POLI1,4.0,4.0,He is very funny and super corky. Although his classes are ALL lectures and he has no PowerPoint to follow. He keeps you entertained though. His tests are all written except the final. His tests are very hard and he rarely gives out As. I had a 4.0 until I got a B in his class. He is a super nice guy and loves participation.
7368,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1H,5.0,2.0,"I recommend taking this course in summer/winter. Super easy and straight forward. She provided a free book pdf online, 1 discussion, and 1 analysis assignment weekly. The tests were not too bad, just be sure to read. Not a tough grader, just do your work. She allows 1 missed discussion or assignment, but you can do it for extra credit!"
7369,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1H,5.0,3.0,"This class was so much fun for summer 2020! Book was online, one discussion, and one analysis assignment each week. The test were difficult but you are allowed two attempts &amp; she takes the highest grade. Make sure to read the book. Offers a lot of extra credit. Allows one missed discussion/analysis assignment or it can be used for extra credit"
7370,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,5.0,3.0,This class was pretty easy. Mostly read a few things and write what you think about it. Answer her questions thoroughly online. Id defiantly take this class again. Made me feel involved. She cares about us a lot.
7371,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,3.0,2.0,"Took this class Fall '19 &amp; I must admit, this class bore me. There were some interesting topics but everything else was tedious. She relies on PPT's but can go off topic at times. There were days where we would watch videos. She does let you use a card for tests. An online book is also provided. Overall, She's nice and cares about students passing"
7372,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,5.0,2.0,Professor Gallarde was inspirational. If you ever had doubts about taking Sociology no need to think twice.

7374,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,5.0,3.0,"She is amazing, inspirational, and interesting! Yes her rules are strict but its understandable.

She offers good amount of extra credit as well. Thanks :)"

7376,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,5.0,3.0,"Don't expect the nicest teacher, she's straight to the point. But she's also amazing. The best way I can describe is that she's very strict about her rules, but her rules are pretty relaxed. She never asks for too much and she also is very organized and on top of her game. A great teacher, fully recommend."
7377,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher. Didnt think i would like sociology but she made it so interesting and fun i always looked forward to her class. Very easy class just take notes and study and you will be fine. The book is free online ,I used it to study. Very interesting lectures and gives opportunities for extra credit. But I ended with 100%. Just show up to class."
7378,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,5.0,2.0,"A good choice if you want to learn about sociology, but don't want to be overwhelmed with work. Took her for winter intersession and the class is more than doable. Wish I took her class in real life, but she seems kind and thought provoking in her online discussions as well. Readings are mostly short and textbook is free. Definitely recommend."
7379,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,SOC1,4.0,2.0,"She's really funny and cool, I love the stories she'd tell in class.

I grew a deep interest in research and she was very helpful. She gave us the textbook for free and we had polaroids for our projects. Also, she printed our final projects for us! She was outstanding, an amazing academic woman. TAKE HER!"
7383,1474413,Marlene,Gallarde,Mt. San Antonio College,Sociology,D10,5.0,2.0,she is absolutely amazing !

7389,1477438,Michelle,Dougherty,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENG1C,1.0,5.0,"she is the worst professor forever. grades are based on complete or incomplete. It means, no matter how hard you work on your papers, if you have a few mistakes, she will give you incomplete. I dont recommend her."
7390,1477438,Michelle,Dougherty,Mt. San Antonio College,English,ENGL1A,5.0,4.0,"She definitely deserves 5/5 overall ratings.

He posts lecture videos for every chapters that are very easy to understand and most of them are on the tests. He is available on zoom twice a week to help you with any problems. As long as you do whatever he tell you, easy A."
7411,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,"He is really good! I taken this class online and his lectures is amazing, you really can learn something from him."
7412,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,2.0,4.0,"Todd clements makes his students study for a specific chapter, but once the midterms come, it has nothing related to the chapter. He made it very stressful when everything turned into online, and seem to not have an understanding of students having other classes to focus on. Gave lots of hw, that did not count for our grade. Bad teacher for online."
7413,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM50,5.0,3.0,"Very good at explaining every concept. Gives extra credit, practice exams. He is fun and makes his lectures are interesting and engaging. Long lab reports, make sure you start early. Amazing professor overall"
7414,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,2.0,"This is my first semester. My friend introduces his ""chem 10"" to me. He is the best professor ever. For me, It's Easy A.

7415,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,2.0,"His class is the best class Ive ever taken. I dont like chemistry, but I like his chemistry class.

7416,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51H,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor who knows how to teach and have great understanding to all of his students. If you're looking to learn with a pretty lenient to fair workload, this is the person you want to choose."
7417,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,4.0,5.0,Overall a solid choice to take chem 51 with. He really tries to breakdown concepts at a meaningful level then apply it to the science. However class is very lab and exam heavy. Most brutal part of the class are the lab reports (needs to perfect in format and calculations) and overall Gen Chem 2 is very difficult. You gotta work for your A.
7418,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51H,5.0,3.0,"Overall, Professor Clements provides us great time and experience over the semester. He offers amazing lectures to go over the course concept in detail. He is also welcome any sorts of questions and he is willing to work with u. However, Lab Report is a huge part of the grade. Make sure u really work hard on it if u are looking for a good grade."
7419,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,5.0,4.0,I didnt get some assignment grades until the final was posted.
7420,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,"I took this in the summer, it was a little intense. Professional, gifted at teaching. He explains concepts clearly . Gives plenty of extra credit and answers any questions you have about the material. Do practice exams and get A!Energetic and full of excitement. He once rode his unicycle in class. I WOULD TAKE THIS PROF FOR ALL MY CHEM CLASSES!"
7421,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,Overall he was a very good professor and made the material more relatable which helped to understand it a lot better. He offered extra credit opportunities before exams as well as office hours. He's Alsop a very good at having grades posted up to dat and as soon as possible.
7422,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,I took this class in summer and it was a little challenging because it's a lot of information but it is manageable if you study. He is clear on the information taught and is available to answer any questions. He is funny and class is never boring. I would recomend to take him for chem10. I learned a lot and i enjoyed it.
7423,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,Best prof. i have ever taken so far. Extremely passionate about teaching and inspiriting to earn an A in class. Make sure to work on sample exam &amp; review lecture notes in advance!
7424,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,5.0,4.0,"Pros: Professor Clements really knows how to teach!!! He's super smart but unlike most genius, professor Clements can explain the most complicated in a matter a monkey can even understand.. class material isn't too difficult.. cons: You will have to work for it to get an A.. assigns lots of busy homework.. assigns lab report for every lab..."
7425,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,He is absolutely amazing! Took him for 7:30 in the morning and he made the class so enjoyable! he kept us awake and engaged at all times! You know he is very passionate about his teaching. He basis all the materials in real like situations. He helps use see a bigger picture. He will teach you things you never knew before .
7426,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,4.0,"Best Professor Ive ever had.!!His lectures are amazing, never boring, hes passionate and loves chemistry. His test are hard, only if you dont show up to class. Grading is easy, gives a lot of chances to receive points. Is willing to help with any questions you have. He makes chemistry fun! Definitely recommend this professor to anyone!"
7427,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,2.0,Best chemistry professor!! Very Helpful! His lectures are never boring! Attendance is important because then you won't understand the quiz or the exam! Which by the way are easy! only if you understand it.
7428,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM51,1.0,5.0,"Not very helpful, usually regurgitates the back when you ask for help, doesn't really explain things clearly when asked. Homework is often nitpicked for minor mistakes and requires Mastering Chemistry. On the bright side he does put on good shows with some of his experiments or displays and his lectures are pretty interesting to follow"
7429,1798045,Todd,Clements,Mt. San Antonio College,Chemistry,CHEM10,5.0,3.0,"Best Chem Prof ever! Highly recommended to all. Clearly goes over subjects and breaks it down simple. Do online homework, 3 exams. Percentage grades."
7431,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,5.0,5.0,"As a person, sweet and caring. As a professor, so confusing and complicated. I got an A by the skin of my nose. Tests are heavy and very confusing so study hard and well. If you can, take no other classes. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT, ALL OF THEM IF YOU CAN. Don't be afraid to ask her for favors regarding grades, she's very flexible and nice."
7432,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,3.0,3.0,"I won't lie, you have to put in work for Professor Julie's class. As long as you show up everyday, do the homework/reading, and listen to the lectures you should do just fine. I did learn a lot in her class and it was definitely an interesting experience. She also does group work related activities every week."
7433,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,1.0,5.0,"This class ruined Astronomy for me!! I took the online course and it was the worst decision I could ever possibly have made. The whole course was confusing, tests were extremely difficult and a lot of lack of communication with this professor. If you want an easy A class, DO NOT take this one! Worst class I have ever taken :("
7434,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR8,1.0,4.0,"So much homework. Doesnt explain anything just overall bad , powerpoint presentations are very vague. if you ask a question it gets answered vaguely. nothing on her study guides are on her powerpoint . FINAL IS CUMMULATIVE WITH NO STUDY GUIDE"
7435,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,1.0,4.0,Don't take this professor. The questions on the study guides ARE NOT on the tests. 10 test + final. HW assignments have questions that's barely talked about in the book. I was interested in Astronomy and taking this class killed it. You basically just learn how to do complicated math formula.
7436,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,3.0,4.0,"Cool outgoing and passionate professor. Only issue I had as well as a few other classmates is understanding the material she presented in class, felt like a foreign language. Would recommend this class to an astronomy lover or to those who don't mind reading. Do all the projects(which are easy) and you'll be fine."
7437,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,4.0,3.0,"Honestly not a bad teacher, just pretty boring at times. Easy to get a decent grade as long as you do the extra credit for exams and do well on projects. I got C's for both exams and terrible on quizzes and still got a B because of in class activities and projects."
7438,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,1.0,3.0,"I attempted to take Julie Bray-Ali's online course ASTR 8. I sent her a message requesting assistance with the homework. The professor failed to answer my question nor continue the conversation to assist me in her homework assignments. In laments terms, she left me hanging. Dropped the class because of poor communication."
7439,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR5L,2.0,4.0,"She can be very hard to understand in lecture, sometimes not very specific or confusing explanations. Doesn't give feedback in homework, or tell you correct answers you missed on tests or homework, making it hard to study since you don't know the correct answers. Extremely hard grader. Not a horrible teacher, just very difficult."
7440,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,AST8,2.0,3.0,"I found myself struggling to find the motivation to come to this class. Lectures were sometimes fascinating, other times they sounded like another language and I found myself confused by her choice of words. Often times the lectures, homework, and quizzes seemed to have information that did not prepare us for the tests."
7441,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR5L,5.0,4.0,"Astronomy was like another language to me, but Julie helped break it down. This class was tough, but I actually learned something new and now I have an appreciation for the Universe. Julie is passionate about Astronomy which made the class more interesting. As long as you do the work you will pass."
7442,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR08,5.0,2.0,"Julie is AMAZING. Astronomy IS a science and is hard to understand if you're not in the class with her. SO TAKE HER LECTURE CLASS! She's absolutely a great teacher. I took her Fall 2016. She makes the subject super interesting and beautiful. If you have a love for the sky and stars, take it. Take with a friend/partner so you guys can enjoy it!"
7443,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR8,4.0,4.0,"She's actually a great professor, BUT if you know nothing about astronomy, don't take her online hybrid class during intersessions. This was pretty hard and there's a lot of projects. HOWEVER, also a lot of extra credit. Just make sure to do the moon observation and pray it isn't cloudy most of the time so you can't see the moon  I'm salty"
7444,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR5,4.0,3.0,You can easily get an A in this class as long as you do the work. If theres anything you miss she does let you do extra credit. She keeps the class interesting and is always there to help!
7445,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTRONOMY8,2.0,4.0,"The online hybrid format is so tedious and confusing to navigate. You only meet up once a week so if you have any questions about an assignment in between a class session, good luck becausr she never responds to emails, even if the question you have is not found on the syllabus. And you better hope you get perfect weather for the Moon Observations."
7446,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR8,5.0,5.0,Speaking honestly she was good. I had no knowledge of anything in astronomy going in so it was a bit tough for me. She assumes you know certain terms but in all fairness if I read I probably would've understood more. She is very kind and loves her job.  If you have questions always ask. She actually made me think about changing my major.
7447,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTRO8,5.0,3.0,"Julie was AMAZING. She's super beautiful as a person and physically as well so it's easy to pay attention. Knowing your peers helps tons as it's easier doing work with others! Her lectures are great and the homework can all be found in the book/lecture slides. Take her class, it's not overwhelming at all. Only the subject is, you'll fall in love."
7448,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR8,5.0,3.0,"My first year attending college and she is my first professor. I LOVE HER CLASS!! I was getting an A, until i had to add two more classes :(. She has such a passion for Astronomy and loves her job. Sit in the front rows, participate, go to study sessions before class they really help with retaining the material."
7449,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR8,4.0,4.0,"Professor Bray-Ali is very personable and knowledgeable. I took her hybrid course and it required a TON of reading. She offers a lot of extra credit which I HIGHLY recommend doing as her class is not the easiest. Weekly discussion boards need to be completed as well as multiple tests, two exams and one final. Overall a great professor."
7450,1534808,Julie,Bray-Ali,Mt. San Antonio College,Science,ASTR8,4.0,2.0,Homework&amp;Quiz once a week. 2 midterms 1 final. Exams are a combination of multiple choice and written. Provides study guides. Allows you to use an index card with information for the exams. textbook was required for homework only so you can just use library copy. offers before class study sessions every week. Lots of points available. Extra Credit!
7452,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,3.0,2.0,"He is an OK prof. However, sometime post assignments late and less time to finish it. Overall, if you stick with him you will end up with an B or A in you work a little hard."
7453,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,5.0,4.0,Will definitely recommend him for any student who wants to learn
7454,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,2.0,4.0,Good luck getting any help from him because he will take days to reply or won't respond. His assignments are due certain times instead of before midnight. However it still won't be graded for another 4 days so I never saw the point of that. If you are experiencing issues he expects you to contact the IT help desk for his assignments that HE created
7455,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,5.0,3.0,Doctor Ali is one of the best IT professors in The northern Virginia area. supreme knowledge and great personality.

7458,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,1.0,4.0,"Does not explain the material properly, most of the homework is online. If you plan on hurting your gpa just take him. I wish i had never taken him. Made a mistake"
7459,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,5.0,2.0,"Very Accessible outside classes. There are ""teachers"" and there are real ""Educators"". I think I learned from him more programming than any other instructors in the field. What he explained made all of my past negative experiences into crystal clear asset I am using in my everyday task. Wish NOVA had more educators like him."
7460,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITE221,5.0,3.0,"Extremely Good instructor. Attend all classes, you will be surprised how well you master all the topics of presentation. Do the projects yourself. Compare it with the solutions he presents after the due dates. You have no choice except LEARNING. Tests are coming from the textbook mainly and some from lectures."
7461,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,5.0,1.0,He is a very nice person. Stay after and ask a lot of questions if you really want to learn. Also be an active participant in the class.
7462,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,5.0,3.0,BEST PROFESSOR AT NOVA! HE TRULY CARES ABOUT HIS STUDENTS AND WILL STAY LATE OR SET UP A TIME TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL. TAKE HIS CLASS YOU WONT REGRET IT.
7463,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,1.0,5.0,THE WORST PROF EVER. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HIM.
7464,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,1.0,5.0,This is an awful class with no proper syllabus. This professor does not work with logically. You can see random questions on exam that are unrelated to your book chapter. The second thing which is unacceptable that he always come late and insisted us to stay late at night
7465,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,4.0,4.0,He doesnt accept late work but I think the amount of work he gives is decent for the class.
7466,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,1.0,5.0,Professor has no knowledge about Java. He teaches you wrong code. Actually uses decades old methods for coding which is tiresome. If Nova wants to keep him please send him for training so he can do his teaching stuff up to date!
7467,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,5.0,3.0,"Professor Soleymani is one of the most knowledgeable men I have taken for IT. He is extremely knowledgeable and wants his students to learn. He answers questions in a timely manner and in detail. I don't understand how people could talk bad about his class, You have more than enough time to do the assignments. However, the exams were a bit tough."
7468,75504,Ali,Soleymani,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,5.0,2.0,He teaches the class step by step through the book and answer all questions patiently. He knows student concern and help you to get best result.

7476,350831,Richard,Pellerin,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH271,5.0,1.0,"If you're good at math, you may find his class less challenging. If you practice&amp;you know you're good at math take an honors class. Otherwise,if you don't really want a challenge but just want to learn from someone who can teach Calculus well,take him. He used a calculator once in the semester, which shows that he is an expert in his field."

7479,350831,Richard,Pellerin,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH285,5.0,1.0,"Pellerin is very clear about topics and problems you should work on before taking the test. His explanations were so clear and informative that I didn't even have to use the book to prepare for exams; all essential notes are given in class. The study guide of exams is given, and it's extremely helpful because it reveals the topics included in exams"
7480,350831,Richard,Pellerin,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH173,5.0,2.0,"He is amazing!! He is seriously the best math professor ever.

 He will teach you math in the simplest way. You will get an A if you attend class and do the hw, and not because this is an easy class, but because YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MATH."
7486,350831,Richard,Pellerin,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH291,5.0,1.0,"His class is balanced in a way that if you're just trying to get credit and don't care about what is being taught, that all you have to do is the HW and the test problems are identical. If you genuinely care about the topic, he'll never refuse to show you how and why things work. Also he's really nice and has awesome cheesy math jokes."
7487,350831,Richard,Pellerin,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH272,5.0,4.0,"Pellerin does not give much room for error. 4 tests, will drop the lowest grade and count the final test twice. It's really easy to screw up your grade, but you will definitely learn the subject. I managed to leave the class with an A no thanks to hard hard work, Pellerin's help &amp; practice. HW is not mandatory, but you will regret not doing it."

There's really no point in emailing him for he'll wait till the entire course is over to grade. I took his online 8-week course and sent him a couple emails for help, have I gotten a reply back? Nope. Don't take his class. He's a tough grader and for what. It' an SDV class."

7514,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,5.0,5.0,"I love Westerhoff, his lectures are so good. Sometimes he does go a little fast but it's because there is so much material. I never had a teacher before who derives the techniques like Westerhoff and I am very appreciative of that. The videos he has on his YouTube channel are some of the best out there. I look forward to taking MTH 266 from him."
7515,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH286,5.0,5.0,My review from the MTH264 summer course. This professor is one of the best I have ever seen. He is not easy but you will learn the material at a deeper level. I am taking MTH265 now and using his techniques which makes calc 3 a lot easier to understand. If you are willing to commit to the work then you will learn a lot. Take him!
7516,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH286,5.0,4.0,I disagree with the comment below and there was no such email sent. I took Mr. Westerhoff's MTH 286 course over summer and he did a superb job in teaching the material even though it was offered as an asynchronous course. The videos he provided were excellent and better than what's on YouTube.
7517,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH286,1.0,4.0,"Professor had emailed multiple students personally letting us know we shouldn't be in his class, because our cameras for Zoom are poor quality. Professor doesn't do a good job at explaining anything. He assigns work and doesn't explain how to do anything. I understand teaching over zoom may be difficult, but shouldn't be an excuse for not trying"
7518,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,4.0,"A real gem. You could tell he poured his heart out to make tons of example videos and give live lectures for the compressed 6-week summer session. A reasonable workload for the compressed class time. Midterms were open-book because they're at home, but the more highly weighted final was timed, so it was tougher and you needed to know material."
7519,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,5.0,3.0,Prof Westerhoff is the best and smartest prof at NOVA. I am definitely going to take Differential equations and Vector Calculus with him. I took the Honor CALC II with Westerhoff this semester during the COVID-19 situation. I have to say his way of teaching is better than Khan Academy and YouTube Videos. Be ready and Take him you wont regret!
7520,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH262,5.0,4.0,"Professor Westerhoff is very caring. His classes are good although he can be a little late to show up to them. The exams and projects, however, are difficult. Homework is pretty easy."
7521,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,5.0,4.0,"Professor Westerhoff has been very helpful during the COVID-19 situation and good at answering emails on time. During the remote learning he has made very good quality videos for us. They are so good and detailed, even better than Khan academy videos. Calc 2 is hard but that is expected and grades are to be earned. Thank you for everything!"
7522,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT003,2.0,5.0,"Prof Westerhoff has not been helpful at ALL during this COVID-19 situation. It is difficult to learn math when the professor doesn't put in as much effort as needed for a math course. Hopefully, you have a better experience with him in the classroom."
7523,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH262,4.0,4.0,"Westerhoff is a good professor. However, he just teaches hard classes like Calc II which is what I'm taking. He prepares students for tests well but if you don't come to class you will fail. If you want the A, you'll definitely have to do work outside of class, not because he makes the class hard. Just because the classes he teaches are loaded."
7524,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH266,5.0,5.0,"Professor Westerhoff is 100% the smartest professor at NOVA, caring, and hardworking. You need to respect the class fully to perform well. The key is to do all the homework and understand the theory/concepts FULLY. He's a great professor if you're really trying to better yourself."
7525,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH266,4.0,4.0,"westerhoff was one of the most intellectual professors that I have ever met at NoVA. He was a person that will make you learn the material at a deeper understanding so you can be prepared for the upper level math courses. The only wish I had is that he curved his test scores, which would greatly help peoples grades. Maple software is used in LA"
7526,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,4.0,He is a great prof. who makes you earn your grade. If you are looking for an easy professor then look elsewhere. If you are planning to go into STEM then I believe he is the best choice for math. He will teach you the fundamentals and a whole lot more.. He also posts his notes online which is a blessing in itself.
7527,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,3.0,4.0,"Prof Westerhoff is an amazing person. However, his lectures are heavy and he gives A TON of hws through WebAssign. His tests are very hard. You really have to work super hard to get at least a C in his class. He lets you do corrections on the test, but gives no extra credit. If you're not a math person, do not take him."
7528,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,4.0,5.0,"He was very understanding. Also, he always posted notes online from class with formulas and work-out probs. One caveat is that there is a ton of hard homework and the class exam avg was often low. Calc2 was difficult, but he really challenged his students to learn the material, and I think it's is truly helpful for the future and much appreciated"
7529,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH174,1.0,3.0,Very hard course its all about how much work you put in to earn a good grade. his lectures are very long and does not provide with study guide for any of the exams. Exams are worth 60 % of your grade. Do not take him if you are not a good math student. Very hard course and you will need to study hard to earn a decent grade.
7530,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH174,5.0,5.0,I took calc2 and some other math courses with Mr. Westerhoff a few semesters ago and currently at NYU majoring in EE. Looking back now I'm very appreciative of his teaching. His expectations are much higher than other profs but you will learn a lot more. I worked very hard in his classes but now it's paying off. Thank you professor!
7531,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH266,5.0,4.0,"The professor is very good but you have to put in the time and effort to study. He is not going to hand-hold you like some other profs. Will teach the material as if it were a ""real"" college math class. I am definitely learning a lot and look forward to some of the applications. Take him if you want to gain knowledge."
7532,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH266,2.0,5.0,"Took him for calc2 (5 cred) over summer. Thought a 3 cred linear algebra over 16wk would be easier. NOPE! He thinks everyone loves math and treats this class like it's worth 5 creds. The grading is exam heavy, and the exams are difficult, even if you study. I'm usually a solid A student, but this prof is killing my grades. DON'T TAKE! BE CAREFUL!"
7533,641962,Matthew,Westerhoff,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,4.0,4.0,"Mr. W was a bit ditzy at times and needed to be corrected occasionally. He was a good professor and gave plenty of examples. The grade comes mostly from the tests, with attendance and hw thrown in there for some booster points. Hw is not graded on completion, but on accuracy-- be careful. Tests are also graded this way with limited points."
7535,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,1.0,He's awesome honestly you won't regret it at all! Best NOVA teacher! It doesn't matter what class time you choose his lectures are pre-recorded so you can watch whenever you want! AND he tells you what's on his exams you literally can't fail unless you're doing absolutely nothing. EASY A
7536,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,MKT101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Larry Edwards is great, his online class is dynamic and interesting. The textbook is free and very good. This semester we had to create an ad for this class. The class includes many assignments and quizzes, 1 research paper and 2 big tests worth 300 points each. For this tests it is important to study hard. I highly recommend him!"
7537,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,2.0,"He is honestly one of the best teachers I had in my life time. Especially during this pandemic. Very easy going, interactive with us, and if we have a question he will answer it during class time, any time. Also if you want to contact him, he will respond within minutes or hours."
7538,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,MKT201,5.0,1.0,Mr. Edwards is the best teacher in campus! He is so clear and easy to understand. He takes his time to answer questions and make sure nobody is behind. He makes the class look so easy that if you pay close attention in class you don't really need to study much for the test. Just don't miss a class and as questions! :)
7539,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,5.0,"I think Professor Larry Edwards has a great technique from the 1st day of class until the last day of class, he starts everyone off with an A and each person creates their own destiny, This Professor gives you all the tools that you need to succeed in the class and prosper in life"
7540,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,2.0,Hes a must take if you want to learn about business and at the same time be successful in class. One of the best Professors Ive taken and couldnt make everything more accessible and clear.
7541,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,1.0,"Best teacher I have ever had in during my time at NOVA. NOVA is so lucky to have a teacher like professor E. If you're planning to take any business class, please just pick him, you won't regret it."
7542,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,3.0,"He's by far one of the best professors I've taken at NOVA. He knows his stuff very well and is by far the greatest professor. I took 6 weeks summer course and there was some work to do but it was expected since it was a short semester. He is very easy to reach outside of the class and wants every student to succeed. Take him and you won't regret,."
7543,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,2.0,"Professor Edwards is really chill and he does all he can to ensure you pass his class with at least a B. I took him for 6 weeks over the summer, it was a little intense but that's how summer classes are usually are, but it was nothing too hard and his VLRs are very helpful and his tests are straight from the worksheets you do. study the worksheets"
7544,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,3.0,"Prof Edwards is literally the best professor I have ever had. Nova is extremely LUCKY to have him. he is fun, has experience, and extreme knowledge of the material. Just do the worksheets and you ll be fine on the exams. He makes us love the subject and is always available to answer questions or any confusion we have. Take him, you'll never regret"
7545,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,2.0,"A wonderful professor and lecturer. If you have questions, definitely ask, he is more than happy to assist. I don't recall attendance being mandatory but showing up is obviously essential to passing any class, be there!! Study your vocab words, worksheets, and the slides posted on canvas. He has a great personality and loves teaching us his craft."
7546,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS270,5.0,1.0,"He is amazing, just take his class and youll never regret it I promise"
7547,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,3.0,"He's a really nice guy, probably one of the best Business professors out there. If you show up, take notes, and participate in the discussions you'll have an Amazing experience. Attendance is mandatory, but you'll forget because the class is worth coming to everyday!"
7548,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,2.0,Professor Edwards is an awesome teacher. He is inspiring and NOVA is lucky to have him. He really has a desire to see every student to succeed.
7549,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,1.0,Prof. E is literally the best of the best at least to me. If you do the worksheets it will help you pass the test. He is honestly so good you won't regret taking him. I drove like 30 mints to get to the campus and it was totally worth it. Thank you Professor E.
7550,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,1.0,"I had the great opportunity of taking BUS100 with this wonderful Professor. He cares a lot for his students in class, answer questions, reviews for exams, homework to help understand even more the topics. Everyone in my class was glad to having him teaching. I would strongly recommend him. Im sad I may not to take more classes with him"
7551,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,2.0,Professor Edwards is the best! He's kind and caring and very funny which makes the class more enjoyable and he wants you to learn and have a good time in the class as well. You must get him for BUS 100 you won't regret it.
7552,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,3.0,Prof Edwards is literally one the best teachers I've ever had. I recommend going to class &amp; doing the WORKSHEETS that aren't for a grade but as a personal benefit bc the tests look almost identical to the worksheets. His test are a little hard because they're open ended &amp; the terms on the test are multiple choice. His class is super fun!
7553,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS100,5.0,2.0,"BEST PROFESSOR!!!! wish i could take another class with him. genuinely looked forward to going to his class and weirdly enjoyed studying and taking his tests because i felt that i was truly learning. super funny guy and VERY enthusiastic and energetic which makes you want to pay attention. tests are very straightforward and easy, he helps you a lot"
7554,1117613,Larry,Edwards,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Business,BUS280,5.0,3.0,This professor is a genius!
7556,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MT154,1.0,5.0,"Please don't take him. If you want to struggle, go ahead, but for those who are not so good at math, this professor is not your match. Expects his students to firmly understand the material, when in reality he doesn't help at all."
7557,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,2.0,4.0,"honestly feel kind of bad for him, but I would definitely not take this class ever again."
7558,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,1.0,5.0,Do Not Recommend.
7559,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH163,1.0,5.0,"This professor is absolute worse. I showed up to class every day and his lectures do not make sense. HE TAKES POINTS OFF FOR THE MOST UNNESSCERAY THINGS. He purposely wants his students to fail. he's very rude and told us we should be failing his test. In this class, you really need to look up things on your own because his lectures will not help."
7560,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,An autistic snail with one eye could teach this class better than Bredeck. Save yourself the trouble and take the class with the snail or anyone else even online will be better.
7561,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,Save yourself the trouble and take anyone else I didnt take the advice I read here and I took him and it was a huge mistake. I would have way rather taken this class online rather than Bredecks class.
7562,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,Im telling you the only reason I got an A is becasue this is my third time taking this course so take it from me. CHOOSE ANY ONE ELSE TO TEACH YOU. Even a squirell could do his job better than him.
7563,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH271,1.0,5.0,"I absolutely regret taking his class after reading all of these reviews about him... All of them are true, don't take him!!"
7564,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC173,1.0,5.0,"If you want an F take him, goes over concepts dosent show us a single problem... How are we supposed to do hw IF YOU DONT SHOW US HOW TO DO IT! The worst professor ever, get ready to watch hours of videos at home to teach yourself."
7565,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,1.0,5.0,"Worst Professor ever. Talks more than teaches. For his review day before the final he goes over what we need to learn in terms of CONCEPTS. Doesn't actually go over an problem. If you ask to go over a specific problem, he will only set it up for you not teach those who don't know how to follow through."
7566,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH266,1.0,5.0,"Worst professor. He lectures every single page of the textbook but instead of making it easier to understand, he puts the words into broader terms and uses advanced math symbols to explain the concepts. He doesnt understand teaching and gives no chance of recovery if you start out the class on the wrong foot. He expects answers how he taught."
7567,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH173,1.0,5.0,"He will give you a summary of each chapter and rush through a few examples without explaining rules and the process of how to solve the problem. You are expected to know every formula although you could write it down in your notes and use it on the open note quiz, he won't let you practice in class. His lectures are interesting but you won't learn."
7568,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH174,1.0,5.0,worst professor of all time!
7569,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH265,1.0,4.0,"On the first day of class, he warned us all about how hard the course would be for a good 30 minutes. This is demonstrative of his overall behavior as an instructor of not only setting students up to fail his class, but encouraging their failure.I am baffled by Bredeck's disinterest in considering the position of his students in his class."
7570,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH264,1.0,5.0,Terrible teacher and puts student down. He literally gives us lectures daily on how we won't be successful and should quit our stem majors.
7571,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,1.0,4.0,He's an alright guy but more often than not I found that he didn't understand the assignments he was giving out and I was left to figure it out on my own. Don't take unless you have a good group of people that you know will come to class (attendance isn't mandatory loll)
7572,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,1.0,3.0,"Doesnt give clear rubrics, doesnt go over topics, doesnt give clear standards of what he expects. He expects students to do topics and homework without showing how to do problems"
7573,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH265,1.0,5.0,In his lectures he rushes through everything too fast and you don't get a chance to write everything down in your notes. He doesn't teach calculus sections in the correct order and jumps around randomly ahead to sections or topics we haven't learned about and doesn't seem to be very empathetic towards the class's understanding of the math they know
7574,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,1.0,5.0,"DO. NOT. TAKE. HIM! WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT NOVA. HE NEVER TEACHES YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR THE QUIZZES AND TESTS. NEVER ANSWERS QUESTIONS AND SAYS ""ASK YOUR GROUP"" WHEN NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. ALSO, CLASS NEVER CORRELATES WITH HOMEWORK AND EXCELS THAT ARE DUE, SEEMED LIKE I WAS TAKING TWO DIFFERENT MATH CLASSES."
7575,908202,Martin,Bredeck,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTT4,1.0,4.0,"Sorry not sorry, but there wasn't a time where I actually got help in my class. I was always told every class that I was behind, and I guess Mr Bredeck didn't understand that some students have rough and tiring lives outside of class. He just tells you to go look in the textbook and doesn't actually help you. I would not recommend him to anyone."
7577,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,3.0,"It is an easy class, there is not a lot of homework, but if you pay attention you will learn a lot of economic topics."
7578,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,4.0,4.0,Hard 8-wk but manageable compared to other online 8-wks
7579,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,4.0,4.0,"I like the class lectures but the course is very demanding. As others said, he makes you work hard for your grade. But, I am also learning alot for the first time at the school. Don't miss any lectures. They are important."
7580,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,3.0,4.0,"class is mandatory in order to pass. he has a group project so if you're not social, buckle up."
7581,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,3.0,4.0,"He uses his own real life experiences as examples so it's funny and a little easier to remember but the class is hard in general so be sure to do LOTS of reading, even if he doesn't assign it. You're basically teaching yourself, he's just there to give you a brief summary on the main topics."
7582,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,5.0,2.0,He is a great teacher and very helpful. Just keep up with your work and will be alright
7583,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,5.0,Makes economics easy to understand will take him again.
7584,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,5.0,2.0,I took ECO 202 online over the summer. Do the practice quizzes for each chapter before each test multiple times and you will get an A. Textbook is really helpful and you won't pass without reading it. Mindtap homework is a little time consuming so don't wait till the last minute. The class is easy but you have to put some work into it!
7585,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,3.0,"Professor Min explains Economics in a really good way and makes it interesting; however, you need to attend all his classes and listen to his lecture because they are the only thing that will help for the tests which are kinda complicated"
7586,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,4.0,Attending lectures and taking good notes. Great teacher.
7587,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,2.0,"Took his 8 week online course. Weekly homework, take-home final, one group report, 2-3 discussion boards on Blackboard, and 2 exams at the testing center (the quizzes he has on Blackboard are literally the questions on the exams; just make sure you take each chapter quiz on Blackboard more than once b/c it has different questions each time!)."
7588,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,3.0,"I took his hybrid class (50% online/50% in class) so it was very fast paced; However, Professor Min made each lecture count. He uses his own lectures (much better than the book) so book is not really necessary. Two fairly exams (one take home) and a few questions due every 3-4 chapters. Highly recommend his class. Great teacher!"
7589,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,4.0,4.0,"professor Min is really an interesting professor and he makes economics so easy and understandable. however, the tests are heavy and he takes points off on few things. other than that, I learned a lot from him."
7590,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,3.0,"TAKE JOHN MIN! His lectures will keep you focused and entertained until the end of class. I recommend him highly!! He teaches you a lot on real life situations. Optional of working with a group or alone. He stopped taking attendance after the third class. Very chill. But do your work if you want a good grade, and he accepts late assignments!"
7591,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,5.0,4.0,"Economic is not an easy subject, but professor John Min makes it really easy. He uses everyday life subjects to make an example of what he teaches or even he uses his life ( himself, his family) to create interesting stories. Thus, he makes Economic more down-to-earth and more engaging. He is the one makes me want to major in economics."
7592,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,4.0,I dropped another class to attend Dr. Min's class. His class is fun and engaging.
7593,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,4.0,3.0,Great class!  It was fun and I actually learned a lot of eco.  Take Professor Min's class.
7594,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,5.0,4.0,"Just took Min's micro final.  It was hard and my grade may suffer. But, I learned a lot.  His lectures are great and funny.  His exam is challenging but fair.  Plan to take his macro in the spring."
7595,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,4.0,3.0,"A good professor. He is responsive, very knowledgeable and funny. Although he doesn't take an attendance, most of questions in the test are from what he talks in class. You're gonna be required to form a study group at the beginning of the course."
7596,254496,John,Min,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,201ECO,5.0,4.0,OK. He is very good.  But I had to work much more than I expected.  I did learn alot about how the economy works.  I  recommend taking  Min.
7598,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101SPA102,5.0,4.0,"Professor S.E. is THE best professor I've ever had-- for language and overall. Although she is tough on her students, you can tell she really cares about you and your progression in the class. Very passionate and incredibly knowledgeable (and I think she's super fun). Show up to lecture, do homework, ask questions and the class will be a breeze!"
7599,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA102,1.0,5.0,Honestly I shouldve looked at these reviews before I signed up for the class. It was awful. Only saving graces is I got the C needed to transfer it in when I leave NOVA and she got nicer when the course was ending. I sure teaching a language is hard online but show some compassion and dont just rely on VHL to teach us. We want to learn!
7600,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA102,1.0,5.0,"- Expects you to already know how to speak the language even in a 100 level class - Cocky, talks down to students because we arent on the same level as her and calls it tough love - Doesnt have schedule for when exams are, just emails you the week of - Snappy and rude in email response - Week of first exam she assigned 8 hours of HW"
7601,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sparks- Early is one of the best professors I have ever learned from. If you are the type of student who doesn't like to have honest feedback, then she isn't for you. She is very honest. But her being honest, helps you to be better. The tests are not easy and yes, there is a lot of homework. But it's worth it! You should take her."
7602,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,2.0,4.0,"Really wanted to enjoy her class, but it seems as though she has her favorites even in an online class format. Not all teachers teach the same, and it is like she is oblivious to that. She thinks that her way of teaching is the only way. It is very hard to learn a foreign language when the teacher expects you to be a native speaker."
7603,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA201,1.0,5.0,"She was about as subjective as you could get. If she liked you, you did well. If not, shes giving you a D so you cant transfer the credit to a real university. She thinks she is super incredible, but has only taught at a community college for the last 20 years. Take the other professors if you can, she is not a good professor at all."
7604,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA202,5.0,5.0,"Professor Sparks-Early is a tough, but extremely awesome teacher. She will take time out of her day to actively help you. She wont hold your hand through the class, shell still make you work just as hard as everyone else, but shell help you EARN a good grade. As long as you show that you care and put effort into your work, you will pass."
7605,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,1.0,5.0,"she is a tough grader and her expectations are that you arrive with some Spanish knowledge. A lot of work, essays and tests. Over the top hard for a Spanish 101 course."
7606,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA202,5.0,3.0,"I took her for 1 online class and 2 in-person classes. She is very passionate about the subject and makes it fun to learn. You must put in the effort, do the assignments, &amp; you'll do well. She is very helpful and will work with students. Mostly online textbook work, typed journals, and extra handouts for practice. Tests are similar to homework."
7607,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Sparks-Early is a no BS type of teacher. She is very straight forward with her expectations and if you can't meet them then you won't do well. There is a lot of HW and quite a few exams but show up to class, pay attention, and try, that's all it takes. She seems mean and blunt which she sometimes is but that stern-ness helped me get an A."
7608,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,4.0,4.0,"I am currently taking her class and she is very helpful. In my opinion, as long as you do the work and study, you will be okay. She goes over mostly everything in class and does give a lot of homework, but it did help me when it came to tests and other assignments. I would take her again."
7609,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,4.0,4.0,Ive taken 2 languages before this Spanish class and never before have I had a teacher who knows the correct way to teach the material in a way that makes it so easy to learn.
7610,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,1.0,5.0,"Lots of harsh criticism although it was only a 101 course for new spanish speakers. She is very rude and a harsh grader. Be careful as there is a lot of homework, expensive text books and lots of exams as well."
7611,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,1.0,5.0,"Very hard to feel comfortable when she is rude and doesnt tolerate accents. Lots of homework, expensive text book and unfair grading. Be careful."
7612,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA102,5.0,3.0,"My 2nd semester w/ Profe SE. I find her classes highly engaging. She finds unique ways to involve the class in speaking &amp; learning. I have had poor instructors in the past for another language &amp; realize how good she is. If you are a mature, motivated student that understand that there will be homework &amp; assignments. Take this professor please"
7613,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA102,1.0,5.0,"Your excitement to learn Spanish will be hurt badly. Shes very strict, expects you to be fluent and is so rude. 0/10."
7614,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA102,1.0,5.0,"Just dont take her. Your self-esteem, enjoyment of foreign language, and grade will PLUMMET."
7615,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA202,1.0,3.0,"I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to take her class. If anything she shouldn't be teaching at any college with the way she acts and treats her students. Yelling at your students because we don't pick up the language as easily as you do. Don't even teach. Just here, look at it, copy it down, done."
7616,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,1.0,5.0,"She just lectures all class, no questions are allowed and she expects students to be fluent in Spanish. Has her own grading system that goes against the university and shes a very hard grader. Many assignments that will leave you overwhelmed. Be careful please."
7617,688253,Cristina,Sparks-Early,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Languages,SPA101,1.0,5.0,"She does not communicate well. I was overwhelmed with her assignments, quizzes, papers, exams and projects. She is very rude to students as well. She has her own grading system that makes it very hard to get a good grade. It was Spanish 101 but we were all treated as if we were supposed to be fluent Spanish speakers. Never again."
7619,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,5.0,2.0,"I have never been a fan of history but this has been my favorite class. work load is easy and lectures are fascinating. Some readings, some videos, gives complete study guide for midterm and final. Highly recommend, esp if you think history is hard or boring."
7620,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"If you want a professor that actually wants her students to succeed and actually enjoys teaching History, you can't go wrong with Professor Salhi. If you don't show up to class, take no notes, don't do any homework or extra credit then yeah, you probably won't pass. But if you put in some effort, that A is there Note: Do the HW it helps on tests"
7621,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS111,1.0,1.0,She is the worse professor I ever had!
7622,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Salhis his 101 course was super easy, most of the work consisted of textbook questions and readings, which you go over in class, that prepare you for the actual tests (open note) as long as you show up to the lectures and do the readings youll pass. she loves students who engage in the discussions so dont be afraid!"
7623,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Dr Ruma Salhi was an amazing professor. Her lectures are really good and valuable that help you to understand more about history and relating to modern era. In order to get A, we should take the class seriously and spend more time for the class and writing. You will get A if you do all your best."
7624,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Prof Salhi is a real gem! Very understanding of technical/computer issues and work/life balance. Does want high quality work. Not too bad on assignments, but have to show effort. Great lecture. Very passionate about history."
7625,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,5.0,Please dont take this teacher if you really wanna pass the class and at least get a good grade. Shes really bad at explaining things. I believe she needs more practice with her knowledge about History. She expects too much from a student without knowing that its only 6 week class. I asked her for help with the textbook and she made fun of me.
7626,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS111,5.0,2.0,"I just finished a remote hybrid 6 week class with dr. Salhi and it was truly wonderful. Very organized. Zoom lectures were fascinating. There were some videos, some readings, short essays, the usual. Very reasonable prof and I learned a lot."
7627,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,5.0,3.0,"I have had dr. Salhi in person and on lone for switch to remote. She is all around fantastic. Yes, u will have to work but it is not that bad and she is super nice and caring. Lots of ec to help. Great lectures and videos. Remote might even be easier. Recommend!"
7628,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,1.0,4.0,"Honestly liked her class until we switched to remote instructions, her tests were so easy but she started giving out so many assignments and they are not even helpful. The new tests are super long and time consuming and are worth a few points which sucks. Save your money please, her online classes are horrible."
7629,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,Dr. Salhi is an amazing professor. Her tests are open note so you have to take really good notes. She has lots of extra credit to give out. She does give two term papers but they are not difficult. Do the homework because you're allowed to use them on the tests too.
7630,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,4.0,If you're looking for an easy A DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! You HAVE to use the textbook and read the material thoroughly to understand the class. Not all of the information is on the textbook so you have to show up to class to write notes. SHE DOES NOT ALLOW PHONES OR LAPTOPS TO BE USED IN CLASS. The tests are open note but ARE ESSAY HEAVY AND LONG.
7631,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,Really wish we could have finished the semester in person w/ dr salhi. I learned so much about history in her lectures and even the homwork readings were easy and fascinating. i hope to go back in the fall
7632,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,001N,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Salhi's class was awesome. It's a pretty normal paced class as a 16 week HIS 111 course, you NEED to do the homework and read but she gives extra credit in a form of going to a museum and writing a two page paper. The content was cool, fair, and work was good. Nice teacher!"
7633,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,4.0,3.0,"shes not a tough grader, but she wants you to put in all your effort for the assignments, &amp; participate! her exams are not hard, although the T/F can be tricky so take good notes!! it also consists of essays and map(s) portion (you can use tracing papers) other than that, shes an amazing prof and you wont regret taking her class"
7634,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,5.0,3.0,"This is my second time taking Dr. Salhi, loved taking her both times. She really knows your history and makes you engaged even if you dislike history overall! Her assignments are straight forward and if you complete in a reasonable time you'll do fine. Open note tests!"
7635,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Salhi is great!!! Class is easy and fair if you do the work. Tests are challenging and there r 2 term papers that are ok, but their is extra credit to help you. She's very nice and caring and great lectures."
7636,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS111,2.0,4.0,1) the majority of the things on the study guide are gonna have to be self taught 2) the work load is ridiculous. 3) The questions are very difficult to understand; you have to deeply think about certain topics. 4) she's unbelievably passive aggressive and rude for no reason. 5) she talks too fast so good luck taking notes on important things.
7637,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,3.0,"Not sure why her ratings are a little low, Dr. Salhi is an amazing professor, she truly loves history and cares for her students. Test are open note, a little tricky but if you take good notes you should do good. She offers unlimited extra credit. Her lectures are extremely engaging and interesting. She really makes you think. Take her!!!!"
7638,1555978,Ruma,Salhi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I have ever taken and believe will ever have. Study guides are given and tests are open note, so if you study all of the material on the study guide and write it down in your book then you will do great. Unlimited extra credit as well, defiantly take advantage of that as much as possible. go to class and you'll do fine. LOVED HER"
7640,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,3.0,"best online class I've taken during the pandemic. if you've taken calc before would recommend. if it's your first time homework is a must. Professor is super nice, really good at expanding/explaining calc ideas. Need help? go to his office hours he's great at explaining things. Due to covid there's only 1 exam that determines if you pass or fail."
7641,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,2.0,3.0,"says he'll give a quiz every week instead of 4 big tests, but im nearing the end of my 15 week course and we have had 4 quizzes. if we mess up on the final we're pretty much screwed"
7642,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,3.0,3.0,"The class is ok, I was intimidated at first, but he makes sure you learn the concepts"
7643,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,3.0,"I'm grateful I took my first math class at NOVA with Professor Victorine. He really wants the students to learn and honestly, he doesn't really care about if you get all the homework done. He wants you to get the concept down. He grades a little slow, but in Zoom meetings, he likes to engage with the students about life and other topics."
7644,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,2.0,4.0,"he's honestly a nice human but as far as teaching the subject and how difficult it is to contact him, its not very positive on that side. He tries to be relatable and hes a very fun going person at times but explanations and help with the ALEKS system is lackluster."
7645,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,4.0,"Professor Victorine is GREAT. First 30 minutes of lecture is for questions. His exams are really tough, but if you practice enough you should be good. His grading is very fair. This isn't an easy class, not easy A. Only easy if you put the effort and practice a lot. Usually 3 exams, final replaces lowest grade. If you love Math take him,he does too"
7646,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH173,1.0,5.0,"Difficult, petty, rude, and definitely not a good (even an OK) teacher. Takes things personally, doesn't care if you aren't understanding. Petty like no teacher I have ever taken. And I wish would act his profession. Don't like teachers who think students are stupid. Students are just that students to learn, we don't know much hence the questions."
7647,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,"This is by far the worst math teacher I have ever had. When we moved to remote learning, he didn't talk or respond to us for a month! He posted one math video before turning us to a math teacher on youtube. Finals are next week and he has not graded the midterms. There is only a midterm and a final and both are about 10 questions. He doesn't teach"
7648,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,1.0,4.0,DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I'm taking his class during the global pandemic. the class became online and for almost a month he didn't teach us anything. he uploaded only one 20 min video. we are on week 14 and I don't know how I'm doing in the class because he didn't return any grades. Worst professor I've ever taken at NOVA.
7649,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH261,1.0,4.0,"Look I was debating giving Prof. V a good score in the beginning of the semester, but since the COVID-19 switch for NOVA he has essentially abandoned our class. Our tests from beginning of March have not been graded and we only have 3 exams. He has only contacted us once since the switch with one lecture video, no plan, nothing."
7650,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH261,1.0,4.0,"After NOVA switched to online learning due to COVID-19, Prof. Victorine has failed to give us any work. He promised us through email that he would give us homework, but has not. He also not graded our midterms. He has abandoned our class."
7651,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH167,1.0,4.0,"Victorine cancelled classes on us frequently(even the first week) and was unprepared when Covid19 closed down campuses after spring break while my other professors easily went to zoom. 2 weeks after break and he has yet to have an online lecture, post content, or even grade our first exams. Our learning software ALEKS felt like my real professor"
7652,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,4.0,4.0,I was very relieved with the first 3/4 of this class. I took a 8 week online course and I was able to get the work done on schedule. I struggled with the last exam units and had to use NOVA's tutor's a few times. He did not respond to my messages but keep up with the assignments and use the online tutors if needed and you should do well.
7653,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,2.0,3.0,"He only has the final and the midterm with no opportunities for extra credit opportunities. He doesn't give breaks in his lectures which are almost 3 hours long, and he doesn't explain his material well expecting everyone to already know anything."
7654,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2,4.0,3.0,"Michael Victorine is an overall decent professor. Hes incredibly good at math, and can answer pretty much any question you throw at him with relative ease and clear demonstration. He genuinely seems like he enjoys teaching. Calculus is still a tough subject, so dont expect an easy A. Tests count for all of your grade, so make sure to study."
7655,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH271,2.0,5.0,"He just writes on the board at 80 mph as if he's talking to a room of mathematicians. Makes things way too complicated, I feel like half the Calc 1 class so far has been ""Check this out, you'll learn this in Calc 5"" or ""This is so hard I would never put this on my tests."" Then the class ends 1 hour early. Like dude I need to learn Calc 1."
7656,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALCU173,5.0,4.0,"One of my favorite classes ever and I dont particularly like math. Victorine is great, not only because he is knowledgeable, but because of his no-nonsense attitude and humor. You have to put in work in order to do well in this course. If you do the hw, go to lecture, and participate, this class is great. Very fair grader. Loves questions."
7657,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,5.0,4.0,Math is a hard topic already. I see some people blame their failures on professors.I took this course after being 10 years away from school. I studied A LOT! if you do your part Professor Victorine is really willing to help you. You can ask questions at the begining of every single class. some classes he spent the whole time on answering questions!
7658,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,CALC2,1.0,5.0,"If you taking this class, the good new is that you don't have homework and you don't need to go to class every time , because he doesn't care if you come or not. The bad new is that you need to teach yourself to learn every things for this class."
7659,861752,Michael,Victorine,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH163,1.0,5.0,"This professor gives only midterm and final, so if u fail those u are done. Don't take him, he repeated a few times in class: ""They pay me here to solve puzzles (integrals), I don't care if you guys fail"". He is just overall a bad person, he knows math pretty well but is terrible at explaining it. For hw, he just said do them all."
7661,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH267,3.0,4.0,"Dr Haile was a nice professor, who truly wants his students to succeed. Here are the things you need to know if you take his diffy-q class: - 2 exams and a final and thats it - No curve , no extra credit . -Exam problems extremely similar to HW problems, no surprises - He tells you exactly what will be on the exam -HW not graded but needed"
7662,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH174,5.0,2.0,"Great dude, just show up to class."
7663,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,5.0,4.0,"Prof Haile is incredibly smart! He really knows his stuff and how to explain things. He has a very minor accent, but I could understand him well enough. He stays after class for any questions and will work with you to make sure you know it. It's a tough class, but he's the best professor to teach it."
7664,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH265,1.0,4.0,Only two tests worth 50% each for the six week online class. The entirety of the class was only 110 points and the average final grade for the class was around a 74.
7665,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH265,1.0,4.0,He gave us two tests worth 50% of our grade each. There were no other assignments worth credit.
7666,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,4.0,3.0,Good teacher you work for the grade that you want if you study hard and put in the effort you will pass the class he responds to emails and is overall plain guy doesnt do too much in the lectures just teaches you what you need to know
7667,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,4.0,4.0,"He let me ask many questions. The quizzes sometimes included things that he didn't go over well in class, but usually we were prepared for them. Final exam was only tough because he didn't tell us exactly what would be on it. I'm bad at math, so I had to work very hard, but if you put in effort he will help you understand. No study guides."
7668,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,2.0,4.0,"Says to ask questions if you don't understand, but is extremely confrontational and short-tempered when you do. Had a quiz worth 15% of grade after 3 classes. An ok professor to take the course with if you already knew all the material, but wouldn't recommend unless you have already taken it before. Takes off a lot of points for small mistakes."
7669,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,2.0,4.0,he would give problems that even he didn't know the answer to. he over-complicates everything
7670,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH265,1.0,5.0,"Take him if you wanna fail the class. Horrible attitude when you ask questions and especially he doesn't like you. HW is not graded, all based on test and he is a tough grader."
7671,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH267,3.0,4.0,"He didn't make HW mandatory for us, but if you don't do it you'll pretty much fail. Exams were tricky and they didn't have a lot of points to them so it was easy to get a bad grade. If you take him, get ready to know ""EXACTLY WHERE THESE EQUATIONS COME FROM""."
7672,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH267,3.0,4.0,"I took DE over the summer with him where we were only graded by 3 exams. He's a pretty good teacher when it comes to explaining. Although often he has a bad attitude and even though he tells us to ask questions, he gets visibly annoyed when you ask times. He's intimidating I guess."
7673,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH267,4.0,3.0,"Good Prof for Diff EQ, its a hard class though. He gives a lot of extra credit if you ask for it in class and participate. The material in this class is IMPOSSIBLE though, I had a C for the most part and picked it up by the end somehow. I have a problem with the textbook though, I didn't really use it for any other than Homework, doing HW is key."
7674,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH277,2.0,5.0,"goes by too fast and homework is not graded so you dont get motivated to do it. do not take it with him, he failed me and now i have to take it again, do not take chances taking his class. now my graduation needs to be postponed thanks to him :)"
7675,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH167,3.0,4.0,"if he didnt use my Math lab, then I'm sure everybody would pass his class. His lectures are heavy and for the exams, he asks for the single most basic stuff that u wouldn't even think of. he likes to favor certain people and can be mean at times. ""HE'S ALWAYS RIGHT"" no matter what. no calculators allowed!! syllabus not clear."
7676,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,5.0,4.0,"Professor Haile is supportive of his students and encourages questions. Explains material thoroughly but he goes pretty fast. Clear grading criteria and tests are very similar to homework. He's open to feedback from students such as adding a bonus question to the final. Overall, he is a great instructor."
7677,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,4.0,4.0,Not mean but is intimidating. Gets irritated when asked questions but often reminds us to ask if needed. Board work fast and unclear. Book unclear as well. Had to use other sources to learn. Hw not graded. Does not give trick/surprise exam Qs. They are often from book or class. May give bonus Qs. Comforting knowing exams will be reasonable.
7678,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,2.0,3.0,"The material of the class is not difficult, but the teaching method plays a large role in understanding the class. Prof. Haile writes the notes by hand and goes super fast. He expects you to understand right away and seems to get frustrated and one asks questions. He tends to be serious almost all the time so approaching him is intimidating."
7679,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH166,5.0,4.0,"One of the best math professors I've ever had. Explains the subject very well and goes through how to get to the formulas and not just ""remember"" them. If you read the textbook, go to class and take good notes, and do all the homework on my math lab, you will do good. Tests are never more than 20 questions. One thing to remember is to ask questions"
7680,1581131,David,Haile,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH273,5.0,3.0,"He is the best even though he is a tough grader. The exams are similar to the homework so even he will not check your homework, you should better to do it."
7682,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIST122,5.0,4.0,"Love the stories he tells and good mix of readings, films and notes you need to take. Exams are much of the grade plus the paper which is in four parts. Very helpful and he knows his stuff he told us about his book, interesting. Great and will take again, recommend! Read, pay attention, watch the films and you will do great."
7683,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, really cares, mix of lectures, notes, films... he is very helpful and will take again!"
7684,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,"Zoom class with lectures and with zoom more films, read the book watch the films and ask questions, good combination of information and he is very helpful, also very caring, do the work and you will do well, highly recommend, great professor!"
7685,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,4.0,3.0,"Professor Schmitz is very nice, but he assigns too many papers. He gives good feedback and is willing to put in the extra time to work with students if they need it. I do not recommend this class to anyone who does not like to write."
7686,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,"Where to begin. From sitting in lectures hearing him talk and talk and talk. To the paper assignments worse than my AP classes, this professor was the most unhelpful one I have ever taken."
7687,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIST122,5.0,4.0,Great class with mix of lectures and discussions of online text and films; good pace and Prof. Schmitz responds quickly to emails and helps you a lot. Lots of online resources to help with paper and exams which you can use your notes and films and online resources... do the work and you will do fine. Recommend and will take him again!
7688,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,4.0,"Prof. Schmitz has wonderful lectures. I learned so much from this short 6 week session. I willl take him again in the fall to get even more information, he stays after the online class end for questions and answers, and that really helped me succeed. Definitely recommend him!"
7689,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,"Just finished taking Prof. Schmitz's 6 week summer class. All the work is outlined in the syllabus, so you can study ahead. There are two exams, along with a five-page paper. He responds to e-mail in a timely manner, and stays after class if you have questions. Great teacher, recommend taking his class!"
7690,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Enjoyed the class, lots of work but it is college. The canvas site has lots of resources so use them, book and films and lots of help for the exams and paper. A lot of writing but you have the whole semester to do work as you go. Do the work and get help and you learn a lot. Definitely recommend and will take Prof. Schmitz again, cares a lot."
7691,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,4.0,4.0,"it was an okay class. i did an online 6 week summer class. attendance is a grade so make sure you attend all zoom meetings. grades are based off of a research paper (including topic, outline, &amp; rough draft), midterm exam, final exam, and attendance. make sure you do all of the readings and watch the films. also take lots of notes during class."
7692,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,4.0,"Prof Schmitz is an amazing teacher. He is kind and cares about his students. His lectures are great. My only regret is taking HIS121 in 6weeks. Its A LOT of info and 6weeks is not enough time to fully grasp key concepts. There are 2 exams, one 5pg paper and questions on each of the chapters. Yes its a lot of work, a lot of reading, but worth it!"
7693,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIST122,5.0,4.0,"Great class, take notes, work everyday. Everything is on canvas, films, notes, and lectures too. Will take again. Recommend"
7694,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Schmitz knows his stuff, take him. CLasses are a mix of lectures, and take notes you can use, films and online resources. . He will help you so just ask and will take him again. You don't memorize you learn concepts and ideas and writing for the exams and the paper. Prepares you for after nova. Definitely recommend if you want to learn."
7695,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,4.0,"I liked prof. Schmitz classes, interesting and a mix of lectures, films, and canvas; everything is online and while lots of reading and writing you know the exams and he will help you. definitely recommend and am taking another class with him. He is a tough but fair grader and he looks for improvement and helps you, recommend!"
7696,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,"Lectures were off videos and it was hard to take notes, he really didnt grade well. Hard to explain and the class was just boring."
7697,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,3.0,"Professor Schmitz loves teaching and you can tell. He cares about students and gives fast feedback for assignments. I missed the lectures after we went online. Talk to him and he will help you, it is a lot of work, but pace yourself and use the resources and films. Love the class and will take him again. Highly recommend!"
7698,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,4.0,He is a good professor. The exams he gave us were A LOT of work so make sure you dont leave things last minute (approx. 12 pages of answering different questions from the films he makes us watch) The paper he makes us write throughout class was a PAIN. DONT BUY THE 5TH EDITION textbook. I have no idea why he even had that as an option.
7699,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,4.0,4.0,"This class was not easy. There was not enough time in the week to watch/take notes on the documentary/instructional films that he assigned. The take-home essays/exams take a LOT of time/effort. But he really cares about students and if you put in your full effort, he will do everything he can to help you succeed. He expects a lot, but he is kind"
7700,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,3.0,"I took his course online! he is very easy to talk to. He is a fair grader and will tell you his honest opinion . He is good at responding to emails! If you have a question, he is always happy to answer!"
7701,1472825,John,Schmitz,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,1.0,"Professor Schmitz is an awesome and inspirational teacher, very caring, he gives good feedback, and is very helpful. He gives great lessons in class, and the material and books you get for his class are really informative and educational and will help you in class. Overall, I highly recommend you take him for History 121."
7703,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,4.0,3.0,"He really cares about his students. There were a lot of tests (like 10) and those made up your grade. You can retake the tests 3 times, each a different version of the same material. He is super passionate about his students passing and learning. He has really flexible office hours, so if you are struggling, then he'll be there for you. THE BEST!!"
7704,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH161,4.0,3.0,Best professor take him!!!! You wont regret it.
7705,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,5.0,4.0,He can be a tough grader sometimes but he cares and his grading is very clear. Take him!
7706,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,5.0,4.0,"8wk! He is very clear with his grading, he cares and wants students to pass. There are 7 excel projects, 4 tests, midterm, final, and 30 mymathlab assignments. MML hw can be very time consuming but you have until the end to submit it. Whats great about his grading is that he multiplies your final grade by 1.1 :) as long as you try you should pass!"
7707,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH261,2.0,5.0,"To start, Scalea is a very nice guy, but an extremely tough and unfair grader. Though he does allow retakes, I would not recommend this teacher. The retakes are harder, and he penalizes you as well as nit picks every little thing. I got points taken off for putting 3, instead of (3,0) etc, or accidentally not putting ""Y "" 3. Also there are 6 exams"
7708,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Scalea is a great math professor as he does his best in lectures to present the material so that students will understand. His class has many assignments from in-class worksheets, to excel projects, to homework assignments. However, he does give students second chances on most assignments and has a very clear grading criteria."
7709,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,3.0,4.0,"Prof Scalea is a really great guy, he cares for his students, and wants them to succeed. I wasn't a huge fan of his teaching style though and felt that he went through the material pretty fast, but also keep in mind that it's a heavy class (5c). ALEKS is SUPER IMPORTANT, so don't slack on the homework. This class requires a lot of work, be prepared"
7710,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH154,5.0,3.0,"Scalea is the best math teacher at NOVA. A lot of ppl struggle with math &amp; he really tries to help everyone succeed. There's a lot of work (projects, MyLab, 4 tests, midterm &amp; final), but he gives you practice tests beforehand that almost match the tests (the #s are different though). Sign up early because his classes fill quickly. He's a real gem!"
7711,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,1.0,5.0,"So I was under the impression that he was going to be somewhat easy. Wrong! I had the hardest time figuring out his excel project and what the instructions were for those projects. So much homework between MyMathLab, Excel projects, and studying for tests. One positive thing is he does give you a review test before each test. Choose wisely."
7712,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,5.0,4.0,"He is a very traditional teacher; however, he is also very diplomatic and very understanding. Mr. Scalea is kind and funny, he admits his flaws and mistakes, which is more than I can say about most of the teachers I had in High School. You can tell he cares about each and everyone of his students."
7713,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,3.0,4.0,He is a nice guy but honestly cant teach. Calc solely depends on your professor and I do not recommend him. Ive never done bad in math and hes overall not good at narrowing stuff down. Basically my whole class was struggling. 6 test that were basically every week and one final. Retakes are allowed but harder. He also never even posted the syllabus
7714,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,5.0,3.0,"Scalea doesn't really know how to explain math concepts, but he's super helpful outside of class. I got an A in his class with an average high C test grades, but thats bc he gives out 5 pts for just showing up to class (total 100 pts). There are test retakes! Really great guy overall!!!"
7715,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH161,1.0,4.0,Prof Scalea is a nice guy but I found his lectures pretty difficult to understand. He doesn't use canvas and his teaching style is pretty old school. When in a lecture he will say what he is writing but doesn't explain/teach the material very well. Would not take this class again.
7716,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,3.0,"He is easy going professor but you have to work hard in calculus. His tests are heavy; however, if you do the problems set and pay attention, so you will be fine in the exams. Also, you can re-take the test 3 times but each time the score will reduction 5 points."
7717,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,5.0,3.0,"He is easily one of the best professors at NOVA. If you show up, pay attention, and put in effort you should pass with an A or a B. He allows re-takes and extra help outside of class. He just wants his students to be successful. I ASSURE YOU IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO PASS IS CLASS."
7718,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,3.0,4.0,"His way to teaching is old school and wasn't for me. But I think he knows the subject really well. For me, he doesn't explain it well and I couldn't understand his lectures. I have to read the book in order to better understand it. He's a good professor, but he just wasn't in tune with the way I study."
7719,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,5.0,2.0,"You get to retake every quiz 3 times, and the midterm twice. No retakes on the final. but these 3 things will make up 90% of your grade. He isn't very good at teaching the concepts but he will make it impossible for you to not get atleast a B. As class goes on he will make to get more lenient as he gets to know you more. Easy A"
7720,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH154,5.0,1.0,"If you SHOW up and take initiative to retake his tests I GUARANTEE you will get atleast a B. I literally graduated from high school without taking algebra 2, and I got an A. THIS MAN MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO FAIL. His retakes are if not exactly, very similar to the original test, and he gives a study guide before-hand."
7721,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,4.0,3.0,"If you aren't good at math, I suggest you take a different professor. Scalea isn't the best at explaining how to solve problems. I would only retake Scalea for another easy math classe, not for more advance classes. If you already have a basic understanding for math, take him. Allows test retakes/ gives exam reviews almost identical to actual exam."
7722,856430,John,Scalea,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,3.0,"He's a really great guy and a great teacher if you put in the effort/actually pay attention. I was not the greatest at math in high school, but I payed attention and ended up with an A in the class. Calculus is a hard subject, but if you do all the problem sets and study those, you'll be fine on the tests. He also gives good extra credit"
7724,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,A101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Lash is easily my favorite professor I've ever had! She knows the material and makes it relatable. She's very fun, sweet, and offers help in her class and beyond. Her lectures are PowerPoints that stem from the textbook plus her expert knowledge, but you are only tested on EASY textbook material. Easy homework, one opinionated paper."
7725,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,3.0,The best human being out there and the best Professor!

7727,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,A101,5.0,5.0,sweetest super talkative teacher she is so caring and the class was easy because attendance wasn't required. All the online assignments were quizlitable.
7728,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,"Best professor I have ever had hands down. 15 homeworks all online (due before FINALS WEEK), 3 tests (25 identify questions in class and 25 you fill out at home), 1 final (ONLINE gave us all day to finish), 2 papers (VERY easy grader). She is the only professor I've had that actually enjoys the subject and it shows in lecture. Guaranteed A."
7729,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,"She was super easy going, laid back, and made me really appreciate art and want to travel to see everything she talked about. Easy A. Take home test."
7730,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Lash was honestly one of the best professors ive ever had. We only had one paper and two exams, the final exam was take home! Show up and you'll pass."
7731,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,2.0,She is one of the best professor I have ever had. Super easy class. One museum paper and two exams which are completely easy you will do half of the exam at home and the other half in class. I love her. She is super professor. I wish she can teach other class too. Take her without any hesitation. You won't regret it.
7732,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART10102,5.0,2.0,She is really good teacher and this is going to be one of the easiest class you can take at nova. 1 museum paper and test are easy too half of it you do it at home and other half in class. She is not a hard grader at all. I took her summer course as well. The hybrid quizzes are on canvas and you don't need the textbook all the answers are online.
7733,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART102,5.0,1.0,"She understands that students have enough on their plate already &amp; take art because it's a requirement. She wants students to focus on classes related to their major but, in the mean time she teaches and covers the content so well. Half of test questions are take home and final is online please take her for art! Easy A and a fun semester for sure!"
7734,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART102,5.0,1.0,"Took her 8wk hybrid class, easy A professor, but her lectures are very interesting. She sets up her exams to be half in class and half at home. She really tries to help everyone pass with an A. Even if you hate history, take her class and you won't regret it. One ""big"" museum visit/paper, 3 exams and 10 online quizzes."
7735,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,"I really recommend this professor!Took her for Art 101, biggest sweetheart. She wants this class to be the ""easy"" class for students so she is very straight up with how to succeed. Her class consists of 2/3 exams (Half of it is take home), 8 online open book quizzes due at the end of the semester, a museum paper and the final is take home too."
7736,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,A101,5.0,1.0,"Literally the BEST art history professor ever. She LOVES art, like ALOT. But I think that's the best part. literally all she wants is for you to enjoy it as much as her and if you do, and you will, its the easiest A ever. All quizzes are online half the test you take at home and the other half in class. Final is online as well. TAKE HER!!!"
7737,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,"Didn't think i would enjoy art class this much until i met professor Lash. Very easy going, missed an exam and she allowed me to make it up, just show up and you'll do fine."

I was nervous taking this class in the summer and didn't know what to expect and she really made it smooth and stress off. She told us not to worry but obviously u got to work as wells. 13 quizzes all online found in quizlet, easy museum project, 2 easy tests and take home final. I took her 5 week summer class and she's the best"
7739,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,Shes loves art history and will make you love it too! I want to travel more because of this class. I took the 5 week course which is 4hr class once week and maybe two hours at home studying. The textbook helps. I would take her again but she isn't teaching102 in the end of summer semester. Tests are easy. One paper just visit a Museum &amp; have proof
7740,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Lash is AMAZING! Her classes were great, even though it was a morning class. There was 3 test and a final, and for the test you can see it before taking it. Pay attention and you'll pass! She is super nice and sweet."
7741,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,Dr. Lash is the best professor that I have met so far at Nova. Her grading criteria are clear and it is obvious that you will get an A if you do your work. Her exams are 50 multiple choice questions and it is easy because 25 questions are take home and 25 at class. Take her and you will not regret taking this class.
7742,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,3.0,Take her class .!!!!
7743,633101,Barbara,Lash,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Fine Arts,ART101,5.0,1.0,"Wonderful lady, she understands why most people take art and it's not their majors so she tried to make the class as nonstressful as possible. It was a very enjoyable experience. I was taking 18 cr and this class was very easy. 3 exam, half of each exam are take home, one mask project (fun&amp; easy), easy museum paper. That's it."
7745,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,I am the worst person in History but this class was super easy. Professor Reagan teaches the material well and in an understandable way. There are no surprises she tells you exactly what she needs from you. There are 3 papers due and it's only about 3 pages and 3 exams. Super easy. Take her
7746,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,3.0,4.0,"I took HIS101 during the Spring 2020 semester. My overall grade was based on 10 quizzes, 4 papers, 3 exams and class participation. The 2 lowest quiz grades were dropped. Professor Reagan has a good sense of humor but unfortunately, it can come across the wrong way. I would recommend this class to someone who is willing to put in the work."
7747,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Took her HIS101 class Jan 2020 and progressed to online by March. Her powerpoints are her lectures with a few added comments, you have six papers due but only need to do four, weekly quizzes are about ten questions long and easy. You have two exams and a final, honestly its and easy A if you do your work and pay attention. Highly recommend her."
7748,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,1.0,She is such an easy professor!! her quizzes are based on the powerpoints and you only have 4 to do and they are 20 questions each and not timed. Her papers are super easy as well. She will proofread it and help you before you submit it and the midterm and final are basically the same. Super simple. If you want a good grade I would highly recommend.
7749,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,She is the BEST professor to take for any history class. She does not make anything difficult for her students. She makes you do four mini papers which is like one-two pages. All of her quizzes are online and multiple choice. She also gives out study guides that are exactly like the exams. Her lectures are amazing and easy to follow. Take her.
7750,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS122,4.0,1.0,"I took professor Reagan for the second part of U.S. History for 16 weeks. Overall, I got receive 8 quizzes online, 4 very easy papers, and like 3 exam (including final). She's lecture heavy and plays videos which can get really boing if you take her in the morning. You don't really need to read the textbook because lecture is enough if you listen."
7751,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,2.0,1.0,"Her class is insanely easy. On the other hand, she is extremely shady and arrogant. On our final day, she aggressively told a student who was late by a few minutes that she wishes he could've taken his exam online. She's not an interactive professor and rarely leaves her seat, so if you have ADD she is not useful. Simple questions aggravate her."
7752,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,1.0,"Hands-on the best History professor I have ever had. You don't need the textbook, she keeps some in the library for her students. You need it only for 4 of 6 papers. 95% is the max you'll get on her papers (only if she likes it). Easy tests. Study review sheet whose answers are in slides and you'll get an A. Amazing Professor!"
7753,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,1.0,"Best professor! if you aren't into history lectures boring but her exams are super easy they are essays and gives you the prompts to choose from so you could prepare before coming to class and actually writing it. Attendance doesn't really matter and their is a quiz every week its super easy control f on that powerpoint, 4 papers easy grading"
7754,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,5.0,2.0,She is the best professor at NOVA. She is caring and made class interesting!! She gives out reviews to help you study for the exams. She is always willing to you if you ever need help!! Take her!! 100% worth it.
7755,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,1.0,"If your looking for an easy A, that this professor! There are quizes after every lecture but the answers are in PP, six papers but you only have to do 4, and 2-3 exams. Exams are short answers, but she gives you the questons in advanced. If you're looking for a challenge, this might not be the profesor or you."
7756,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Wonderful professor! I'm not a big fan of history, but she made this class interesting so that I wouldn't get bored. The only time you need the book is for when you have to do your papers(which is just a one page paper, double spaced). All the quizzes are on blackboard. She gives you a review sheet for the tests, so it's really hard to fail."
7757,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,4.0,2.0,shes a pretty good profesor she just gives a lot of papers to write had to write 5 papers and a paper for each exam. every quiz is online and she doesnt grade attendance pretty solid teacher
7758,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS112,5.0,2.0,Good proffesor as long as you study her powerpoints the class should be fairly easy
7759,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,1.0,"There are 4 papers you need to do, but they're from the textbook (usually only time you would use the textbook). You have 6 out of 4 papers to do, i would recommend doing the first 4 so you're not doing them all last minute. Tests are super easy she gives a study guide showing you what will be on it. And there are quizzes done online every week."
7760,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Your grades are based on 4 small and easy papers based off the textbook and the tests which are extremely easy, she tells you what to study ahead of time and the study guide pretty much sets you up to get an A"
7761,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,1.0,Easy to pass her class. Very understanding.
7762,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,2.0,"Professor Reagan is definitely a character. This class was very easy-3 exams which all had study sheets provided and 4 extremely short papers. You only need the textbook for the paper prompts, so I recommend trying to find another student with the book instead of buying one. She also does not give 100s. All in all, I highly recommend!"
7763,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,5.0,1.0,"She was very nice and her lectures sometimes were cut short if she speeds through the slides. For the exams, she gave a study sheet of everything that would be on the test. It's just the matter of showing up turning in work and doing what she asked. All her work were easy."
7764,697425,Alice,Reagan,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101102,5.0,1.0,"She has to be the best professor at NOVA, hands down. Her explanations makes History a BREEZEEE. Take her at all costs. No cumulative exam. Only weekly quizzes. She gives you the study guide (which is the actual exam and asks you to prepare accordingly). Easiest A you can get in the history of your undergrad, that's for sure."
7766,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,5.0,"Shes incredibly annoying. Whenever you struggle in her class, she shares her life story and expects you to just get better because of it. You dont become a better writer because its basically a history/politics class. She expects an unnecessary amount of effort on every assignment. Dont be fooled by all the good reviews. Youve been warned."
7767,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,4.0,"She has no lesson plan ever. She makes everything up as she goes and talks about her life way to much. She is very biased and close minded and expects everyone to have the same opinions as her or else your grade will be affected. She will not teach you how to write, she will only show you how to fake it till you make it with her class. Terrible ..."

7769,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,4.0,"She talks about her personal life too much and history. She does not help very much with English itself. There is no test or textbooks, but effort counts and you can't be lazy in this class. She as well gives feedback to you, but she tells you in front of the whole class and it could get embarrassing. I wouldn't take this class again."
7770,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,4.0,"Professor Sexton makes things up while she goes. She gives you feedback in front of the whole class and makes you feel stupid. Talks way too much about her personal life. If one person misses an assignment she yells at the whole class. She doesn't even teach you how to be a good writer, its a history class."
7771,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENF2,1.0,3.0,I've taken Professor Sexton for ENF 2. She is a okay professor. She would take most about her personal life instead of giving wisdom and advice on being a better writer. She changes the syllabus without giving you an updated copy. Poor for simply wanting to ask a simple question. Take a professor who you like.
7772,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENF3,1.0,3.0,"Do not take her class. I'm angry with myself for not dropping it. She tells personal details of her life that have no business in a classroom setting that go into gruesome details. The class turns into a history class. You don't learn how to write college essays, but she will help you pass your history class because you work on mostly timelines."
7773,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111ENF3,5.0,3.0,"Take good notes and submit your homework online on time, subscribe to Netflix or a movie app like movies123 to complete some homework, buy a 2 binder and over 20 dividers, follow syllabus for portfolio review, final essay 7 pages plus work cited page.

7774,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,4.0,"You need to study to get a good grade. She is giving a lot of extra credit at the end. She wants all of her students to get an A. Portfolio, one final essay, one summary, and some timelines."

7777,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,2.0,4.0,I had her for my ENG111 and I struggled a lot. She grades the papers at the end of semester and makes you correct all the papers she graded. She makes you print your homework many times. I seriously learned nothing. Don't take her.
7778,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,1.0,Professor Sophia Sexton is one of the best professors at Nova. Dont hesitate to take her class. Youre are going to learn a lot things in her class. I really appreciated her for her efforts with us. I hope that shell teach Eng 112. Ill be the first student who will take it.
7779,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,5.0,"She's a nice person, but not a good professor. Gives too much homework with little feedback. When she does, she immediately expects you to be an expert by now. I don't recommend buying/renting a textbook, because it's little use. All she wants you to do is go to writing center with proof, and won't give you your grade until the end of semester."
7780,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111ENF3,1.0,4.0,"she is a nice human being, but as a teacher she's not that good. she expect you to know everything already, and just give papers, 21 papers in total. just 1 grade at the last day. i try hard but this was never enough for her.."
7781,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,4.0,I really enjoyed Professor Sextons class. Her class was very engaging &amp; fun! involving various aspects of learning both visual and auditory . Her writing technique was simplified to most basic level making it easy for anyone who dislikes grammar rules to understand. Id advise anyone who cares about learning and having fun to take this class.
7782,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,"she is the best professor that i've ever had. I'll take English 112 with her . She is available out of class to meet. i have learned a lot in her class. We didn't have to take the final exam because she helped us get an A by constantly helping us revise our work for a better grade. if you are looking for English class , take with her."
7783,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,She is the best professor I've ever had! I will take her for english 112.

7784,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111ENF3,4.0,4.0,"She's really nice and fun being with, and is really good at teaching this subject. However, the essays she has us do, while few, feel like they're the same subject, and the homework can be overwhelming. However, she can help you out if you're having trouble. If you want a Professor to help with your essays, she's one you can go to."
7785,984098,Sophia,Sexton,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111ENF3,5.0,4.0,she is a very straight forward teacher. you show up and get your work done you will keep her happy. make sure to follow the syllabus even if she don't tell you something is due if its on the syllabus make sure you due it and turn it in on time. even if you're one minute late you will earn a zero
7787,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,5.0,3.0,"Please note that the majority of the bad reviews are for his 201 course. A friend took that, said it was hard because 201 is algebra based. I had him for 6 week calc based 232. Really genuine guy, cares about students, lenient grader, always has office hours, responds to email quick. Don't miss lecture, has a lot to cover. Easy labs, challenging HW"
7788,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY201,1.0,5.0,"Totally agreed with the last comments about Arif, he is awful. He has a thick accent and speaks very fast, so you hardly even understand what he is talking about. Exams are 60% of your grade and they are not easy. He is a tough grader and won't give you any partial credits if your answers do not match his solution 100%. A lot of hw and no EC."
7789,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHYS201,1.0,5.0,"If you want to constantly go through anxiety attacks, then this is the right course for you! Arif made this course difficult for no reason. He claimed that he was there to help us, but his actions showed otherwise. He graded so difficult on the exams, the average for all 4 exams were 70 or below and he said that it was good. Horrible professor!"
7790,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY201,2.0,4.0,"Took him for 6 weeks physics and was meh. Frustrating at times because he did not want to work with his students when they asked for help. Was very wishy washy, and never had a solid answer when asked something. Very lecture heavy. If you are new to physics I don't recommend, but if you already have a foundation then you'll do better."
7791,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,040W,1.0,5.0,"Professor Arif does not care about his students. When asked for help he simply says ""try your best"". I took his 6 wk,Phy 201 course and it was the worst mistake of my life. He does NOT work with his students. He does NOT care how hard you try, he will still tear your grade to shreds without thinking twice. I taught myself physics through youtube."
7792,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,3.0,4.0,"Fast-paced at one chapter per lecture. Ask questions so you don't fall behind. Lots of homework but do as many problems as you can until you understand. I had to study quite a bit on my own to understand. If you know the concepts and how to apply them to problems, tests shouldn't be a big problem. You really need to work hard to get a good grade."
7793,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,5.0,4.0,"I've taken PHY231 and 232 with Prof. Arif and both classes have been amazing. He truly cares about students learning and shows a great passion for it. He facilitated a slew of resources to help me succeed: He's always available for office hours, has online lecture videos from the past two semesters, and he always goes over problems in the exams."
7794,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY231,5.0,3.0,"Professor Arif is really good at making sure we understand the material. I admit that he might be too fast sometimes but you are always welcomed to ask and he is very easy to reach outside. People say he gives too much HW but it does not mean u have to do all of it, what matters are your efforts. The labs are fun and does not require alot of work."
7795,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,5.0,4.0,"Very knowledgeable professor and very dedicated to helping you pass, but you'll have to work for it. Be sure to practice the homework questions and review the videos since they'll help you do better in the class, plus the tests/quizzes are similar in format. The material isn't easy, and there's a lot of it, but he's very available if you need help."
7796,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,1.0,5.0,"Arif is the worst professor I have ever taken. He makes his class unnecessarily hard and confusing. He lies a lot about extra credits. His accent is weird and his concept explaining skill is worse than a dull student. Once you ask him a question, he will try to move you away from that question. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING."
7797,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,1.0,5.0,Don't take this professor if you want to learn something. He doesn't have clear grading criteria and he basically grades by his own wish. If you take his class then bring a pillow to class and also bring a pillow for your pillow because your pillow will fall asleep too by listening to his boring lecture. His explanation isn't good enough for pupils
7798,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY231,5.0,4.0,Professor Arif was an amazing Physics professor. This was my first time taking physics and physics is not an easy A or an easy class at all. If you are just looking to get an easy A and not do any work then I suggest you not take physics. He made the class bearable and is willing to go the extra mile to help his students succeed.
7799,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,1.0,5.0,Prof. Arif's Physics class is boring and fast-paced. Students hardly get a chance to ask questions. He gives lots of homeworks. The tests are hard and are completely different from the homeworks. Don't take his class if you want to learn something about physics and get a good grade.
7800,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Arif's Physics classes are really hard. I took his PHY231 and PHY232. I got an A in PHY231. His lectures are long and fast paced. He wants his students to learn a lot of stuff and makes the class unnecessarily complicated. He often gives us pop quizzes too. If you want to take his class, get ready to work hard!"
7801,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,2.0,5.0,"Professor Arif's teaching style was very fast paced and makes topics unnecessarily complicated. He puts his lectures online. For each chapter, it contains 2-3 hours of videos for two semesters. This adds up to 4-6 hours of lecture per chapter and 4 chapters per exam. Even with doing 50+ problems, you'll end up doing 4-5 of them on the exam."
7802,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,5.0,4.0,"Great professor! He wants his students to pass. He offers help and clarification whenever we got stuck. Be sure to ask him questions! This is a hard class, but you should do well as long as you dedicate the time to study in-class notes and HW problems. Learning the concepts is key to understanding the material. Learned a lot from this class."
7803,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY231,1.0,5.0,"Professor Arif spoke too fast during class. Posted over 10-15 hours of videos which he expected students to watch. Had to work over 60 homework problems before each test. Students were often confused as to what to focus on when preparing for tests. Offered a lot of help in and outside of class, but much of the class still struggled."
7804,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,5.0,5.0,This class is not easy. You will fail if you do not study outside of class. Professor Arif is a great guy but I believe his job his rough because he has to cover a lot of chapters in a little span of time while still including labs. Professor really cares for the student to learn rather than the grade. He adds extra points to test.
7805,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY232,4.0,4.0,"He is one of the best physics professors in Northern Virginia Community College. This course is an easy A for those who follows his lectures carefully. He also records every single of his classes and makes them available online before every quiz, so you don't have to worry about in case you miss any of his classes."
7806,1662822,Mohammad,Arif,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Physics,PHY101002W,1.0,5.0,"He was one of the worst professor I have ever had. Physics was one of my favorite subject but after taking his class Im questioning myself now. If you talk him, most likely you will regret later on. So I recommend not to take him. Sure he is a knowledgeable man but he is not a good professor."
7808,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,4.0,"So update: hes actually a pretty hard grader. Hes super nice and chill but when hes grading your work like group projects or individual project, he is like the pickiest grader lol."
7809,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"take this man yo take this man. so damn funny and makes a three hour lecture easy to deal with. easy quizzes, a bit more difficult tests but his classes are worth it. wears weird ties."
7810,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,Professor is THE best. Exams are cool just study. The homework the way its due is hard to explain but basically youll have chapters 1-8 due all on one date. Like I said hard to explain but youll get it once you take his class. Lectures were so fun. He definitely makes history interesting. LOTS of extra credit and I advise for you to do those!
7811,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,Mr. Porter is a great teacher and his lectures are great. He takes a topic that you may think is boring and makes it very interesting. He gives out a bunch extra credit so you can redeem yourself in case of anything. He really cares about his students and history. This is the only class I have been sad about when class was canceled.
7812,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"This professor is absolutely amazing, I loved taking this class. Easy quizzes, slightly harder tests. Awesome lectures, like his classes are long but I genuinely didnt get bored because he teaches it so well. Lots of extra credit opportunities. You wont need the textbook too much unless its for a project. I didnt use it for anything tbh."
7813,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,He is such a great professor and his lectures are informative as well as entertaining. He gives a bunch of extra credit opportunities. Overall a really good professor.
7814,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Homeworks (5 question mc quizzes) are easy and answers are online. LOTS of extra credit. Group projects were easy IMO. Exams were hard-ish but if you pay attention you'll get no lower than a C on them. He's friendly and his lectures are so fun, he makes class enjoyable. His syllabus is clear. There's no reason to get any lower than a B. :)"
7815,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Porter is a great professor, his lectures are engaging and entertaining. It was a stress free environment in where I actually looked forward to going to his class. The Exams are rather difficult, however the many extra credit opportunities make up for it. One of the best. Coming from someone like myself that really means something."
7816,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,4.0,"I agree with others--you CAN get an A in his class, but he doesn't hand them out like Halloween candy. Makes you work for it. He offers lots of extra credit. Be sure you do the extra credit because the tests are hard. He really loves history, so his lectures are great."
7817,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Porter is a great history professor- his lectures are engaging and funny. Gives group projects without much involvement so make sure you are prepared to collaborate with your classmates. Grades the tests fairly strictly, but gives plenty of extra credit opportunities. Overall a great professor."
7818,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,3.0,Professor Porter is hilarious and I would look forward waking up going to his class. He is one of those class clowns. He offers a lot of extra credit opportunists. His test are a little tricky but he does his grading scale by points you receive in his class. He is my favorite professor at NOVA.
7819,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,4.0,If I could give a professor less then 1 I would . His test super hard . He never replies to emails . I submitted extra credit . 11 Essays before they were due and he did not even grade them or give me the extra credit . I would stay away from him . No way to contact him leads to big problems . Not only an issue with me but with my classmates.
7820,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Dr. Porter is one of the best professors at NOVA, he really knows what he teaches and really tries to compare it to the modern era. He also makes a lot of jokes about history, making the class very interesting!"
7821,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"When they say ""class clown"", this is who people are referring too. Never in my life, have I laughed so hard in school. Professor Porter is the best professor I've ever had. No matter what time class is, he's always full of energy and makes history fun to learn. He is a saint."
7822,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,1.0,"I finally found good professor teaching me history. I never thought history is part of my life until Dr. Porter. He has good sense of humor that make you want stay the whole day. He loves Hamster and connect present and past history. I hope I can take his class, again. Thank you Dr. Porter for educating me about life!"
7823,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIST101,5.0,3.0,"I love Professor Porter. He makes me laugh till I cry. He interacts with the class, and has a great sense of humor. Anyone who can make fun of history, yet still teach the facts, is a wonderful professor. I strongly recommend him for any history class."
7824,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,2.0,2.0,"Good professor if you want to hear a good lecture, content was painfully wrong, although this bleeds into tests very little. Multiple instances where professor stated things in lectures that I could find no mention of in either the text, or in any historical record. If you take this professor, be careful what you believe from his mouth."
7825,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS111,5.0,3.0,"Talk about a class clown. Professor Porter was hysterical and he really brought history to life. He was very passionate and he loved to act out events. I learned so much from him, and his attitude towards the subject made me love history even more."
7826,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS121,5.0,3.0,Took his HIS121 course and loved it!! Taking another history course with him
7827,1153784,David,Porter,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,Dr. Porter is by far my favorite teacher in Nova. He always comes to class with a smile and a different tie. He makes boring lectures very entertaining. Hands out multiple extra credits to boost your grade. Overall the class is super easy if you DO THE WORK. If I were you I would take him.
7829,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,5.0,"Had her before and during covid, so we went to online classes for the rest of the semester back in March. Doesn't save her lectures online so you cant access them later because ""you have to be here"" (which is completely unfair because of emergency). Does not explain things well, if you ask a lot of questions she gets impatient and upset."
7830,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,4.0,"One of the few teachers I have not liked at my time at nova, would not recommend very disorganized lectures and tests unlike no other. Save yourself and Take someone else :)"
7831,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,4.0,4.0,"she's an okay teacher. online lectures were a bit hard to understand, but she did her best. I really appreciate Professor Gamgoum's efforts to teach us the material even though the transition from in class to online has been a little tough for everyone. MyMathLab was very helpful and gave explanations on how to solve each problem."
7832,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH242,5.0,3.0,I am currently in Prof. Gamgoum's MTH245 class during the COVID-19 Pandemic. She has handled it much better than all the other profs I currently have. She is passionate about statistics and if you are willing to learn and be curious then you will succeed in her class. There are no free-bees with Prof. Gamgoum but you will pass if you try.
7833,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,5.0,Took her during the COVID-19 Pandemic she has a big language barrier and if you asked questions you got more confused. After we switched to online classes it got worse and it was clearly shown she wasn't prepared. All the bad stuff she shows made it even worse I learned more on my own than by her She is a nice person but not a good professor at all
7834,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,5.0,"Had taken an online statistics class, and it was the most horrible class Ive ever taken. I got a D which is far away from As that I had in every other class. There is no explanation or help, just read the textbook and hope to pass the exam. No chance to make up for missing homework and that effects your test more since there is no other way learn"
7835,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH242,3.0,3.0,"The class is MTH 245, not 242. English is not her first language, hence; you'll have to be patient, ask her to repeat once more, or inquire her after class. Attendance is a must, never be late. You'll pass. She cares that her students want to pass this class. Majority of the tests and quizzes were online. Final is in person."
7836,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,5.0,Her teaching style is disorganized and contradicts herself all the time. She would walk in late to class and makes us stay an extra 5 to 10 minutes after regularly. Her handouts are very confusing and not organized at all. Her MYStat lab quizzes were hard even if you put a couple hours of studying before. Had to self teach the material. AVOID!
7837,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH241,5.0,3.0,"She's a very nice and caring professor if you engage her. She's always willing to stay after class with you if you need extra help. She DOES NOT tolerate tardiness, but overall she's great and offers extra credit. If you're not willing to put in the work, don't take her Made stats fun for me, but she does speed through her lectures so pay attention"
7838,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,3.0,"Frequently contradicts herself on terminologies &amp; lacks ability to explain concepts she introduces or to convey clear instructions for major projects, but gets dismissive or confrontational when asked for clarification. Constant calculation errors in handouts &amp; powerpoints. Changes test dates from syllabus, forgets to upload learning material."
7839,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,5.0,"I'll just say this. If you care to learn anything, If you care about your grades, please, don't take this prof. This is the most frustrating experience I've had at NOVA. There something that needs to be done about mediocre teaching style, changed due dates mid-course and the lack of involvement. I experienced all this and am very unhappy."
7840,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,4.0,"She is by far the most disorganized professor I've ever had. Not only does she walk in 15-20 minutes late every class period and doesn't start teaching until 15 after, she also managed to put our class so far behind in what we should be learning that we now have 4 chapters including tests, quizzes and ALOT of HW to catch up on in the next 3 weeks!!"
7841,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,3.0,Very hard to understand lectures and wastes a lot of class time with her attempt to use technology. Test dates are changed around and not followed by the syllabus. She could be stubborn if you ask her questions and ask her to explain in further detail.
7842,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,5.0,Very hard to understand because of the language barrier. She would speed through lectures without clearly explaining the material. When answering questions she would confuse you more.
7843,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,5.0,Sometimes messes up equations and tends to yell in class &amp; randomly call out students :/ Used to sometimes walk in 10 min after class start time and ended like 5 min after end time. 2 projects which she doesnt explain how to do - i had to go to the tutoring cntr. Wayyy too much hw and doesnt announce deadlines till like 1-4 days before its due
7844,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,2.0,3.0,"Would not recommend taking her class if you are the type of learner who likes things to be broken down. Prof. Gamgoum rushed through material &amp; made it difficult to ask questions. She would make you feel stupid for even asking. I had to seek tutors &amp; teach myself the material. She uses ppts to teach material, had 3 exams &amp; one final."
7845,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,4.0,"I legitimately am not sure this person is an actual teacher, on multiple occasions she couldn't do basic addition and couldn't walk students through using the calculator properly either. She also actually walked out for about half an hour during the final exam, I didn't even know that could happen. I wouldn't trust her to teach me basic math."
7846,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH242,1.0,3.0,She is very rude to students. She laughs and thinks she's being funny and lighthearted I guess but she brings up personal conversations between student and teacher in front of the entire class. She's also very stubborn and unorganized. Reads from her powerpoint a lot. Her exams were pretty easy if you knew the material but she's just a mean person.
7847,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH242,1.0,3.0,"MTH 246 -She is very knowledgable about statistics but a very poor teacher, has trouble listening to what students say and typically talks over them when they ask questions. Very rarely answers the question you asked. Is very bad at having a discussion she is the perfect example of the talking to a brick wall analogy."
7848,272859,Khadiga,Gamgoum,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH241,1.0,5.0,"Literally the worst professor you could possibly take. All she does is read off a powerpoint. You basically have to teach yourself the course. While teaching she tends to yell at random times, thinking that it will somehow make us understand the content more. She is very rude to students, and does a very poor job answering questions."
7850,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,2.0,"I took him for a night class in 2015 at Germanna. I really enjoyed his class. My only complainant is he gave extra credit in return for a positive review on here. However, he shouldn't need to bribe his students because of how enjoyable his class is. I've long graduated now but if the class was offered again at GCC I would take him for fun."
7851,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,3.0,Professor Howes is a good professor. He is understanding of the students needs and makes the class enjoyable. Took his 8-week course and it was super easy. He doesn't give lots of assignments/hw. There are 2 exams for the semester. Easy-going professor that is fun &amp; one that you can get along with.
7852,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,2.0,2.0,"Super easy class. If you take notes, YOU WILL PASS. Don't even read the textbook, its never used. In fact, he said the test answers cannot be based on the book, but his notes. His lectures are funny, but annoying as heck. He talks about his family way more than he should. We would cover a lot more material if he didn't ask weird questions as well."
7853,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS112,5.0,1.0,"This is the best professor ever!! Extra credit opportunities, light work load, lots of clear notes and fun, chill professor! I would definitely retake this class, taking this class is fun and an easy A, you will learn a lot! Only the luckiest students get to be his student."
7854,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"The best professor I've had for college so far. Gives clear and helpful lectures and gives you clearly the material for exams. Easy to get an A if you do your part and study. Also extremely nice, understanding and caring especially through pandemic."
7855,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I could have taken. Honestly, I wish more professors acted like him. Great class! Just show up, and youll pass, the class is enjoyable."
7856,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"I would STRONGLY recommend taking any of Mr. Howes' classes. I read parts of the textbook initially, but it's not needed for the entire class. If you show up, participate, and take notes, you should do fine. There are plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Prepare for a lot of writing on exams. The lectures are memorable and hilarious!"
7857,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"He is the best professor, you need to do essays for exams but believe me he is the best when it comes to teaching history. I learned a lot with him, also he is really really funny and makes lectures way better."
7858,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,Great professor you should not fail his class there are tons of extra credit opportunities.
7859,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,5.0,2.0,"He is a generous teacher, He is a good storytell and his lectures are very useful, make sure to take notes with details and you will pass his class. I highly recommad him!!!"
7860,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,2.0,Professor Howes is a gem. Though he jokingly bullied me the entire semester he was very easy going and lenient. You show up and take extremely good notes you will pass. Just make sure to take exceptional notes or you wont do so well on exams.
7861,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,4.0,2.0,"Entertaining teacher with engaging lectures, would tell anecdotes to keep students awake during class. On the first class he said we would need a PHYSICAL copy of the textbook, he put emphasis on physical, but we never ended up using the book in class. Kinda made me waste 30 bucks. Overall though, a good teacher that I wouldn't mind having again."
7862,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS102,5.0,3.0,I've been Professor Howes classes for over 4 semester now and he is absolutely fantastic. Lectures are long but interesting and he's very good at keeping students engaged with stories and jokes. He's a generous grader and understanding of students. The most important thing is to take detailed notes because exams are lecture based.
7863,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,"He is an amazing professor. I took him for history 101 and 102. I took his 8 week class. There are two exams which were taken at home. They were essay questions which are the exact same as the notes he gave. He gives online quizzes but those are super easy. His lectures tend to be funny, but there is a lot of note taking."
7864,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HI101,2.0,3.0,"An 8-week Summer course with Prof Howes left me underwhelmed. His lectures don't flow and I often have to read ahead to understand the content. And he's always using analogies are often irrelevant to the subject. Without reading the textbook, I'd be completely lost in his class. Sometimes the information he teaches isn't even in the book....."
7865,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS112,5.0,2.0,"He was my favorite professor spring semester! His lectures were long but they were always interesting, he's very passionate about history. He did talk about his family but I didn't mind it. Beware, take very detailed notes during lectures, I recommend going over the slides and writing everything down before class and take lecture notes. Got an A!"
7866,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS112,5.0,4.0,"Professor Howes is a phenomenal teacher. He is a fantastic storyteller and loves history. Lectures are long but interesting. Be warned, to succeed, you must take extensive notes. Tests and quizzes are heavily lecture, not textbook, based. He's a generous essay grader. Do not be on your phone-he will take points off your grade."
7867,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,2.0,5.0,"I ended up dropping his class! He only talked about his family. Did I learn anything about history? NO! Maybe a yes to his family history... He's a great professor but just not for me. Also, I didn't find his slides useful for the tests and quizzes."
7868,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,4.0,3.0,Prof Howes us a solid for choice for those who want to come to class and listen/take heavy notes. The notes will help you on the test. He literally gives you an outline for the exam and you just have to prepare. 2 exams and 1 essay. No real homework except the essay! His lectures are fun cause he tells them as if hes telling a story!
7869,1694252,William,Howes,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS112,5.0,2.0,"10/10 would take again. He's easy-going and teaches in a very logical, easy-to-follow way. Show up, make an honest effort, and you'll do well. Others complain that he talks about his family a lot. Yes, he does. But watch carefully. He is very, *very* good at using ""tangents"" to provide mnemonics or reengage a class that is spacing out. No phones."
7871,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI220,5.0,3.0,THE BEST. gave us straight up points for the 3rd paper. * 3 papers in total. Quizzes throughout the semester (nothing too heavy based on the amount of questions). Made this class fun!
7872,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI220,5.0,4.0,"Professor Stakland was great! His ethics class was super empowering and your lectures are deep! You will have a quiz every class from your reading, so make sure to read! You have 3 papers and the quizzes no other homework. Your midterm and final, you need to know these readings. However, he will provide you what to expect!"
7873,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI227,5.0,4.0,"I took PHI227 during the Fall 2020 semester. The overall course grade was made up of a quiz at the beginning of each class, multiple papers, a midterm exam and a final exam. The topics covered in this class during lectures were relevant and eye-opening and the professor did a good job of remaining neutral and respectful of all students opinions"
7874,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI227,5.0,3.0,Steve is very kind &amp; seemed to be an easy grader. Follow instructions clearly &amp; you should be good. Our class moved online &amp; he was easy to reach &amp; responded to emails in adequate time. Midterms took a while to receive grades back from him because he had to grade each of our papers 1 by 1. Keep track of your grades because he doesn't post them...
7875,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI220,5.0,2.0,"So far, I have taken two of Professor Stakland's classes, and I wholeheartedly recommend both of them. Professor Stakland is a wonderful teacher who really tries to help students engage with philosophy in a meaningful manner. Lectures are by far the best part of his classes. They are funny and very helpful for understanding the assigned texts."
7876,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,4.0,"Was not a big fan of the subject, some days took a solid 8 hours to do all the reading assigned and still did not understand what I had read. The midterm/final covers a huge amount of material that may seem overwhelming so I recommend starting those 2 weeks in advanced. He is more on the lenient side in regards to grading though. Overall hes good."
7877,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI227,4.0,3.0,Such a good professor! I would just make sure to do the weekly readings because there will be a quiz each class. When we moved remote he was really fast at responding to emails and giving good feedback!
7878,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,4.0,4.0,I was worried to fail or just not understand this class but Professor Stakland made philosophy fun and interesting. Be ready to take quizzes on the readings right when you come into every lecture. I suggest you actually read because you won't pass. When moving remote he never provided lectures which made it difficul since you were now on your own.
7879,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI227,5.0,3.0,"Lots of reading, class participation &amp; attendance mandatory, but highly rewarding!"
7880,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHL100,5.0,5.0,"Took logic with him and can say he is one of the best professors I have ever had, logic is a tough course to teach but Stakland does a phenomenal job. All the reading is necessary to truly get a grip of the course, you will be quizzed daily on the readings and will have 3 more books to read. The class is rigorous but highly rewarding."
7881,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHIL111,5.0,4.0,Struggled through the course but professor Stakland was great with breaking down the complexity of Logic
7882,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,3.0,"One of the nicest and funniest professors Ive taken at nova! His lectures are very interesting and funny, he keeps the class interesting. Hes very understanding and cares for his students. Theres a quiz every class On the assigned reading, so you must read! Also participation is a must. Would love to take this class again tbh"
7883,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,3.0,"Hes one of the nicest professors Ive taken at nova! He truly cares about his students, he makes everyone laugh, he always discusses the readings in class and asks us if we have any questions about it. Def take him, Ill miss this class :)"
7884,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,2.0,"Incredible professor! Class is like a book club: you read a lot then talk about it in lecture as he guides discussion. Super interesting and funny guy &amp; he will really make you think about well... everything (as you should in a philosophy class!). Not hard, as long as you show up &amp; do the work you'll ace. One of my all-time favorite professors!"
7885,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,4.0,Hes extremely funny and lecture heavy but he makes it fun and engaging. There is a short quiz at the beginning of each class. They tend to be difficult but if you participate and do the homework you will do well!
7886,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI227,3.0,1.0,"Class is easy, teacher is nice, and class is spent talking as a class. Must participate. We spent a lot of time talking about things that weren't in the text book or we weren't tested on. Hw is several pages, questions from the book. Easy but time consuming. Group project was annoying. He chooses your group. I was with deadbeats. Low expectations."
7887,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI227,5.0,1.0,"NO Papers, quizzes are open book. Always brings the whole class to discuss together. He is really nice."
7888,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,5.0,4.0,Stakland is an awesome professor and genuinely cares about his students
7889,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,4.0,3.0,"Great professor, definitely one of my faves I have taken! His lectures well-spoken &amp; interesting! He is able to actually teach the content well. He assigns readings, which you take a quiz on at the very start of the next class, then spend the rest of the class discussing the readings as a group. There are 3 essays, plus a midterm &amp; final"
7890,2079618,Steven,Stakland,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Philosophy,PHI101,4.0,4.0,"His lectures very interesting and he is able to actually teach the content well. He assigns reading and you take a quiz on it at the very start of the next class then spend the rest of the class going over what was read. There is a midterm, final, and 3 essays. There is no extra credit so make sure to do all the work assigned in order to pass."
7892,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,2.0,"Intro to stats class He is a wonderful, kind professor. The assignment deadlines are outlined clearly on the syllabus, all that is required to do well is to pay attention during lectures and to keep up with the brief bg readings/videos. He encourages students to ask for help if they need it &amp; is willing to work with them so they can succeed!"
7893,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,1.0,"I am glad I took Statistics with him. The course was offered remotely during the summer and with COVID 19 pandemic, Prof. Inyang was very flexible and understanding with due dates and granting extra time for make up. If you do your work, You would do well in his course. Very cool Guy. Take him for MTH 245."
7894,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,3.0,4.0,"Taken as a synchronous remote course. Overall, professor Inyang is an okay choice. He is willing to work with you and will adjust due dates if you give him a valid reason. However, many (sometimes as many as 8) of the assignments will have the same due date. He his also a very late grader, and didn't put most of the grades in until the final week."
7895,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH245,5.0,1.0,"Awesome professor. He actually wants his students to pass. Also he lets students make up HW for full credit if they didn't do it right the first time. 2 tests, HW, attendance HW, quizzes and one small project. All the HW's, tests, quizzes, and project were REALLY easy. Just do the work and get the easy A. Would highly recommend!"
7896,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,4.0,3.0,"Professor Inyang wants everyone to do well, so he's an easy grader and gives good feedback as long as you ask questions. I took him for a hybrid course, so all the work was online, including exams, which he encouraged you to use your notes on. There's one really easy project and some discussion boards, but really laid-back class overall."
7897,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH241,5.0,1.0,He is such a great professor he gives you time to be able to get your work done and if you don't understand something in class he would happy to clarify or meet you after class.
7898,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,2.0,"This was my last semester, and I was afraid of Statistics, but the professor make the course very practical. If you participate in the discussion boards, you learn a lot. So glad I took the course with him. Very funny and cool guy!"
7899,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,1.0,"Awesome and kind professor, would work with you until you learn the material. The lecture notes and assignments were posted weeks in advance on canvas. Due dates were shifted due to COVID19, we had time to finish assignments. If you are serious and willing to learn, you would enjoy his class. Take him for MTH 245! Ignore the negative comments."
7900,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH245,1.0,3.0,"Please do not take this guy, he does not teach and I always found myself teaching myself. He does not care if there is a pandemic going on and if you are overwhelmed with homework for other classes. Please save yourself from taking him!!"
7901,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,1.0,"I am not good in math, but the professor gives you so many opportunities to learn, if you do the homework and other assignments, you should do well. He is very non judgmental and truly care about students. TAKE HIM!!!"
7902,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,3.0,4.0,So he is not bad at all. Im not good at math like honest I hate everything that have numbers but with him was pretty easy to understand. The final is 40% of your grade be aware of that and be aware that he puts so many homeworks for the same day but besides that he is a great professor. He cares about his students.
7903,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,1.0,"Inyang was very accessible outside of class. He actually went through the entire project with us. Homework and quizes were on mymathlab. Sometimes he goes through the questions for practice. There were many discussion boards, but they were easy. Midterm and Final are in person. All other exams are online. He teaches you everything you need to pass."
7904,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,2.0,"I am not good in math, but had to take Stats. He help me to learn by making use of practical situations. For example, one assignment was to watch a video on real life application of statistics and discuss. You have many chances to show understanding . if you are serious, he would help you to pass the class. Very cool , reasonable and fair guy."
7905,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,2.0,"Very kind and caring professor. I Had a lot of issues due to COVID19, worked with me so that I completed the course. Lectures are done through zoom. Quizzes and homework are on Mymathlab, Test are on canvas. If you try, he would guide you to learn Stats. Take him for MTH 245. I got a B, and before this class, I struggled a lot in math."
7906,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,2.0,Take him for MTH 245. The lectures notes are posted before class on canvas and class meets using Zoom. Everything you need to pass the course is provided and all you have to do is complete the assignments. So many activities to demonstrate mastery and pass the course. I wish I had take the course with him the first time instead of taking it online
7907,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,3.0,4.0,"Did the Hybrid Stats 1. Uses a mix of Canvas and MyMathLab, very disorganized in the beginning. Once we moved completely online, it became more organized and easier. A little confusing to understand. It's do-able, but a lot of work. You have to teach yourself a lot. Lots of homework disguised as ""attendance quizzes"""
7908,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,3.0,"Very caring professor. Willing to help if you need extra help. Will explain the concepts in different ways until you get it. Wished I took Stats with him the first time. Lecture notes and homework are posted in advance online. If you are looking for easy grades, look elsewhere."
7909,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,5.0,2.0,I am glad I took MTH 245 with him. He made the connection between Statistics and real world situations very clear. I can finally understand what I read or hear in the news about different studies. If you are serious and do your work you would be successful! Lecture notes are posted online. Take him for Stats. Awesome professor.
7910,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,4.0,Worst professor ever! He can't teach and has an accent. All of his homework and quizzes are online. Two exams online and the final in class. He grades assignments the last minutes. Never take him.
7911,1115398,Inyang,Inyang,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH261,5.0,3.0,"I am glad I took MTH 261 with him. Lectures were straight to the point. He would help you understand the material, Math is not my strong subject, but finally passed the course with him. Great and reasonable professor. Take Him for MTH 261."
7913,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,1.0,"Majority of the time we spent watching a documentary every class for a 5 page critique after. Lectures are basically him just going over a PowerPoint he also puts on canvas for the tests, easy A. Gives extra credit if you do critiques"
7914,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,4.0,3.0,This class was very easy. Very clear on what you need to know. However I didnt find his humor or sarcasm particularly charming and found his lectures to be a bit dry. He doesnt speak very loudly so if you have trouble hearing you might want to sit up front.
7915,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,4.0,2.0,"If you take Prof. Ehle's class once a week, you will have an exam every week. He does not lecture but will post the entire exam on BB. Only have to answer 20 out of 30 question on exam for 100%. One 4-page critique paper due at the end of the semester along with 5-6 Discussion Board critiques. Would recommend but you have to teach yourself."
7916,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,1.0,You get easy quizzes check. Easy and very informative homework check (discussion boards). Choose 1 out of literally hundreds of articles to read. Talks about politics. 1 project on 7-up which is quite an interesting project. Has one optional test. Drops the lowest test. Will roast late- people sometimes which is quite entertaining.
7917,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,4.0,2.0,Dr. Elhe was very sarcastic and his class was THE EASIEST. It seemed like a lot of work at first but all of it was super easy and requires very little effort. His quizzes were heavy but very easy. No final required. blackboard was used very often.
7918,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCIOLOGY201,5.0,2.0,I took this class during the Summer. He is a great teacher. very calm and understanding. he will help you outside of class if you don't understand the subject.
7919,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,5.0,2.0,Very Easy professor. Tests are very easy most of the questions are common sense. Barely studied and got an A
7920,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,5.0,1.0,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND HIM, EASY A OR B. AS LONG AS YOU SHOW UP TO CLASS AND DO ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS THAT IS REQUIRED YOU WILL PASS EASILY. HE IS VERY FUNNY WITH KIND HEART! I LOVE HIM! I HAD A GREAT SEMESTER WITH HIM. HE IS VERY RESPECTFUL."
7921,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,5.0,1.0,great instructor with a light sense of humor. easy exams as long as you pay attention to his lectures. offers a optional final. an easy A as long as you listen and go over notes
7922,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,2.0,"Best Professor ever! He's a really funny guy and is very straight forward, lectures are amazing and not to mention out of the 3 test exams he takes the lowest grade out and the final is optional. i've recommended him to so many of my friends and i'd take him again if i could. just trust me and TAKE HIMM!!!!"
7923,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Ehle is one of the best professors I've come across at NVCC. If you  need a Social Science class don't hesitate to take him! 30 question exams (3 &amp; 1 optional, drops lowest grade) but you only answer 20, leaving 10 blank. He's hilarious, sweet, and super blunt. His lectures are definitely fun and interesting and they bring up discussions!"
7924,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,1.0,"Easiest class. Always adds points to every exam. 30 question exams (3 tests + 1 optional test, drops lowest test grade) but you only answer 20, leaving 10 blank.  Easy homework once every 2 weeks &amp; final is optional. 1 4-page paper that he gives everyone an A on. Literally impossible to not get an A."
7925,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,1.0,"He's an amazing teacher. Yes, he is an easy teacher but you will learn a lot through discussions. Take Prof Ehle!"
7926,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,4.0,1.0,"Mr. Ehle is such a fun, hilarious and caring teacher. I loved showing up to his class. He really enjoys when people refute his argument and it's a great way for him to learn your name (although he hilariously messes up). He's super sweet and gives a few tests with an optional test to raise your grade. Only 8 assignments total with a short paper."
7927,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,1.0,"Awesome teacher! Very blunt, not scared of open discussions about anything and everything. Videos almost every class, slept through about all of them. Just do your work - easy A take him!"
7928,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,1.0,"He is a fantastic teacher!!! He is easy fair grader!!! Just go to class and listen,which won't be hard he is interesting"
7929,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC101,5.0,1.0,"He is the best teacher!! Easy to understand, we watch interesting movies and he gives extra credit! As long as you listen and come to class you will pass with flying colors!!! Take him before he retires"
7930,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,4.5,2.0,"Very good professor. He knows what he is talking about. Very interesting lectures and really likes when students comment on things and give their opinion. Also a funny guy. Test weren't hard, he gives all the answers in lecture. Overall great professor, would take a class he taught again."
7931,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Ehle is a nice guy, but the classes can get boring after awhile as they normally consist of a powerpoint and/or an extremely long video. Other than that, the tests are quite easy and showing up is somewhat optional."
7932,328924,John,Ehle,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC100,5.0,1.0,I came like 3 times to class the entire semester xtremely stoned and i got a B. Literally best teacher ever. Grading criteria is very confusing and he doesnt give back tests but totally does what he can to help you pass if you show effort
7934,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,3.0,2.0,"majority of the semester was focused on 2 papers and then a major 5 page research paper. All she ever told me was include my detail, you also have to print 20+ copies every time you do an essay &amp; stapled. She let us out of class early majority of the time. Sucked for those who only had that class one day bc most times wed be there for 10 minutes"
7935,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,3.0,"Idk how she's still a professor. She doesn't teach and her only feedback is ""more detail."" Assigns essays about sensitive topics and demands unnecessary details about them. You have to print like 25 copies of every essay for the entire class. Doesn't give rubrics or clear grading criteria at all, and most classes got dismissed after 5 minutes."
7936,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,2.0,5.0,The only thing we did in this class was write papers. In the two months before we changed to remote classes we wrote a piece at the beginning of the class and wrote around five papers. And if you pour your heart out into a paper you could be told it needs a lot more detail
7937,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,4.0,3.0,"Spring2020. She's a great professor and I would take her again. You write essays and print out copies. Additionally, you read a part of it and answer questions. So, participation matters. She takes attendance everyday. Doesn't grade anything until the end of the semester. She still hasn't graded my assignments. Show up, participate, do your papers"
7938,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,"I honestly enjoyed this class. She is very straightforward. We had 3 papers &amp; a few random in class writings, 1 book we had to read. Choose this professor if youre a good writer. She has no problem answering questions if you have them, I always got great feedback. I made my papers somewhat personal &amp; she was genuinely interested in what wrote."
7939,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,3.0,"I can honestly say that I didnt learn anything in this class. She assigned a total of 3 essays throughout the semester, which were the only things that we were graded on. She gave very vague directions on what she was looking for, and was a tough grader. Most classes I was only there for a couple minutes because she didnt have anything for us."
7940,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,3.0,3.0,"Surprisingly, I passed. I felt during the semester she was a tough grader, guess not so much. One-on-one sit downs on how you can make your paper A worthy. 3 papers including 1 research and a handwritten final exam on notebook paper about a book. I'd only recommend this class if you're confident in your writing skills, It should be easy if so."
7941,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,4.0,"I took Professor Friedmann's 6-week session this summer. I thought I had done very well in the class- she gave me A's and A-'s on all of the assigned essays and short papers, and always gave me very, very positive feedback on my writing. I just checked my posted grade and it is a C. I don't understand."
7942,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,4.0,I took this class way before and just decided to rate this professor. Very tough on grading papers with little feedback. So many papers assigned in such little time I remember I was not able to do ONE and it hurt my grade. Super upset that one paper made me not pass this class. I would stay away from this teacher if you care about your GPA.
7943,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,3.0,3.0,"Only complaints are that her grading scale isnt clear and she doesnt provide rubrics for any papers but the papers were relatively simple. She also doesnt use bb to input grades so you wont know your grade unless you go to her office hours. She doesnt really teach anything new to improve anyones writing so, easy class if youre already a good writer"
7944,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,4.0,5.0,I love that if you had any questions or asked for advice she was always there to help you.
7945,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,2.0,3.0,She is a nice professor if you get to know her but aside from that it is hard to guess what your grade could ultimately be. She gives very little info. on what to expect for the grading rubric for the final paper along with the final book test. I would not recommend this class for anyone who cares about their GPA.
7946,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,3.0,3.0,"She can let you out early, but attendance is mandatory. She asks for a hard copy regardless of whether someone uses a computer, but a great teacher nonetheless"
7947,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,3.0,3.0,"Honestly, I have not learnt a single thing throughout this course. Prof. Friedmann is very nice, but this was the most boring class ever. Can barely recall what we have done and you have to print out your essays for everyone in the class to read. She also hates technology so nothing is on BB. She gives nice, personal feedback though."
7948,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,4.0,3.0,"Professor Friedmann is a solid choice. She does take attendance a lot, so don't skip. The only downside to her class is that you need to print out copies for each and every student, including the teacher when you write essays, etc. She's nice, and gives nice feedback if you're a good writer. If you include details in papers, she'll give good grades"
7949,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,3.0,"I took this class bc I had no clue about looking up teachers beforehand. I honestly think she's insane. Lots of writing but no usable feedback. Grading criteria is all over the place. No lectures, so you don't learn anything but there is still sporadic attendance taking for a grade (she just picks random days???). Let out early a lot. Don't do it."
7950,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,3.0,1.0,"If you're a good writer she will love you and the class will be an easy A. She offers very little feedback other than ""more details"". I submitted papers with glaring grammatical errors that she missed. Need access to a printer, you'll have to print 20+ copies of your papers for peer review multiple times a year. Lots of in class writing."
7951,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,3.0,3.0,"good teacher. She makes you write a lot in her class, but for the most part it is not hard work. She's kind of a tough grader though. Her class could be an easy A if you are a good writer."
7952,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,2.0,"No real lectures just a couple papers. Easy A. She's very understanding and offers good feedback. Not really sure what I learned but I got an A. Last couple weeks there was no class, just check in to show her progress on research paper. How are people saying her class is hard?"
7953,334328,Jane,Friedmann,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,3.0,Don't do it... just don't do it whatever you do...
7955,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,2.0,4.0,"Professor Solis is a very nice person, but due to his accent along with his faulty microphone, his lectures were very hard to understand. He seems to be very understanding with the grading, also all of his quizzes and tests are on Quizlet."
7956,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECCS201,1.0,5.0,"If you are not willing to treat his opinion the same way you treat the ultimate truth, dont take him."
7957,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,4.0,4.0,Professor Rodriguez Solis is a great Professor. Just like any class if you don't do what is asked then you will not pass... such as reading the textbook. Professor Rodriguez Solis lectures are very insightful and he connects his own information with what is in the book. Do what you need to do and Professor Rodriguez Solis will always help if needed
7958,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,4.0,"Great professor, caring, always willing to help. I met with him several times in his office and after the pandemic, via Zoom. He was so helpful and invested in helping his students succeed. Come prepare to work, you will learn a lot with a great partner by your side. I would highly recommend him."
7959,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,5.0,3.0,"Excellent professor. He knows his craft. Intense class, but if you do your weekly reading, which usually is just a chapter, it is not difficult to keep up. Fair all around with clear grading criteria. Highly recommended"
7960,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON202,3.0,4.0,This was a tough class for me. This class is application heavy which means youll be solving math problems because it is micro economics.  if youre into a almost math class hands on type of class this in the class for you. Great professor I would recommend him. Make sure you stay with his pace or you fail. NOT for lazy people. Keep up w/ it.
7961,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,3.0,3.0,All exams and quizzes are online except for the final which is hard so you need to study for it.
7962,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,4.0,3.0,"Students who wrote bad reviews were just expecting an easy A class. He was a great professor, he knows the class objectives and he gives good examples in his lectures when he's explaining a topic. However, sometimes the lectures can get a little bit boring. He mostly explains curves and models in the class, so it's better to read the homework/book."
7963,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Rodriguez is the best professor I have had in NOVA so far. He cares about your progress and he is always available after class. He met the class virtually during our class days and he recorded the meeting for review, which was very helpful. He gives weekly quizzes, some are hard, but he provides all you need in Modules. I'd take him again."
7964,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, he lays out all the material on Canvas very clearly and he provides lots of extra resources. He is always very respectful and available after class. During the pandemic, I met with him a couple of times via Zoom and he was very helpful. I have a B because I did not do so well on the first exam. Highly recommended"
7965,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO202,5.0,3.0,"I do not understand how my classmates can rate Mr. Rodriguez with such disdain. I have seen so many that just want an easy A with no effort, that is no college. His grading criteria are very clear and he has a great Canvas setup. He provides students with a free textbook, PowerPoints, handouts, and educational videos. Great professor, take him"
7966,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,3.0,4.0,the outline of his course arent so bad. the homework is manageable although he could be a bit easier on the application problems. attendance is mandatory. if u are 2 minutes late hell deduct points from ur participation grade. i think he should give at least a 5 min grace period to be somewhat considerate of ppl being a little late
7967,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON202,2.0,2.0,"I think he needs to correlate his lecture within the assignments so that its easier to understand the homework material. Also needs to work on being straight forward with his lectures bc he can be confusing. Hes a tough grader when it comes to short answer questions. If you want to pass, Id suggest to do all your online homework(quizzes/test)."
7968,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON202,2.0,4.0,"I believe hes a mediocre professor as a whole, considering most of his tests/quizzes are quite complicated since some of the material isnt taught within lecture accurately, however the hybrid aspect of his course are somewhat useful bc majority of homework are online. I think he needs to be more clear on the application assignments. Overall 2/5."
7969,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECO201,5.0,4.0,"Solid professor, very easy to talk to and learn from. His accessibility outside of class provides lots of 1-on-1. Lecture heavy, but frequently checks in with class for understanding. If you do the readings and attend class ready to learn, easy A. He does use Lockdown Browser, so integrity is key. Overall, I enjoyed his teaching and insight."
7970,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON202,1.0,4.0,"If you want to pass your Econ class I recommend not choosing Jose. He does not teach what is on the quizzes, is very rude when you try to ask questions, and just an overall horrible teacher. Best of wishes if he is the only Econ teacher left lol."
7971,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON202,1.0,4.0,"I am not the type to dislike teachers, but Professor solis was something else. He is very rude and won't let you make up any work. Barely learned in class and the things we did learn in class were not on the quizzes and test. DO NOT TAKE HIM if you want a good grade"
7972,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON201,5.0,2.0,"I don't understand the negative reviews on this site. Jose is a good teacher who is always open to help you if you don't understand something from the class. You are expected to do weekly quizzes, but these are multiple-choice for the most part (I spectacularly messed up an application test, but that was on me). If you respect him, he respects you"
7973,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON201,2.0,5.0,Gives homework with out proper instructions. Exams will have questions that he did not teach. Not a very good teacher. Does not like it when we ask questions in class. Take a different teacher if you want to learn economics.
7974,969779,José,Rodríguez Solís,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Economics,ECON202,3.0,4.0,"It was very hard to pass this class, lectures were hard to understand and follow. You have to read all the chapters and PP slides to pass the quizzes and exam. Most of the topics for the quizzes were not discussed in class. If you submit your homework late, you'll get a zero. So, no credit for late submissions. Be ready to study."
7976,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO102,5.0,2.0,"If you are majoring in BIO/Medical field, he is the best professor who knows the material from the heart, and you should take his class. He passionate about the subject. He provided a study guide for exam, if you put 8 hours into it, you will the material and pass the exam with an A."
7977,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO102,1.0,4.0,"I picked the class since the reviews here were okay. He does not take questions kindly, so if you want to ask a question and clarify material after class save your time. His tests are quite awful and follow a riddle format rather than straight to the point questions. When giving him constructive criticism he will stonewall you. Save your money."
7978,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO102,1.0,4.0,"These reviews were barely accurate. He's super rude, makes subtle insults, and can not take constructive-criticism. Not to mention, his study guides are not like his tests. He also tends to talk more about things unrelated to biology which will derail you from even learning."
7979,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,1.0,4.0,He self praise himself alot.
7980,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,2.0,4.0,He doesn't like if anybody ask him any question during the lecture .His exams are exactly like study guide so getting an A is easy .He doesn't like to discuss exam questions after exams in case you don't understand anything as he doesn't want to disclose the correct answer which is weird.
7981,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,1.0,4.0,Prof Peglar is very rude and sometimes get disrespectful towards the students
7982,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,2.0,3.0,"Some exams were exactly like the study guides, so it made the exams easier. He seems very passionate about biology so he often rambles and talks about things ""that we don't need to know,"" but he wants to talk about it anyway. He also gets off topic A LOT and quite a few times he would speak on political and sensitive topics unrelated to biology."
7983,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,4.0,3.0,"Professor Peglar is a good choice for BIO 101. Gives boring, but very informative lectures. The labs are straight forward, as all of them are from the lab manual. The exams can be long at times, but all of them are multiple choice and true/false. The exams are worth 70% of the grade, so be sure to do good on those. Do the work, and you will be fine"
7984,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,4.0,2.0,Peglar made BIO 101 managable. Just do your homework and labs. He seems to grade by completion a lot.
7985,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,5.0,2.0,"His lectures are easy (you do have to take notes), the study guides are similar to the exams, made bio interesting, and labs were very easy. I failed BIO 101 in the past with a previous professor but after taking Peglar class, I knew that I would definitely pass!"
7986,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,5.0,2.0,"He is a good professor, gives exams on the ""Study guides"" as it is. You do need to read some powerpoints as they are what's on the exam. Don't skip classes or lectures, do the occasional homework and it's an easy A."
7987,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,5.0,3.0,One of my fav professors at NOVA. He really explains the material in a way that you will understand while making lecture interesting with his stories and tangents. Gives study guides for all exams (that are exactly the same as the real exam :)) I personally didn't use the textbook. Really good guy and would take again.
7988,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO102,5.0,4.0,Professor Peglar is a real specialist. He is very passionate and presents amazing knowledge of what he is teaching but his lectures are very long and boring. He gives his best to teach students as much as he can by bombarding them with an overwhelming amount of information. His tests are very long and complicated although study guides quite helpful
7989,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,2.0,4.0,"for a bio 101 class, he makes this class much more difficult than it needs to be. His homework assignments are not overly difficult, but are extremely tedious and he makes you handwrite most of it. study guide for test barely helped as the test was much more difficult than it. overall, this class is difficult and tedious for its 101 level"
7990,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,3.0,2.0,Took him for bio 101 and Im going to take him for Bio 102. Hes a chill guy. Material is kinda difficult but he makes it easy to pass his class.
7991,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,5.0,2.0,Peglar is a great professor who really cares about his students. I took his 6 week BIO 101 class and he made it easy for everyone to pass and gives a few chances for extra credit and make up work. He provides study guides that are exactly like the tests and will stay for study sessions.
7992,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,4.0,3.0,"He's really nice and funny, but be ready to study the material. He posts study guides up that are almost exactly like the tests so they help a lot. He's really helpful when you don't understand something. He's not a hard grader or a hard teacher, the material is just hard, so he tries to make it fun and easy as he can."
7993,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,5.0,1.0,"I enjoyed professor peglars class this semester, theres not much homework, youre mainly graded on tests and lab, so show up and pay attention and theres no way you can fail because hes a good teacher."
7994,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,5.0,5.0,"good guy, took us to green festival wihch was entertaining"
7995,1136218,Michael,Peglar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Biology,BIO101,4.0,4.0,"Took him for Bio 101. He is a great professor and is very passionate about Bio. Great sense of humor as well. He is very lecture heavy so if you're passionate about bio take him. He handed out practice exams which were the only reason I passed his class, I would not of been able to pass based off only lectures."
7997,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH264,3.0,3.0,Professor Nong is a good teacher who is alright at explaining stuff but has a really bad habit of going on very long tangents about things that can easily last up to half an hour. Attend the class and do the practice exams because the tests are almost identical.
7998,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH267,2.0,3.0,"(took him online so YMMV) Pros: tests were just slightly edited versions of the study guide, he was super easy to contact Cons: joked around too much imo and was vaguely rude, used mymathlab for everything, lectures weren't the best Avoid for mymathlab. I assume he's better in-person based on all of these other reviews, but I'm not a fan."
7999,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,3.0,3.0,"I took this professor during the Covid-19 in the spring semester, he is great at teaching and explaining concepts. A lot of homework but gives you enough time to do them. He made things easier during the pandemic. However, he gets heartbroken even if you don't do well in his exams. But he still gives you plenty of ways to improve your grade."
8000,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,4.0,3.0,"Keeps class very entertaining and keeps you very engaged in lecture. For the summer Cal 2 course, we had homework that he graded by hand so dont worry about webassign!"
8001,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,4.0,4.0,"If you want an easy class, this class is not for you. He gives us lots of homework and he do not take attendance. HOWEVER, I guarantee you the techniques he teaches in class was amazing! I used to think he was tough until I enroll with a different professor, then I realized the way he explained was so much easier to follow."
8002,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,5.0,4.0,Three exams One Final and HW on Aleks. There was a TON of homework and it took me forever to accomplish it. I learned a lot and you will if you do it as intended. Kids I talked to in class that were struggling didn't do the hw or tried to cram it all before the test. Every test has extra credit and the way he grades tests is heavily in your favour.
8003,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH271,4.0,3.0,"He knows how to solve basically anything. Sometimes goes a bit too fast but he is very knowledgeable and his lectures are never boring. Yes exams are hard, but the computer projects and homework boost the grade so much. He literally walks you through the computer projects.. Great teacher, sad I cannot take him for calc III."
8004,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,1.0,5.0,spends time doing problems which are nothing like the test.. atleast make the content relevant to the students
8005,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,2.0,4.0,honestly he isn't a bad professor but his tests are more on the rigorous side. take someone else if you want a better grade for yourself
8006,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,5.0,3.0,"he is a good instructor. The materials on the test were actually covered in class including homework questions and lecture examples. Pay attention and don't skip class because you will be behind if you do. He is easy to reach and gives us exact sections to study for the exams. If you are focused and a good notetaker, this professor is for you."
8007,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,be prepared to teach yourself while he jokes away
8008,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,4.0,3.0,"In my opinion he is a great professor. He actually tries to teach his students the foundations and important concepts necessary to solve problems. He does not expect them to remember every identity or formula, but rather be able to use the very basic one to derive the one you are trying to use. Does lots of examples in class as well."
8009,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,2.0,4.0,"I personally found his class funny. I learned calculus as well however, he goes off topic by trying really hard to teach us about different real life concepts of math by making up stories. Average professor and quite funny. I passed but will not be taking him again due to his challenging computer projects and final exam."
8010,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,"Take the class If you like difficult math exams and even if you attend the class and do all homeworks you will most likely get a C if you're average at math. If you're good at math, take him."
8011,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH263,4.0,2.0,"Dont miss a class and you will get an A. Lets you have a sheet cheat during exams, so you dont really need to memorize formulas. He does not give extra credit nor curves grades, however, he is an easy grader and will give you some credit even if you didnt get the answer correct."
8012,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH163,1.0,5.0,Funny jokester who talks about his personal life half the time and half the time talks about math. Tests are not easy even if you study. Asian professors are not lenient at all. Had to withdraw.
8013,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH173,1.0,5.0,his tests are nothing like the homework questions in the textbook
8014,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH173,1.0,5.0,please avoid. I never got a D in my life but I did in calculus because of him. All he is good at is making jokes.
8015,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH173,3.0,5.0,"do not take him for calculus. his exams are OK. However, his final is brutal. He puts the most difficult functions on there. I understood all the concepts of calc 1 but still got a C because there way no way on earth anyone could evaluate those functions without taking 20 minute long per question and there were 12 questions on the final. avoid him!"
8016,1471457,Kumnit,Nong,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,5.0,1.0,He's the best prof.
8018,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG101,4.0,2.0,"An actual no-bias review: As a student who does not study at all and is pretty lazy but still tries, I thought this class was perfect. The only real work is writing essays, which you have around a month to do for each. Unless you are a moron and can't write a decent essay, this will be a very easy class. Class never goes full length. Can skip."
8019,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,"I've taken ENG 111 and 112 with Dr. Casal and loved both classes. She really cares about her students and wants them to do well. She is great about talking with you if you feel stuck or need a little extra help with something. BUT be aware she puts you in groups for the whole semester! It's not hard though, just participate! Fun class."
8020,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,1.0,4.0,Definitely shows favorites and if you get on her bad side she will grade your papers lower. In addition she cuts classes short so incase you actually want to learn you wont. The whole course is basically self taught. She also hates questions and will tell you everything is on canvas.
8021,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,Dr. Casal is AMAZING. She is tells such fun stories and really wants the bests for her students. Some students would argue her class is hard but if you do the BASICS you can pass with an A or B. DONT USE YOUR PHONE IN CLASS. seriously not that hard. she hates phones. DO THE HOMEWORK. seriously just turn in stuff on time. PARTICIPATE!
8022,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG112,5.0,3.0,"I want to be her when I grow up. She's an amazing person and teacher. Very funny and personal, you get to know her as she teaches. Group heavy and your group contributes to your final grade. Not a class for someone who has opinions they can't leave at the door, she often makes you write arguments against the side you personally favor"
8023,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG237,5.0,2.0,"If I could give a higher rating for Dr. Casal I would! I was excited to go to this class every week because every time I left I felt refreshed, confident, and inspired. She is quirky and funny and gives great advice. You will have a great time participating. The only downside is her instructions get jumbled because she isnt very orgnaized."
8024,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,2.0,"I was incredibly lucky to have Dr Casal as my first professor in my college career. She is an amazing author, poet, and woman. You will not regret taking any class of hers. For the past two semesters, I have purposefully sought out classes taught by her. Dr Casal is an amazing professor, but an even better person."
8025,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Casal is a nice, intelligent professor! She is an amazing storyteller, and although she might seem intimidating, she really just wants you to do your best! Before a paper is graded, you'll bring it to her in a ""conference"" and she gives really insightful feedback on how to improve upon it and gain a better grade. She enjoys giving A's!"
8026,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,4.0,3.0,She is a good professor! If you follow the syllabus you are gonna be fine. Choose a good partners because that gonna be your group for the entire semester
8027,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,2.0,"Professor Casal was truly the best teacher I have ever had. She is very caring, and wants you to succeed. She very rarely takes attendance, but makes class so enjoyable it is worth it to go. You do group work throughout the entire semester, however, you pick your own groups. I loved her class and would take her again if she had available slots."
8028,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG125,5.0,2.0,"She is very nice teacher, she helps you with your problem. There are two papers that are due at the end but she gives you the time to do. She also looks at your paper a week before they are due because she takes her time to make corrections to help you get a better grade in class."
8029,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG242,5.0,4.0,"You will be working in a group during the entire semester, so if you don't like that, do NOT take this class. Other than that, the class was as simple as doing the readings and saying something about them in class. We wrote 2 papers worth 50% of our grades, but if you work with her your almost guaranteed an A. She does not tolerate excuses!!!"
8030,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG125,5.0,3.0,I took her ENG125 course and I thought she was hilarious. I would take her course again. Her class wasnt even that hard either.
8031,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG112,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Laura Casal is a great English Professor. She is a poet. There were 2 argument essays, 1 group debate, visual argument essay and the final project in this class. She is pretty linear but you need to attend class regularly and listen to her. She also provided some extra credits. Great Professor with hilarious lectures!!!"
8032,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG125,5.0,2.0,The best professor I have ever had in my entire life. She is amazing and a complete inspiration in life.
8033,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG125,4.0,3.0,"Great professor, very nice! She loves to talk about her life and her life experiences. She isn't a tough grader and she is very helpful. I would recommend that you take her."
8034,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG125,4.0,2.0,Casal is such an awesome soul. A poet!! BUT she definitely needs to be more clear on her assignments. PAY ATTENTION. Avoid asking questions because she will direct you to the syllabus and pass it off as a dumb question. Assignments are pretty easy once there's clarification (she's too broad)
8035,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG125,5.0,1.0,Dr. Casal is not only a Professor she a poet. she is absolutely amazing. Just listen to her and you will easily get an A. If you don't take an A in her class then something is wrong with you because she loves her students wants to help and give a clear grade for them.
8036,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG112,5.0,3.0,She is a great professor! Her feedback is something that really helped to become a better writer and I took her advice with me and it helped me with other classes. I think this is the class that I've learned the most in so far.
8037,412233,Laura,Casal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG125,4.0,3.0,Great professor!!! Would def take again?English and writing was never my thing but I'm so glad I took this class. You have to read a lot but she lets you use your notes on the quizzes. There are 2 papers you have to write on poems that you choose and a group project instead of a final.
8039,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH261,1.0,4.0,He likes to read the power point presentation and that's all -- he doesn't take the time to explain step by step the exercises.
8040,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,"Do you see lots of good ratings here? Exactly. The final grade is comprised of 5 exams, each worth 20%. Exams are multiple-choice &amp; some are worded strangely. He is horrible at using zoom. He also just follows ppts. &amp; goes thru pre-solved problems &amp; does not explain how he got to certain steps or simplified problems. He is also rude. Save ur GPA"
8041,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH163,1.0,5.0,"Will not do any partial credit. ALL grades are exams. No projects. Lectures are copy-paste from the textbook, no extra input or help. Uses the ""none of the above"" option of exams. Imagine doing all of the correct work, but messing up on that last step. then getting a 65 because of it. Unacceptable to the student, unrewarding."

I took calc in high school &amp; got an A+, so I know what a good teacher is. Prof Izadi has a foreign accent that is hard to understand &amp; doesnt care for his students. You are better off taking an online self-pace course than him GradeExam 80%+Final 20%"
8044,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,"He doesn't care whether you pass or fail the class. Very unreasonable and stubborn grading. Also, your grades were based on tests only. His lectures are also not very helpful whatsoever, so you pretty much have to learn everything on your own. Unless you are exceptionally good at math, I do not recommend taking this teacher at all."
8045,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH271,1.0,3.0,Dont waste your money and time . He is cold professor he doesnt care about students .
8046,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,4.0,"All NOVA STEM professors are awful!! At the end of the day, you're gonna have to teach yourself the material, if your questioning whether to take statistics online or in-person chose online! Search up the questions! This is my second time taking statistics at NOVA (past professor was also bad) and I at least had LESS WORK to do by taking it online."
8047,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH245,1.0,4.0,"A fairly cold professor, doesn't really care if his students pass or fail. Exam takes up way more of your grade percentage than it should and makes the homework a bit pointless. I'd stay away."
8048,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH261,1.0,5.0,"100% the most inconsiderate and difficult professor I have ever worked with. He doesn't care if you pass or fail, doesn't matter to him. 4 exams make up 80% of your grade. I repeat, 80%! Also, there are 8 quizzes that make up the remaining 20%. Test feedback is worthless, doesn't give correct answers for you to study with."
8049,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,1.0,3.0,"It hurts to do this but it must be said, I wouldn't advise this professor to anyone, only ended up here due to schedule restraints. All homework and quizzes are online but if you dont pass the final or midterm it doesn't matter. Pretty much have to teach yourself."
8050,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,4.0,"You have to study for most of the parts yourself. He is using the questions in the textbook, so if you do all the homework and know how to solve those problems, you can pass. It isn't easy though . I didn't sleep before final day to get an A. 4 exams, 1 final. All are 20%."
8051,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,4.0,"One of the most difficult teachers I have encountered.

8054,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH166,3.0,4.0,He taught the theory of the class very well. Harder to understand the application though.
8055,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH160,1.0,5.0,Dariush Izadi is the worst professor because he didn't teach us in detail.
8056,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH163,1.0,4.0,"Honestly he was truly a terrible professor. What he taught in class was super easy and basically what i learned in high school algebra but his midterm and Pearson had much harder content that we didn't go over. He always made mistakes during lectures and when we would correct him he would get mad. Terrible teacher, would not recommend"
8057,896243,Dariush,Izadi,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH163,5.0,3.0,of course math is hard but he tries his best to teach it and most of the grades are on Pearson anyways so u just have to pass midterm and final !

8063,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH151,1.0,5.0,She is horrible. She has no idea what she is doing she is so rude and disrespectful to her students. she is aggressive and gives an attitude and is very sassy. After leaving her class you will always have a bad taste in your mouth. Please do your self a favor and drop her class
8064,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH154,1.0,1.0,"This is my last semester in NOVA, yet I have never had such a horrible learning experience . Never had a professor as unprepared as Mrs. Roberts - she is a shame to our wonderful community college. I have lost a year of my life to stress from her inability to use technology, unwillingness to answer emails, and her distasteful attitude vs. learning."
8065,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH154,1.0,5.0,Pretty sure a rat would teach better than she can.
8066,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,1.0,2.0,Poor lady has been put on an online setting when she has very little idea
8067,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH151,1.0,5.0,If you have ANY chance to switch teachers do so now. By far the worst teacher Ive ever had in my entire schooling career. She doesnt even name the assignments that are due and is clueless on what she is talking about. She also does not know how to use canvas or anything on her computer matter of fact. Save ur self and dont ever take this class
8068,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH154,1.0,5.0,This professor is the worse. I NEVER met someone so unorganized and she lacks of communication. She never checks her email and does not know how to use CANVAS. She assigned a ton of homework the first day but I did not hear about half of the assignments until we met the second day. She goes way too fast and she expects us to read her mind.
8069,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH164,1.0,5.0,"Unorganized, Lost, Terrible communication skills, worst teacher ever, select a different teacher!!!!"
8070,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH154,1.0,5.0,She was the worst professor I have had . She makes things easy in the middle of class but after that she gives you very hard time . She is crazy in her talking . Never recommended. She give me F because we had a group chat for class .
8071,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,2.0,2.0,"Very disorganized. Took about 6 days to respond to my emails. Homework and tests are on Pearson. She plays pre-made Pearson videos for her lectures, so you need to teach yourself. Her grading system is problematic and confusing. Only reason I got an A is because my anxiety of getting a B. Can come off condescending at times. Shes nice though."
8072,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,1.0,1.0,Not a lot to say about Mrs. Roberts other than she was very nice and funny. Good luck getting her to reply to your emails as she isnt much educated in technology. Very unorganized and doesnt really teach the material at all. I managed to carry a D all the way until the end when she miraculousy passed me with a B+. Awful Professor
8073,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH162,1.0,3.0,"Professor Roberts gets off topic very easily. She is funny and nice, but disorganized. I took her for the spring semester and it was really hard following through because she did everything on MML. She gave ALOT of homework and videos to watch."
8074,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH162,1.0,4.0,Prof Roberts really cares about her students but she does not know how to teach. The only reason I got a good grade is bc I took pre calc in hs. MML adds a lot of busy work and she copies right from the textbook. She tries but if you need a teacher to have organized notes and is able to answer questions and reply to emails she is just not it.
8075,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH162,1.0,4.0,"MML makes up a large portion of the course. When it comes to inclass notes it is only surfact level. However, there are 6 sections one needs to prepare for on the test, but she only tests you on the first two sections I understand we also had to deal with COVID but we spent one week before an exam just trying to explain to her how to post on canvas"
8076,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,3.0,2.0,"Mrs. Roberts is very sweet. She cares about her students and wants them to do well in the class. It was hard for me to get a hold of her with emails once we had to go online, but thats because technology isnt her strong suit. You will either love her class or dislike it. Do the homework, show up, and participate. You will pass if you do those!"
8077,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH162,3.0,4.0,"There is a test for every chapter and homework on mml. You will have to teach yourself many things. She is not the most organized person, but she tries her best. She is no good with technology, so don't take her remotely. She is a nice person and really brightens up your day, but she is not the best teacher and talks really fast."
8078,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH162,3.0,4.0,"She cares. If I had questions or didn't understand anything, I just went to her office hours and she explained things to me. But it got harder when we changed to remote classes because of COVID-19. She doesn't know how to use technology. She often asked us to help her to do things on canvas and mml during classes. You will have to teach yourself."
8079,315195,Margaret,Roberts,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH162,1.0,4.0,"This class was so unorganized. I taught myself the whole semester through MyLabMath videos. Mrs. Roberts is a nice person, but don't take her class if you actually want to learn the material. The layout of the tests are confusing and hard to follow, and there is so much online homework."
8081,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,"The readings were plenty and tough, but she is an amazing lecturer so she makes the topics easier to understand. Exams are on lockdown browse, paragraph answer form, but open note, so take good notes! Attend class, listen to her, take notes, &amp; you'll be fine. She's very sweet, &amp; it was nice learning from someone who's passionate about the subject."
8082,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,She seemed nice at the start but she is so demanding and asked way to much of everyone. She had crazy reading assignments every class and if you miss one class good luck for the rest of the semester do yourself a favor and get out of her class.
8083,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,3.0,4.0,"I took this class first semester and it was one of the hardest classes I've ever taken. It is clear she knows what she's talking about, but her homework was too hard for me. She assigned multiple essays due at the end of the semester and no one in class knew how to write them. I took history again with another professor and got a much higher grade."
8084,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,Prof. Winters is an amazing lecturer. Although the class is online you still should attend since the attendance assignments (worth 35%) are only available at a specific time during class hours. 3 open-notes exams which honestly weren't hard if you did your readings and pay attention during lecture. There are 2 essays and extra credit (at the end).
8085,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Class is straight forward. Open note tests, loads of essay options, flexibility with essay due dates, loads of reading, and a focus on critical thinking not memorization. Engaging class and fun even at 8 am."
8086,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS111,1.0,4.0,Terrible teacher. I hated that class. She has an unnecessary attitude when she talks to you and is very rude. She expects way too much from her students in a level 1 class. Never taking her again and dont suggest anyone else to.
8087,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Dr Winters is the best professor at NoVA! Even with the switch to learning online, the class meetings are fun and engaging. She is super well organized which helps right now, and she's always available during office hours. I'll take HIS 102 with her next semester!!!"
8088,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,"If you want to fail history she is a great professor, after midterm half, the class drops out, it's for a reason."
8089,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS112,1.0,2.0,"Professor Winters is very condescending and lacks the basic human compassion that would be assumed everyone is born with. I have sat in class and pondered if she has the goal to make the students lives harder. Lacks zero understanding that her students most likely are only taking this class for credit, and have other classes in their schedules."
8090,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,1.0,"The class is easy, but to avoid the extreme anger that she causes I would suggest to avoid her as a whole. She seeks to make student's lives harder, to validate herself. Her professional behavior is atrocious. Avoid at all costs."
8091,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,5.0,"Prof Winters gives AMAZING lectures, but the workload is TOUGH. As of Spring 2019, she had a system where she offers students lots of essay topics to write about (say 1200pts worth) and you can pick which essays to do until you total up to 300. If you do poorly on one essay, you can just write some more to get to 300, but don't miss the due dates!"
8092,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,2.0,5.0,Very interesting women with a vast knowledge of history but her class was very hard for a 100 level. Makes you do papers that you have no clue how to. A pre rec is English 111 and there you only learn Mla so how are students expected to already know how todo Chicago style. Lecture is shaped around what the students want to learn so thats neat.
8093,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS111,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Winters assigns a lot of homework for a hybrid class, but it's easy discussion board work. There are three small essays and two long essays, and those are hard, but she will help you if you visit her at the office. I did bad on the first one, but it was alot easier after that. The best part of class is when she lectures. Group work is okay."
8094,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher, if you put in the effort you will get an A. Enjoyed every minute of her class."
8095,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,2.0,Great professor! She gives lots of chances to make up points if you mess up an essay.
8096,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,4.0,"This class is not a easy A. Its a fun A. You will learn a lot and pay attention because of her excitement in the classroom. She requires you to read before coming into class but its not hard. She quizzes you on the reading, so you have to do it. She been one of my favorite teachers so far."
8097,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Best professor at NOVA! I learned more in this class than any other class in my two years here. There's alot of reading and writing, but if you do the work you'll pass. She's really nice and helpful and funny."
8098,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,1.0,5.0,"Very nice,but the worst grader ever, please don't take her , she does to many essays and to many quizzes. Exams are open note but if you state the point of the question and don't give her what she wants she will give you are fat zero."
8099,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS101,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Winters is a great professor. She will not cut you slack if you don't show up unannounced (most of my class who stopped showing up started to fail) It is alot of reading but everything you do is open notes. She does knowledge checks and requires you to do up to 300points worth of essays. She is a reasonable professor, dont take her for granted."
8100,1838474,Jennifer,Winters,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),History,HIS111,1.0,4.0,"I was disappointed in this class. Prof. winters assigns A LOT of homework and are due random days throughout the week, sometimes at 11:59pm and other times randomly which can make things confusing. Learn everything at home by reading the textbook. she didn't lecture. Quizzes at beginning of class so that if you are 5 minutes late you get a zero."
8102,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC201,5.0,1.0,Professor P is the most elegant gem ever. Even the way she glides across the room when she lectures is interesting. She lectures in a very realistic way which helps you understand and has a love for accounting and she loves $. Take her in person! Homework is so little and tests are take home. TAKE HER. I switched to accounting after this class
8103,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC212,2.0,3.0,"I took an online Accounting II class with professor Panchal. She kindly helped me one time during the semester. Apart from that time, there was zero video meetings with the class, zero class interaction. I felt lonely during that class and wouldn't take it again."
8104,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,5.0,2.0,"After reading some of the newer reviews, I decided to take prof. Panchal. Her class was easy to pass and she has a clear grading criteria. Each week consisted of textbook reading, practice, then the homework. The quizzes, midterm and final were all taken online. From my experience, she was good with communicating with students. Taking 212 with her!"
8105,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211AND212,5.0,1.0,"Despite her lower score on here her class is very easy to pass. Homework, midterm, and finals are all done online. Attendance is taken every class and is graded. She's also lenient about due dates. All in all she is a great professor!"
8106,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC212,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed her class very much. I took her for both ACC 211 and 212. Accounting is very challenging, but she lectures in a way that helps you comprehend the material. She points out what will be on tests, and guides you in a fashion that if you pay attention and take notes you will pass with a good grade. Make sure to do all HW as well."
8107,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211AND212,5.0,1.0,I like this professor and her teaching style. she does not rush you when it comes to handing in assignments. I wish every teacher was like her. she is so helpful and really caring towards her students. she grades quickly and gives good feedback plus extra credit. I took her class online 8 wks and she is the best professor. she is patient &amp; easy.
8108,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,4.0,2.0,"Had Panchal for ACC 211. She can get off topic very easily in lectures, and is not the best at putting the problems in perspective. Sometimes it is hard to understand just what exactly we are doing. Assignments are straightforward, exams are either online or open book, and there is a grade bump for perfect attendance. Boring class, but an easy A."
8109,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,4.0,3.0,"She is a very laid back, yet talkative kind of professor. Every lecture starts with her making an attempt to get to know her students but turns out hilariously awkward at times. At least for intro to accounting all of her homework is online and gives you almost a month to get it done. The exams are super easy and online."
8110,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,4.0,3.0,"As long as you come to class and get online hw done on time, you will pass the class. If you need help with something, go to her office, she will help you. Overall, the class is not stressful if you know what you are doing and she is a pretty cool professor."
8111,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,4.0,1.0,Professor Panchal's class is extremely easy and the exams are online and open note. I feel that she didn't cover all topics though. She gives 5 points for every class you attend. Online homework is a piece of cake. Cool person overall.
8112,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,5.0,3.0,"She has made the class so easy for me, except for the exams. Everything that you do in the class is given in the videos, but the exams are extremely tough and you would have to study very hard for them in order get a good grade."
8113,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,5.0,4.0,She has good lectures and explains the concepts in real life accounting situations. I think the notes I took in her class will be useful for my first internship or job
8114,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,5.0,1.0,"Easy class, real good prof and easy ""A""..."
8115,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,5.0,2.0,Interesting lectures. Learned a lot. Easy and clear grading.
8116,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC212,3.0,4.0,She can be rather funny but is a difficult teacher. She will teach you the basics and then kind of kick you off the edge and tell you to figure out the harder versions. The homework given is short and an easy A. The tests are rather hard but everything is online and open note.
8117,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC221,1.0,4.0,"Be prepared to learn on your own.  She's very easily drawn off topic in class and obviously doesn't read her students well.  If you tell her you don't understand something it's met with a defensive ""why not?""   Very frustrating semester.  The only plus is that all quizzes and exams are taken at home.  I don't feel prepared to move on to ACC222."
8118,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,4.0,2.0,She is good about answering questions in class. She isn't so great about responding to emails. Be sure to take good notes.
8119,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,1.0,5.0,Yuck! Shes not nice and not willing to help her online students. DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE IF ITS UR FIRST TIME TAKING ACCOUNTING!!
8120,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,5.0,1.0,I am currently taking this class. Really great accounting professor. Very knowledgeable and good teacher. Attend the classes and ask questions if you don't understand. She is very helpful. I started loving accounting because of this class.
8121,812417,Rujuta,Panchal,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC211,5.0,2.0,Good class
8123,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC211,5.0,3.0,"Definitely take her! She cares about her students and their success. A little tough, but will literally tell you the exact content on the exam before you take it."
8124,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,3.0,Best Professor I have ever taken at NOVA. I took her three times for all of my SOC classes.
8125,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, MAKE SURE to turn the homework in on time, does not accept late work. 1 EXAM which is the final but she lets you know what to study. Heavy heavy note taking so make sure to show up to class. Overall great professor"
8126,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,3.0,1.0,"At first was iffy, but sit in the front &amp; you're guaranteed to get the grade you deserve, only used one book though... only one exam, which is the final &amp; she tells you the terms to study Very easy class, just show up and try to laugh at her ""jokes"" to make her like you"
8127,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,2.0,2.0,"final grade is the average of 4 exams, and thats it, no other grades. She gives a study guide before each exam with the exact terms that will be one there, which come directly from your notes. She doesn't post powerpoint on blackboard so come to every class! The only thing i don't like is that she lies about her life which is really weird. Easy A!"
8128,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC207,5.0,3.0,"The hw is easy, but make sure you turn it in on time because she absolutely does NOT accept any late work. So just stay on top of your game and you'll be fine. She has really interesting stories, kinda intimidating at first but she's cool. No phones allowed in class, but she's really entertaining you def wont be bored."
8129,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Minnich makes lectures super interesting &amp; entertaining. I took her in 5-weeks so note taking was very important. That is where you find the answers for study guides. Tests are a bit hard since there's short answer &amp; fill in th blank, memorization is very important. Be on time! There are BB assignments that are there for a certain amt of time."
8130,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC202,4.0,2.0,"She's a cool lady that usually gives us exactly what to study, which really helps us on our tests. Our only grades are our 4 tests so be sure that you do well on those or you won't do well in the class."
8131,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC202,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Minnich is AWESOME. 4 total tests and she gives you everything for the test. Totally hilarious, she looks like Meryl Streep but shorter with the personality of Ellen. You can't have your phone out during class, she makes that rule very clear. Do not come late, she will not let you sign in, and she does not post on blackboard, so get a #."
8132,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,2.0,"Scary as hell, but pretty cool. Write everything on the PPs down, she gives you study guides that are the exact exams, &amp; your notes are going to be the EXACT answers. Don't skip, you won't get the notes anywhere else. She's done some pretty awesome stuff, don't be afraid to ask her about it in class, altho she has certain things she won't answer."
8133,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Super outgoing, gives study guides which is GREAT! Study and you'll pass with an A. Loves to interact with students."
8134,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,2.0,"For my class I didn't use my textbook but buy it or rent it just in case. She is one of the best teachers I've met in my whole entire life. She can be tough but always fair and she will talk what will be on the test beforehand. TAKE NOTES it will be crucial for your tests. NEVER underestimate her, she is a great person and deserves respect."
8135,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,4.0,1.0,"She is super funny, however never have a single electronic out in front of her because I got yelled at and she'll tell you to get out of the class(luckily that didn't happen to me(yet)). She does grab your attention and this is my focus area. No extra credit, but you probably won't need it."
8136,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC201,5.0,1.0,"The reviews for the exams are the exact same as the  exams . Make sure you take notes in class they are the answers to your exam review questions. Don't be late to class points will be deducted. Make sure you do assignments, they are an easy A."
8137,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC202207,5.0,1.0,"One of the best professors I've ever had at NVCC. She uses life experiences as examples to help the material stick better. Both times I had her as my professor, she would usually just go on to say exactly what was on the exam and that the topics she mentioned would be there verbatim. She likes engaging students with discussions as well as boosts"
8138,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,4.5,1.0,"Professor Minnich is an extremely interesting teacher. Her life stories are amazing. There were only 4 exams. No assignments what so ever. She gives you study guides and it is basically the exam so study them! Never miss class because every time you do, you get 3 points off of your final. Easy A class if you show up and study for the exams."
8139,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC268,5.0,2.0,"Overall great professor. Full of interesting life stories. Everything from interviews with serial killers and presidents to friendships with music legends. Generally: 2 exams, a paper of around 10 pages, and reading assignments throughout the semester. A definitive must take for anyone interested in sociology or a fascinating professor."
8140,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC200,4.0,3.0,Skip the book. Interesting life stories. MUST ATTEND AND BE ON TIME! Gives you the questions that will be asked on tests. All T/F questions are ALWAYS TRUE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
8141,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC268,5.0,1.0,All i can say is i love her! Yes we had assignment due every class but nothing crazy. Class discussions were awesome and really helped me understand the course!
8142,1095146,Donna,Minnich,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Sociology,268,5.0,3.0,I loved her so much I took three classes. She's straight forward and the best professor I've ever had: 201 three tests that she gave study guides for 268 10 page paper BUT you can choose your topic. I HATE papers but it really wasn't bad 207 10 page paper but you can choose your topic and it was doable. A study guide for the final was given
8144,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,1.0,5.0,"do not taje his class because of the test if, you guys cant be carful make a little mistake that other teacher dont even count it as a mistake he will take half point im telling yall save your grade. idc how good he is he ruined my grades and GPA. I hope one day in his life he can feel what I felt he literally made me fail for it."
8145,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,1.0,5.0,"IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR GRADE/GPA DON'T TAKE HIM!!!! HE IS GOOD TEACHING AND EXPLANING, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TEST YOU WILL REGRET YOU HAVE HIM. I LITRALLY HAD ONE WRONG IN MY TEST BUT I GOT C IN THE TESTB BECUSE THE PROFFESOR WILL TAKE GRADES FOR A FEW MISTAKES. IM GREAT AT MATH BUT COULDN'T PASS THE TEST BECUASE OF HIM. I LITRALLY CRY MY EYES OUT"
8146,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,1.0,5.0,"Considering we are amidst a pandemic you would think professors would be more understanding, however he gave copious amounts of work, even telling us that it would take us at least 6 hours to do 10 questions and if we spend less time than that, we're doing it wrong. Not much time to do our exams, many people ended up dropping the course."
8147,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,3.0,4.0,"His lectures are easy to follow and understandable. However, he gives out a lot of homework. Which can be tough because some of the sections aren't even covered on the exam. Also, he only gives you around an hour and 20 minutes to complete the exam. Keep that in mind!"
8148,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH264,5.0,3.0,"I passed calc1 with a low B &amp; I was terrified of taking calc2, but prof Wahl changed my view of mathematics. I took an online course &amp; his lectures were amazing, the key is to take good noted &amp; go over each problem on the homework. He loves questions from students &amp; offers student hours. Focus on ch11&amp;10 its very diff. from what you learned before"
8149,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH263,4.0,4.0,"In this course, you learn Limits and Derivatives, Differentiation Rules, Application of Differentiation, Integrals, and Applications of Integration. Total 5 chapters and he gives almost 100 questions solution for homework and you need to write those solutions on a paper. It makes lot of things hard. However, his teaching is very good."
8150,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,5.0,4.0,"Not an easy A but one of the best professors at Nova, tough but I learned more in prof wahl's class than any other class"
8151,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH167,5.0,3.0,Very good lectures. Clearly cares about his students. Showing up to class and doing the online homework is very important.
8152,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH161,5.0,3.0,"He is a very good teacher in my opinion. Your HW is online and there's no need to use the textbook. It was easy for me to understand his lectures and the homework online. There are only four test, including the final and he drops the worst grade. I skipped a few classes which hurt my grade and was probably the reason why I didn't get an A haha."
8153,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH163,5.0,2.0,"He is by far one of the funniest professors I have had. his tests are easy, but he is a bit harsh when it comes to grading. you need to label your axis and round your numbers according to directions and if it's a word problem you should finish your answer with a word. Definitely would recommend him."
8154,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH163,1.0,2.0,do not take class with him if you want a good grade!! i took precal 1 with other professor i got 97 out of 100 all the time but with him i got 60-70 even though i couldnt do only 2 questions!
8155,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT153,2.0,5.0,"Unless you are very good at math, do not take him. Half of the class dropped out."
8156,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH163,1.0,4.0,He is the toughest grader I have ever seen when it comes to tests. He takes off points for literally not rounding the nearest 100 or 10. Also takes points off for not labeling x and Y axis.
8157,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH174,5.0,4.0,"He is just amazing. Im so in love with his teaching method. IF YOU WANT KNOW MATH, JUST TAKE HIM."
8158,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH151,1.0,3.0,"Assigns copious amounts of homework, class moves extremely quickly and tests are truly the main thing that matters. He is smart and funny, but not a very empathic individual if you require assistance. I honestly would not suggest him due to my experience, but if you are comfortable in Math, he may work for you. If you are not, please get tutoring!"
8159,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH173MATH174,4.0,3.0,"Professor Wahl is great and you should pick him up as soon as possible. He is very clear for what he looks/grades for on exams. Professor Wahl does assign a lot of homework, but that is honestly your best source to prepare for his exams, plus he grades on completion. As a heads-up his finals are harder than the exams, but nothing over the top."
8160,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH174,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Wahl provides explicit(clear) explanation of concepts. The Fact is whoever you choose, you won't be able to avoid a certain amount of HW/math problems to pass anyway. Take HIS class. And Enjoy the magic (of) math instead of the magic kingdom there."
8161,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH173,4.0,4.0,"Calculus isn't supposed to be easy, about half the class would fail each of the tests but your lowest test grade gets dropped (not your final, though). If you go to class and are an active listener there's no reason you shouldn't pass. There is a lot of homework but it's all practice for the tests. If you don't understand something ASK HIM!"
8162,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH174,3.0,5.0,"Save your GPA. Stay away from him. He is the pickiest grader I have ever seen. Though his lectures are good, exams are nightmare."
8163,345024,Bruce,Wahl,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Mathematics,MTH277,4.0,4.0,"Professor Wahl doesn't hold himself up to a pedestal like most professors do. He cares about students opinions, which is why he reads these posts. He does give 2 EC opportunities. His lectures aren't that boring (it's math, what can you expect?), tests are based off of HW questions. HW questions are graded by completeness. Drops lowest test grade!"
8164,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM212,1.0,5.0,"First day of class I took the only seat left. Maybe 35 people. I dropped on the last day I could without penalty. Only 8 of us left in the class. His tests are very difficult. I quote ""This is a Chemistry class. There is no reason you should not know everything there is to know about Chemistry when were done"""
8165,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,2.5,5.0,"Condescending indeed. I mentioned having to miss class to fight a parking ticket (I was ticketed during non-enforced hours, yes I'm going to fight it) he made rude remarks about me being irresponsible. However, I won't deny that he's brilliant. His lectures consist of materials beyond the textbook, so he is great if you're serious about chemistry "
8166,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM111,3.5,5.0,"Most challenging class I have ever taken.  Yes, chemistry is hard, but actually passing this class still makes me feel great 10 years later.  I have never studied so hard in my life!"
8167,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM013,4.0,4.0,This professor is no joke. Only recommended for those with a strong math or science background. study hard if you wish to get a good grade. if you attend all of his lectures and do all of the homework you will probably do well. Be sure to take advantage of his immense knowledge.  An A is possible; don't listen to the haters that didn't study hard
8168,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,1.5,5.0,The man is so overwelingly intelligent on the subject of chemistry that it causes some makeshift barrier between him and his students. Stupid questions get stupid responses. He is avaialabe usually be it always seemed to me that he wanted me to correct my life and academic self before I try and learned chemistry. Not worth your time or grade.
8169,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM111,1.0,5.0,Worst Professor I have ever had in my entire life. Not helpful whatsoever and very demeaning and condescending.  I am an A student and I had to work very hard to get a C in the class. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER!!!!! The adviser told me not to take this class but I wanted to get it out of the way because I usually enjoy taking a science class.
8170,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM111,1.0,5.0,Extremely boring and not a good teacher. Gets frustrated when somebody needs help.

Retook chem and got a B. In semester 2, I got an A. Took organic chemistry and received As. If you're premed he will teach you how to study. That's the whole point :)"

8174,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,1.0,5.0,RUN!! Find another professor! This one is awful and will gladly fail his entire class just to stroke his own ego.
8175,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,1.0,5.0,"I have gone through all the negative comments on this site about Dr. Stanclift and I have to admit every single one of them are correct. This professor does not care if he fails every single one of his students. He is impatient, intolerant, and unconcerned with the needs of his students! Find another professor because this one is a nightmare!"
8176,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,5.0,4.0,"He is just awesome! I transferred to GMU this fall, but I miss him every day! I wish I could take 112 with him!"

I hate people that complain that their teacher is hard and stupid because he actually makes them study! Dr. Stanclift is like the smartest professor I have ever met! He knows everything about chemistry. If you need some help he is always available! Glad to know him:)"
8181,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM112,1.0,5.0,he tries to confuse students by discussing things which are not related to chemistry or above the scope of this course(just to make you feel stupid).Expect to be humiliated too.
8182,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM112,2.0,5.0,"Professor is ridiculously hard. I took CHM 111 &amp; 112 from him, I regret not switching out. If you want a good grade, don't take this professor. If you want to be treated like a professional chemist and get a grade that doesn't reflect the effort you put into his class, this is the professor for you."
8183,186052,William,Stanclift,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,2.5,5.0,"The class Started with 28 Students. anyone who stood a fighting chance at an A was smart enough to swap. After the final drop deadline all that remained were us. We were the foolish 7. He tests on his lectures, and throws curve balls. He expects you to KNOW Physics and Calculus. If you are great with Math you can survive... with a C."
8185,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG112,5.0,2.0,"I really like this professor. In ENG 112 there are 4 essays, a midterm, and a final exam. The 4 essays you have the whole semester to work on and he revises your drafts before you submit the final essay, so you're basically guaranteed an A if you listen to his advice. His classes are really engaging and funny, &amp; challenging but not too challenging"
8186,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,2.0,3.0,"I think the entire 16 weeks we went over the same 55 slide power-point pf the same thing re-worded. Felt more like a philosophy class then anything. Learned nothing, huge waste of time. Passed but would not recommend."
8187,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111ENG112,5.0,2.0,"Professor Clarke is so loved by his students, and I can see why. He's kind and helpful. His lectures are funny but you don't really need to pay attention. Journals were easy and you had the whole semester to do them. 2 exams were even easier (open note, take home). Gave easy EC. Just do your 4 essays and he'll help you out every step of the way."
8188,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,4.0,3.0,"Professor Clarke clearly cares about his students as people. That being said, his lectures can be confusing if you don't put in outside work to apply them to your writing. Towards the end of the semester, everything he had been talking about fell into place for me but I spent the first half of the semester confused about his expectations."
8189,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,I learned a lot from my class with professor Clarke. He stands as my favorite professor so far and I am fully intending on taking another of his classes. Passing his class isn't that difficult but you have to put in effort. If you wait till the last second to do assignments you're going to have a hard time. But his classes are worth the work.
8190,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,4.0,"Professor Clarke is great. I thought I was gonna fail the class, but ended with an A. As long as you so up and put in the effort into your essays, you're guaranteed an A. He gives back feedback on the essays and some extra credit opportunities."

8192,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111112,4.0,3.0,I took Prof Clarke for 111 and 112. He is really caring and hilarious. He loves to challenge his students and really makes you think. He does give out pop quizzes. Beware of journals! Make sure to number them! There are 2 exams (open book/note) and 4 major essays! Just make sure to ask him for help! He gives great feedback!
8193,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Clarke is a phenomenal professor. He really enjoys teaching and loves being able to help his students through the class if they are struggling. You are only graded on 2 exams and 4 essays, which are all very easy and all have a very easy to follow rubric to know how to get an easy A. Follow the process he gives and you will for sure get an A."
8194,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG112,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Clarke, is a very caring professor towards his students who show him the effort in his class.

Overall an awesome professor!"
8195,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,2.0,"For ENG111 he had four major essays, and a mid-term and final (both were easy and open note). He basically gives the entire semester to work on the essays, so unless you wait until the last week there's no reason why you wouldn't have them done. He's, fun, helpful, and his lectures can be really funny. I'm signing up for his ENG112 class. :D"

Be wary though, as he will entirely re-teach you how to write an essay, but I promise it will help you out so much in the long run. Overall, his lectures are engaging and funny to boot. You can always find him available during office hours as well!"
8200,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,2.0,"Clarke is amazing. People who write bad reviews about him Clarke are either dumb or just don't care about class and expect you to give them an A for no reason. Take Clarke, he is the best teacher in NOVA!!!"
8201,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,Teaches great and helps you with the assignments. Not very clear on what is expected at first but after a while he explained and everything clicked.
8202,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,4.0,I loved his lecture and he truly cared for his students. However his assignments (4 Analytical Essays) were very confusing to me especially trying to find sources for them. He takes a while to respond to emails &amp;grade but hes always available during office hours. I wish went more because I probably wouldve understood the assignment more
8203,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,2.0,I learned a lot more about writing in this class than in almost every lit class I've taken so far combined. He wants all of his students to succeed. You will love his class if you stay caught up cause he won't chase after you to turn in your work.
8204,1338126,Stephen,Clarke,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),English,ENG111,5.0,3.0,"Professor Clarke is super amazing and caring. He's very accessible outside of class. I suggest going to see him at least once a week to check in with him if you have any questions about papers or your grade, he'll guide you in the right direction. Only thing I didn't like about his class were the essays, hard to follow a bit."
8205,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,1.0,4.0,"She is a nice person but a really bad teacher. She gets rude at times during  labs, and overall does not know how to teach. She know what she is talking about, but her way of teaching is awful."
8206,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM111,4.0,4.0,"I'm surprised at the ratings this professor has. I find her to be extremely passionate about teaching and really interested in student's progress.

8207,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM112,1.0,4.0,"I'll admit that she's intelligent and passionate about teaching chemistry. However, she is extremely rude and tried to humiliate me in front of class. I made a small mistake in lab and she asked me and my lab partner if we did not know how to read and asked us to read out loud the label on this bottle of chem solution we were using for the lab."
8208,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111112,2.0,3.0,"Despite her extremely high voice, she still manages to be one of the most boring professors I've had. Get ready to take annoying breaks from note-taking as she will stop and say something about how what she is saying is right (is she telling us or herself?). Also a the more heavily-graded quizzes are online. Might as well be a hybrid course."
8209,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM112,3.0,4.0,"I took her for chem 112 online over the summer. This was a 7 week course that was so much in such a small amount of time. As our only communication was via email, she took a very long time to respond and when she did it was almost like she never read it and she is only available wends. The tests were difficult. Don't take chemistry online!"

I got a B in the class, but almost failed because my quiz average was below 60. The fact that I didn't, however, means that she does value learning over strict rules. The tests don't really reflect the quizzes very much, but they're not terribly difficult. I took CHM 111 with her. Just don't miss a lab or quiz and you're good."
8211,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,1.0,5.0,"She may be great in-person, but is the worse online teacher I've ever had. Quizzes and tests didn't reflect the readingstudy material. She took 3+ days to email  back (&amp; offers nothing more than ""study the chapter); she took weeks to return scores. She  expects 30+ hours a week studying. More than half our class dropped. Avoid if at all possible."
8212,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,101,3.0,4.0,She usually not answers emails right away and takes forever to post the score from the tests.

8213,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111CHM112,5.0,3.0,She is a great teacher but she is not easy.  You will need to put in the work.  She does give a couple of extra credit assignments.  There are a lot of in class and online quizzes.  You will have to work for an A but you will appreciate how much chemistry you know after it is all said and done.  She is really inspirational.
8214,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111007N,5.0,3.0,She demands so much work from students but at the same time she is very helpful and if you do whatever she wants you too you will get a good grade in her class. Students usually dont like her because they dont know how to deal with her. She is very helpful and responds to ur emails ASAP. I recommend her strongly if u want to learn.

She doesn't want you reading from the txtbook while she lectures, then next minute expects you to whip out the book and read from it. Has high expectations; read material ahead of time. If you don't get the material learned that class period by the next class, she gets cranky. Also talks too much. *EXPECT A QUIZ EVERY CLASS."

She often nudges at her prior successes in order to ""prove"" how qualified she is as a teacher and scientist. Expect an enormous amount of repetition in both routine and lecture. High pitched accent is somewhat bearable (3 hour lectures)"

8219,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM112,3.0,5.0,"A good teacher, but also crazy. She told us that she expects ""40 hours plus"" studying at home and has a quiz every class as well as some quizzes online. If you are caught cheating, she fails you for the entire course no matter what. Using anything on your calculator besides basic functions is cheating (i.e. no temp. converter on calc etc)"
8220,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM122,4.0,3.0,"Took her online. I got full points for all the labs I turned in. The quizzes are taken on computer. Pretty nice b/c u get two tries for the quiz, so if u didn't u do well on ur first one, u can still make up for it. Best thing about her is that she let's u drop ur lowest test grade. So, u can skip a test if did well on the others."
8221,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM112,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Savkar is a great professor. She is like a mom as said before. She is always behind students so that they can do their best. Is a really tough class,but she is always there to help."
8222,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM111,4.5,3.0,"Professor Savkar gives you every opportunity to succeed and get a high mark. She expects a lot out of you on the exams, but nothing more than I would say is appropriate for this type of  class. Follow her instructions on how much to study, study hard, take advantage of extra credit, and ask her questions when you need to do so."
8223,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM101,1.0,3.0,I took her online course.  I emailed and posted to blackboard and still had no reply to my questions weeks later.  I also know that other students had this difficulty as well.
8224,186044,Reva,Savkar,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM112,4.5,4.0,"Prof. Savkar, is a great professor that likes her students to learn. She is like a mom behind everyone. She is happy when her students succeed and try. If you go for help individually, and she sees the effort that you are doing, she considers that a lot for participation points."
8226,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,5.0,3.0,"He is a really good teacher and wants his students to really learn and understand the material. The class is powerpoint based, so you just have to take notes on that and key things he says. Only 4 tests which make up your grade (plus labs) and the lowest test is dropped. Don't buy the textbook; it's not needed. I would very much recommend him"
8227,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,1.0,5.0,PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR do not take him unless you have an amazing memory. He should teach history instead of bio to be honest. He is a good person.
8228,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,1.0,4.0,"Please do yourself a favor and stray far away from Professor Goolsby. You'll ruin your GPA by taking him. He was mildly accommodating, but in the end he will not respond to calls, voicemails, or even emails. He will lie about your grade til the last second and then not respond. He's a nice person, but a horrible professor, best of luck to you."
8229,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,4.0,4.0,"He is a nice guy but not a good professor. He really cares about his students and will stay after if you have questions. He lectures off a powerpoint that only has pictures and no descriptions if you take this class MAKE SURE YOU TAKE NOTES, don't skip labs and don't skip class you will miss a lot of info. Also there are no study guides. Good luck!"
8230,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,5.0,3.0,I'm a fan. We called him Coolsby because he was so cool. You DO have to work in the class but it's not overwhelming.
8231,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,1.0,4.0,"Nice Guy but not a great professor. His test are so hard, doesn't post anything on blackboard, no study guide. He has powerpoints that he teaches off of but those powerpoints are all pictures. I had to read the text book to understand the material. Only take this class if your'e super good at bio."
8232,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,3.0,5.0,"Take him if you're really into science... I'm serious. Or if you so happen to magically remember everything from your past high school science classes. Or if you have a photographic memory and like to stare at pictures instead of dealing with an actual powerpoint with words then he's the guy for you. Don't get me wrong, he says he's here to help."
8233,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,3.0,3.0,"Goolsby tries his best, but it's difficult to cover so much material in such limited time. His class is only lectures and exams, so if you fail the exams, you're screwed. He goes off on tangents a lot which can be distracting and he's more interested in discussing examples of material than covering it well. He's also pretty unorganized."
8234,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,5.0,2.0,His lectures are fascinating and you can tell hes really passionate about the subject matter. This man will inspire you.
8235,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,5.0,4.0,"The bottom line is that biology is a complex subject filled with various concepts and lots of specific subject matter. With that being said there is no teacher at nova that teaches biology easily. Mr. Goolsby is completely understanding, extremely caring, passionate, very funny, &amp; really tries. His class is a bit difficult but it's worth it. TRY!"
8236,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,3.0,3.0,"He is a very enthusiastic professor with a good attitude, however, coming from a student who has already passed anatomy 1,2 and microbiology with A's with tough teachers, I was very surprised when I finished his ""Easy A"" class with a C. I got at least a B on every test too???. I would not take his class if you're a beginner in the science field."
8237,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,3.0,5.0,"Mr. Goolsby is a cool guy, has a lot of jokes,  energy and smarts. His class is NOT as easy-going as he is though. He has 0 notes for you to take, and tends to ramble on about difficult concepts. If you aren't good at BIO already, prepare to study and absolutely challenge yourself. Tests are hard, lab quizzes are OK. Not my preferred teaching style"
8238,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO102,4.0,2.0,"Don't wanna beat a dead horse, but Goolsby is a very enthusiastic educator. 4 tests, lowest is dropped. Doesn't give back tests unless you go in office hours. Labs/tests are unbelievably straightforward (3 100s). 18 extra credit points (4 on exam 1, 10 exam 2, 4 exam 3). Notes don't have to be too detailed, as the tests don't go in depth tbh..."
8239,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,2.0,5.0,He is a nice and funny professor but he just lectures a lot off of his power points. He is not an easy A professor. So don't take him expecting that. He does not really grade attendance that much but don't miss his labs. He grades those. You WILL NEVER USE THE TEXTBOOK!. So don't waste $150 but you will need the $20 lab book. Hard Tester.
8240,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,2.0,4.0,He is a really friendly and goofy guy but he is not ideal for an introduction course. Had I not already had taken a biology course recently I would have struggled a lot. He goes into specifics of intricate concepts but leaves out core concepts that should be taught in Bio 101. His powerpoints lack substance and he goes on long irrelevant tangents.
8241,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,4.0,3.0,"Goolsby is a nice guy at heart. one of the kindest professors at nova. He gives you the most respect possible. His grading scale is very test heavy, there is no extra credit what so ever. tests are hard. you have to read the book and understand if u wanna pass. Overall nice guy uses powerpoints but with no notes. most lectures come from his mouth."
8242,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,3.0,4.0,He is a really funny teacher. He's not intimidating or  mean but I didn't like his style of teaching. His study guides were very vague and it was difficult for me to study. I have never passed a biology class before in my life and I somehow managed to get a C in his class but it wasn't without effort. His powerpoint don't have any notes
8243,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,5.0,2.0,"Well Professor Goolsby is literally the best teacher I've ever had. First, he is passionate. He gives amazing speeches, which are easy to follow and interesting as well. He is accessible outside class like 4 days a week. He cares about his students and tries to be helpful every time I looked for help. Go ahead and take his classes. You won't regret"
8244,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,4.0,3.0,"Mr. Goolsby is a very approachable funny sir. I took the one day a week class, so I had lecture and lab the same day, please don't do that for your sake. His style of teaching is talking. IF you pay attention, you will pass class. He requieres a textbook but his exams are based on what he talks about, so I never use it. Study for the lab quizzes."
8245,898286,Kirk,Goolsby,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Health Science,BIO101,5.0,4.0,"he is an amazing professor! explains stuff well, answers all your ?'s, drops the final exam, has study guides on his website, and has amazing stories that help you understand what we're talking about. he's funny,  energetic,  &amp; super helpful. i love his lectures!! bio is difficult to teach so of course bio is going to be hard. so dont be lazy&amp;STUDY"
8247,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM101,1.0,5.0,"He doesn't explain very well. he's so caught up on the details that he misses The main point of what we're learning. It might be clear to him but, students we're learning the subject which Makes it harder when you have so many details to focus on. He's not understanding, Mainly thinks that chemistry is the only class ur taking in that semester"
8248,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM102,3.0,3.0,"Mr. Obrien is really nice, but he's not direct when you ask questions. The only grades for this class were the labs &amp; the tests. All the quizzes are bonus points that he adds to the tests later and you get an optional project to replace the lowest test grade. Just show up to class on time, do all the labs and use the study questions &amp; you'll pass."
8249,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM101,5.0,3.0,"Professor Obrien is a great professor with a great sense of humor.

8252,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CH101,5.0,2.0,Great guy. Funny. Easy A.
8253,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM102,2.0,5.0,"He does not help you to get a good solid grade. Please do not take him because his test only average up 50 questions each 5 tests, you're given not enough time, if you came late to class. Must study every second of your life to boost your GPA. Beware of Pop-quizzes because they can your life ( bonus points). Get Help from the science tutors."
8254,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM102,4.0,5.0,He is not the best but he knows his stuff. It was just hard material. He rambles on a bit but nothing major. Would recommend
8255,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM101,2.0,3.0,"I would not recommend taking this professor, i honestly didnt learn anything and had to teach myself. His lectures are long and boring. Did enjoy lab though."
8256,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,2.0,Just finished chem class with Prof Obrien. Class was easy and fun and we learned some chemistry. He goes over all the stuff you need for the test.
8257,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM101,3.0,3.0,"Would take the class again, he is the only one I can see teaching this at this campus. He is accessible during his office hours and gives extra credit points My advice is to do the homework, it's not required but he may use a few HW questions on the test/quiz. Get into his office hours or additional tutoring if needed."
8258,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,Prof. Obrien is a good teacher. He makes it easy to understand. You do have to study but he does his part. Class and lab are fun.
8259,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM101,1.0,3.0,"He was the rudest teacher ive ever seen in my life, this is the first bad review ive ever written on this website. avoid his class"
8260,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM101,3.0,4.0,"Chem isn't my strong suit and he's not really a good lecturer, pretty much have to teach yourself. test are based off the recommended questions but theres a lot. does give bonus quizzes to help your lecture grade. lab is easy."
8261,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM101,1.0,3.0,"Horrible teacher and person. Extremely frustrating to work with. His lectures make little to no sense and his explanations are pointless. I showed up to 4 classes this semester, failed two tests, did all of the homework assigned (not graded), and still passed with a B because lab saved my ass. I would never take him again."
8262,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM101,4.0,4.0,"Nice guy. Lectures can be monotonous but if you pay attention, he really is explaining well. Tests are harder than the practice tests, so beware. Study, do the practice problems in the book and youll do well. Labs are fun, tests are hard. Im an A student &amp; got a B in, but Chem isnt my thing. No complaints. He does his part. Do yours."
8263,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM101,4.0,3.0,"Great professor with a good sense of humor. Assigns homework for your benefit but doesn't collect it. Exams are fair, labs are fun. Gives ""surprise pop quizzes"" for extra credit often. Not too heavy on power point, uses it when needed. Read your textbook, do the practice questions, and you'll do fine. Would take him for any chemistry course."
8264,432467,Walter,Obrien,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM101,5.0,3.0,"He is super considerate and thought. He will reinforce the need to study, or practice. When class ends early he gives us the option to stay back and have group study or get his help. If you attend class and practice with the homework you should get an A. It not super easy but we should all do our part. He certainly do. Took class January/18"

Unfortunately, a few month ago he passed away. May his soul Rest In Peace."
8270,461141,Steven,Drasner,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,1.0,5.0,"He's gets mad when people pack up, even if class ends. He say questions like tons. Hes writes sloppy. Only one question on exams.  Hes makes everything hard, he say he can't make it easier. He's rude too. I always work hard,only wanted to try him. I  Withdraw, currently taking  it with someone else, I am doing fine. Don't take Steven Drasner. Avoid"
8271,461141,Steven,Drasner,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP120,5.0,4.0,"This is my second time taking class with Steve. He's amazing and excellent lecturer. He taught Java using black board and white chart, which I found way more efficiency than using computer. He assigned 3 programs and 4 exams. No homework. He's very touch at grading, but this will help you when advancing to 4 year college. Be prepare to work!"
8272,461141,Steven,Drasner,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITD256,4.0,4.0,"Very straight forward. Excellent at lecture.

He knows the material really well and his lectures are interesting and very clear. He does have little things that set him off like cell phones  but overall he's a nice guy. Just make sure you attend every class, take notes, and DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS! He's not at all an easy teacher but he's great at teaching."

8280,461141,Steven,Drasner,Northern Virginia Community College (all campuses),Computer Science,ITP100,2.0,4.0,absolutely the hardest professor I've taken this semester. Everything I learn from his lecture are half of the content and I have to learn the other half on my own from the old textbook. There are 3 exams and graded homeworks. He can be a harsh grader and take off 10-20 points for one error of pseudocode. I highly suggest taking different professor

8298,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,5.0,2.0,"probably the best professor in my whole semester, he lectures quite a bit but his powerpoints and study guides are pretty much the test answers. he drops the two lowest test grades out of the first 5 tests, and you get extra credit for attendance. do yourself a favor and sign up for his class ASAP"
8299,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,5.0,2.0,"Took this online. Easiest A I've ever earned. Class was 3 test, 1 quiz in each unit for chapter, &amp; discussions. The test come directly from his powerpoints &amp; sometimes he'll even post a review with the material that's covered on the test. Other info is on quizlet too. Great class to take for GPA booster. He grades quickly &amp; responds to email fast"
8300,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,5.0,3.0,"He is a great professor and gives really good study guides for the tests. Your grade is based solely on 6 tests, but he gives you plenty of extra credit at the end of the semester if you are not absent too frequently. He is easy to pass as long as you study and use the study guides."
8301,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BIO1011,5.0,3.0,"This teacher is really easy going. Responded to my emails within 24 hours. Is very clear and to the point. Really enjoyed taking her class. I would take her again. Test are pretty average, and are all multiple choice. If you study you will get a good grade."
8302,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,2.0,"Take this class! Professor Liang is a great professor who truly cares about his students. Take this class if you want to get an A in microbio and also have the chance to really learn the material . He gives extra credit, so as long as you do your work and the extra credit you will get an A."
8303,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,4.0,2.0,Professor Liang is a good professor his test are straight from the PowerPoint so it makes it super easy to pass his tests. He gives good extra credit so if your looking for an easy class to pass this is the one
8304,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,5.0,2.0,I took this class during the summer and it's super easy. Prof. Liang is a great professor. His exams are identical to the power points. I also love how he grades exams by the next hour after you take it so it's instant feedback. His lectures are super boring and dragged out but totally worth it because it is such an easy class!
8305,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! He lectures for the whole class time, but you only have to print out his power point slides and those are your notes you write with and use during his open book exams. He doesn't give a midterm or final, just 6 class exams and that's it. Just come to class and get the notes."
8306,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,1.0,Took this class online. It was very straight forward. You can't fail as long as you meet the deadlines and study the study guide for exams.
8307,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,2.0,Professor Liang is a sweetheart. He's the most adorable little professor you could have HOWEVER he's very monotone. Tests are HEAVY and LONG but they are open book open notes. If you print out the power points and write the answers to the Q&amp;A on the pp you'll pass easily. No homework to worry about. Easy A guys.
8308,1300955,Lee,Liang,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,4.0,2.0,He makes it clear to understand the review sheets before taking the tests since he tests are mostly derived from the review sheets. He makes microbiology easy to understand. It was an easy A.
8310,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,1.0,"He was great! Anytime someone had a question he took the time to make sure they understood him before he moved on, would definitely take him again. If you pay attention there's no way to not get an A."
8311,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,1.0,"Professor Butler is the best teacher I ever had. I hated math now, the way he teaches, he cares he helps, I become a math lover. He s so great. If someone has a math class to take and wants to understands and passes with a great grade, please do yourself the best gift ever, take Professor Butler."
8312,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,2.0,"He is amazing at explaining difficult math concepts, and is willing to answer any questions. However, you must put time and effort in his class since the tests are a big portion of your grade. The only other things graded are participation pts and hw pts, so be prepared to study if you want to pass with an A! No final if you average 85+! Take him!"
8313,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,3.0,2.0,Really nice guy &amp; you can tell he cares but MAN he dropped the ball when my class went online due to covid. little to no communication on his end. Hopefully he can get the hang of online format because I did enjoy his class prior to the switch.
8314,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,1.0,"Professor Butler is the BEST math teacher! He explains everything in detail and breaks it down. If you don't understand it, he takes the time to make sure you get it. As long as you show up to class and do the work you will pass with no problem. You will not regret taking his class."
8315,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1100,5.0,4.0,"I never really liked or understood math, thats why I always tend do bad. When I saw his reviews here I decided to take him, HE IS A GREAT, caring teaching who cares if you understand a problem, he will walk around engage with each individual he explain things very clear which makes me really understand math. AMAZING TAKE HIM 10 out of 10 teacher."
8316,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"The best math teacher I've ever had. He is consistently checking that you understand the material, helps after class, goes over complex material multiple times, and tells you exactly what needs to be studied and reviewed again. Too often I am met with teachers that lack any passion for their work or compassion for their students, he is exceptional."
8317,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,3.0,"Wow! Let me just say that I have never been good at math. That was until I took this class. Professor Butler is an amazing teacher and he makes sure every single person understands the lesson. He randomly collects homework so it's best to always have it done (and it helps for tests). Most of your grade is from tests but don't worry, he's awesome!"
8318,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,1.0,"Mr Butler is the best!!! His class was the only time I was truly confident in math. If you struggle and want a professor who would take their time to break things down step by step AND ACTUALLY TEACH YOU, you have to take his class. The homework is very easy and the tests are exactly what he teaches. Do your homework and I promise you'll pass."
8319,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,3.0,"Honestly the best teacher Ive EVER had. He is honestly the most caring teacher you will ever find. You can tell he loves his job. If you are ever confused on anything, Professor Butlers amazing responses will answer any of your questions. All you have to do is do your notes and study for the test and it is an A for sure"
8320,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1105,5.0,1.0,Professor Butler is by far the BEST Professor I have ever had. He is so incredible and nice. He explains every problem one by one and takes his time. I wish I could have him as my Math Professor every semester.
8321,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1100,5.0,3.0,"Prof Butler is very good! He gives AMAZING notes ,make sure to write down everything he puts on the board. Shows you step by step so you clearly understand the lesson. Answers all your questions. You do NOT need the book, as ALL the HW is on MyMathLab and he gives you all the notes you need! Would take him for every math class if I could!"
8322,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,2.0,"Best Professor! I was so bad at math and i'm honestly surprised at how much I improved by taking this class. He made everything clear and easy to understand, he will go over anything you do not understand and drops lowest test grade at the end of course. If you have a B or higher you won't have to take the final!!"
8323,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,Have no fear Butler is here. Great professor he really cares about his students and makes sure they all understand the material. If he taught College Algebra he would be my go too.
8324,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,3.0,This is the man you need to go to if youre ever struggling in math he will tell you step by step and wont confuse you
8325,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,2.0,Mr. Butler made a difficult subject easy. He is very organized and detailed. You will know what is s expected of you. Drops the lowest grade and if you get an 85 or above you are exempt from the final! AMAZING TEACHER!!!
8326,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,2.0,"Beat math professor if u dont understand shows how to do the work step by step instructions, and shows it in different ways to help each and one of us and his really funny respectful and patient I love him best math professor I have ever had."

8329,599578,Reginald,Butler,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor. I have never understood math, yet he makes it easy for me. I took him for MAT0022 and again for MAT1033C, and wish he taught at a higher level. He is funny, caring, an easy grader, and provides amazing examples and notes and answers questions with a positive attitude. Never makes a student feel like a question is unnecessary!"
8331,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,4.0,2.0,"Wrote like 3 papers and 1 research paper. Seems a lot but it's really not, he gives a lot of time in class to work with too."
8332,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Extremely easy, tells you exactly what to write and how to write. If you don't pay attention, good luck passing."

8335,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,This class allows you to use your imagination. You will never be blue in this class.
8336,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1001,5.0,3.0,Dude he is awesome and really funny  #savege #blue
8337,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,Really interesting class! Enjoyed everything we learned. Professor Hale has great things to talk about and is never not wearing a Nike outfit.
8338,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"I actually look forward to his class. We can get the work done, while having a little fun. He is very thorough and helps the students to understand the concept. It is hard to ever feel blue in his class, because he is always making the class laugh"
8339,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,I never once felt blue in this class! Hale is an amazing teacher and he will help any mediocre writer get noticeably better. One of the best teachers I've ever had.
8340,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,"Professor Hale was extremely clear in his expectations in addition to the class work required.  He was also very helpful in facilitating probing discussions for topic selection.  Show up ON TIME for class and definitely do the reading ... he will ask random questions about it such as ""Was the sky blue today?"".  A very funny professor."
8341,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,This professor is awesome! I would certainly take his class if I have another English course available on campus!
8342,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,AML2020,5.0,3.0,Great guy all around.
8343,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,4.0,3.0,I love this professor! He gets to the point and doesn't take bs and doesn't give it back. It is a very entertaining class.
8344,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,AML,5.0,1.0,"Such a fun an awesome teacher, I have never been a fan of English before this class. He makes his students want to show up to class and engage in the  conversations about the stories. Seriously be prepared for a whole class of laughter. If you don't pass his, you wont pass any English class. If your lazy and have poor attendance you will fail."
8345,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.5,4.0,Never stays on track when talking. Very hard for someone who likes a clear cut lecture to take notes on. Wouldn't suggest taking him.
8346,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.5,3.0,"He is very specific, if it's not exactly how he wants it you won't get a good grade; Granted he does let you make a certain amount of things up. He spends a lot of time getting off track or joking making it confusing to follow along. Not very helpful when you ask questions or email him at all. "
8347,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,4.5,2.0,"I loved showing up to class everyday because Hale is hilarious. He will answer any question you ask, and explains his grading style clearly. He will talk to everyone in the class, even if you don't talk to him. Have a sense of humor because he is hilarious."
8348,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,David Hale has a joking and friendly personality.  You must show up to class and never be late or your grade will definitely be low.  Make sure you do all assignments exactly what he says for you to do.  His class was very relaxed and not hard core learning. Pretty simple and he's very clear on his assignments.  Definitely take him!!!
8349,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,5.0,1.0,"I love Hale! Took him for English 1, 2, &amp; American literature. I got an A in all 3 classes. You will pass as long as you show up to class and do what he wants. The class is always very funny too not as boring as you would imagine. Definitely take him! "
8350,259622,David,Hale,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,4.5,1.0,He's really clear about what he expects from you. As long as you give him what he's looking for this class is an easy A. Class was always interesting with Hale's humor.
8352,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045L,3.0,4.0,She makes you work for it and a very tough grader. That's all.
8353,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1025,4.0,3.0,I think she is a great professor and the way she tells stories to link them to the material that we are learning is very helpful in my opinion. The text book is not required and she does gives extra credit
8354,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2211,4.0,4.0,"the class is hard, its orgo. she has a lot of bad reviews but I think she is a great teacher. she is smart and she helps as much as she can. no curve but will give extra work for extra points. SHE WANTS YOU TO PASS!! don't expect for the grade to be handed to you but the extra credit, homework and office hours will help."
8355,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1046,5.0,3.0,"Shes the best chem prof. !! you should absolutely take her because you will know more stuff about chemistry from her than from any other chem prof. She teaches very thorough. Her tests are straightforward and only have stuff that she already teached, no tricky stuff. Anyone who took chem 1 with her always follow her until organic! Shes that gud!"
8356,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1045L,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFFESSOR !!! One of the worst professors at this college, expects you to know everything, and does not teach at ALL. When asking for help, she comes off very rude. She doesn't clearly explain the lab nor the pre lab quizzes, you have to take before every class. Do not take if you actually want to learn !!"
8357,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1045L,1.0,5.0,"From the first day you could tell she didnt want to be there. If you want help, good luck, youll be greeted with attitude and treated like youre an idiot for not understanding. The class itself isnt hard but if its not answered/done the way SHE wants it then its wrong and she wont tell you its wrong until youve already got a 0 for it."
8358,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045,2.0,5.0,She nice but an awful teacher!! I barely scraped by with a B. How ever she did give extra credit.
8359,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1046,3.0,3.0,"I had to take CHM1046 in 6 weeks.. not my first choice. However, I found her tests really stressful; at times she'd take points off for silly things like sig figs or capitalized letters. I believe if the student understands the concept &amp; shows the work they should receive credit when its due. After taking her course I wouldn't recommend her."
8360,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045,3.0,5.0,Just take someone else!!
8361,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045,4.0,3.0,She is a decent professor. Her lectures can be sometimes be confusing and you have to teach yourself but the test are pretty easy. First half of the test is mainly multiple choice which consist of vocab and general questions. Second half is like balancing and etc. If you study and do the practice problems that is on her her google page youll be ok
8362,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045,1.0,5.0,"She is your worst option. I was warned about her but I took her anyway, horrible mistake! She explains things in ways only she would understand, many of us were confused. I had to constantly teach myself everything and was often anxious and in panic when I would get stuck on something I couldn't understand. This was my worst experience at pbsc :("
8363,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1045,2.0,5.0,"During my semester w/ Prof. Judd, she was late 2 or 3 times, which is fine, but what's not okay is being completely absent twice in a row for class. There are students like myself who drive 60 miles to and fro class. I was never good in Chemistry, but her lectures are unnecessarily bland. Her enthusiasm to teach matched my own to keep attending."
8364,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1025,5.0,3.0,"My poor grade is a reflection of my poor time management. She is nice, polite, and funny. She makes herself available as needed. She is very clear about the content in the course and answers all questions asked. I will be retaking her in other courses. Practice sets and notes are a must for quizzes."
8365,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM2210L,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher ive ever had... ive never failed a class until this one, especially a lab. She grades your products so hard were other teachers dont even grade them. Wont tell you if you if you are doing the experiment right or wrong and just a stressful experience all together"
8366,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1046,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE HER! take any other professor. go to a different campus! Judd makes things 100x harder than they need to be. needs to be fired. does not explain anything and expects u to know the material as well as her even tho shes been teaching it forever. worst professor on this campus. 1 of her class was canceled bc barely anyone signed up!
8367,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1046,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I have ever taken. dont recommend her at all no matter how good u r @ chem. Ive always been good at chem but she really makes it more difficult than need be. Doesnt care if u pass or fail. Laughs when the class average is bad. seems to take joy out of kids failing. doesnt explain anything. i promise u will regret taking her.
8368,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1045,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, Judd is amazing. Im not sure why people dont like her. She only lectures on what is going to be on the test, goes over the math/reaction problems on the board, and is always to the point. I whole heartedly believe she doesnt get the credit she deserves. If you like teachers that go step by step and arent all over the place, take her."
8369,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHEM1045,1.0,5.0,Horrible professor dont take her
8370,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045,5.0,5.0,"Alright Y'all, If you want to pass with minimal effort, don't take Judd. But if you're serious about learning and love chemistry, Judd is one of my favorite professors. I took her class from Chm 2 through Orgo 2. She tests you on comprehension, these are SERIOUS tests, this is not a walk in the park, panzy art class. Study hard, 2-3 hours a day."
8371,259802,Cynthia,Judd,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Chemistry,CHM1045,1.0,4.0,"Professor Judd lectures all class. She is terrible at explaining and in my opinion just wants to get the lesson over and done with. I had to retake chm1045, I took it online and received an A! I wish I would have withdrawn from her class sooner. You have 5 tests and thats all your grades for the entire semester, no extra credit. Good luck"
8373,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,3.0,3.0,He talks a lot and gets off topic at times. He does not dismiss class early so he literally lectures till the class is over. He only has 3 tests and an outline which is crucial to your grade. He does not post grades on blackboard so you'll need to see him during his office hours. Overall he's an okay professor.
8374,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,2.0,2.0,I don't recommend this professor at all. He tends to get off topic a lot. Only grades in the class are 4 tests and one outline which is like your final.
8375,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,3.0,He is a good professor who really cares about history. He has everything set out. Just take notes and study for three tests. No homework at all.
8376,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2050,3.0,3.0,Hes not the worst but hes not the best. Three tests and one outline make up your entire grade. He does not use Blackboard so its your responsibility to calculate your grade which can be confusing and after taking the final Im not sure how Im gonna get my grade. He can be a bit rude but the class is not hard Im ending with an A or a B.
8377,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,1.0,"3 Tests, 1 Outline that is mandatory to be eligible for his curve! Some of these reviews were quite funny to me because this class is SUPER EASY! Yes he talks about all the trips he has been on but if you fail this class, you simply did not pay attention or you just lack common sense. Attendance is not mandatory!"
8378,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,3.0,Super nice guy! Class is composed of 3 exams and one final outline of all your notes. No assignments in between. Theres also a curve for your exams and he does a review the class before which is a major help. Just make sure u get all ur notes in and your good!
8379,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,1.0,3.0,This professor is the worst professor ive had at palm beach state. You have 3 tests and an outline. His notes are unclear. ALWAYS OFF TOPIC. Never answered questions when confused. After finishing my test I asked if there were two different versions So I could write it on my Scantron he got mad and told me its not my business.. AWFUL PROFESSOR
8380,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,4.0,2.0,"This guy was funny! His grading system was weird, the course is graded on 3 tests and an outline. He is vague on what the outline is and when it is due. But if you take notes during his lectures and show up for the test reviews, you'll be fine for the tests. just make sure you get the outline right."
8381,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,5.0,1.0,"literally the easiest class ever. only 3 exams (30 questions on #1 and #2, 35 on #3) and an outline which can just be your class notes typed out. he goes over exactly what will be on the tests the class before. he does tend to get off topic a lot but he makes up for it with how easy the class is. NO BOOK REQUIRED WHATSOEVER!"
8382,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,5.0,2.0,"There are only 3 exams and 1 outline. The notes you take in class cover all the content in the class but reading the textbook will help. He dedicates an entire class before the exam to review, in which he basically gives you answers to the questions on the test. Show up to class, he will give you a curve for good attendance and doing all the work."
8383,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,2.0,3.0,"I had him for US history 1856-present. His style of teaching is very unorganized and confusing. He jumps around in the timeline so much that sometimes I wouldnt even know where we were in history. He also refuses to use Blackboard, leaving you in suspense all semester long about your grades. I dont even know what I got on the final."
8384,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,1.0,"Professor Cuan is a very straight to the point professor. Yes, he does tend to get sidetracked. He always lectures exactly what will be on your tests. Only 3 exams and an outline which you can copy straight from your notes. He is very lively and keeps the class interesting. Everyone complaining about him obviously did not pay attention in his class"
8385,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH1010,5.0,3.0,"If you're interested in History, He is the teacher to take the class with. He does tend to go off topic from time to time and show slides of his trips but all relevant. He is enjoys his subject and is funny. 3 exams 1 outline for the curve. Get ready to take notes and I never used the book. I did learn a lot. Simply pay attention."
8386,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,2.0,4.0,"Tests were not difficult if you go to the review. He rejected my outline 3x. I had so much stress because he would not accept my outline. I did not appreciate the way he talked about women. He is lazy and does not upload grades to Blackboard at all. Terrible at giving feedback. Don't rent the textbook, I didn't use it except for the outline."
8387,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,1.0,5.0,"You have to show up in order for you to pass. He gives notes which is okay. But when he teaches, he knows what he talks about, but he goes way too fast and goes out of topic easily. He only does 3 test if you want a professor like him, but he is also had at communication. I wouldn't recommend taking him."
8388,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,3.0,3.0,"Professor Cuan is an okay professor. Im not a fan of history, but I managed to get an A with his curve. It is SUPER IMPORTANT that you show up for all 3 of his exams and do the outline! Or else you wont get the curve. Beware, his exams require you to genuinely understand the subject, not just memorize his notes. I wouldnt take him again tbh."
8389,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,1.0,4.0,"He gets off of subject VERY EASILY! We can go from talking about the Spanish Civil War to Donald Trump/JFK/politics, and he'll talk about it the whole class. One class, we spent a whole 30 minutes looking at pictures from one of his trips. Very vague in class but the tests are a different story. Kinda funny. But ""funny"" doesn't help you pass."
8390,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,1.0,1.0,"Do not sit in the front, he's a spitter! If you answer a question correctly, he'll say you're wrong and just rearrange your answer into his own sentence, yet remember you're still wrong. He just shows pictures of his vacation trips to correlate to the history lesson. Would not take him again, even though I got an A. It's a dreadful class."
8391,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,1.0,1.0,"If you show up to class every time it is scheduled, you will pass with an A. You get three tests and a really easy 4 page annotated outline that's due at the end of the semester. BEWARE: He gets side tracked so much and ALL HE DOES is talk about himself and his vacay trips. P.S. I have classmates that only came on review day and passed with an A."
8392,412193,Omar,Cuan,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,1.0,One of my favorite teachers! His class is super easy. All you have to do is show up to every class to get the notes on the lecture. ALL his test are based on what is said in class. During the whole semester there is only 3 test and a 4 page outline due. I recommend everyone to take this class.
8394,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,1.0,5.0,"If you want to pass go take anyone else, I didn't even sign up for his class and got switched over to him because he was full time, I did hybrid and the material for quizzes was no where to be found and you have to video tape yourself for the test and he is pretty disrespectful, don't do it, I'm tell in you."
8395,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BCS2085,1.0,4.0,Very rude and condescending professor treats you like your a complete moron if you ask the slightest question. Will give you a 0 just because he can. Would NOT recommend his class to anyone ever. Best thing I ever did was drop his class !!!!!Am
8396,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BCS2085,5.0,5.0,"It is a good college because professors like Dr. VS, but I will be transferring to a University once I get my associates. I'll miss you Dr."
8397,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010,1.0,2.0,"Extremely condescending. Unclear with instructions. Does not take responsibility when he makes mistakes. Awful, awful, awful. He doesn't even seem to enjoy teaching or communicating with students. Will never take a class with this profressor again."
8398,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,1.0,5.0,"Didn't show up to our first day of class, and it just went downhill from there. He was not helpful at all, he was just rude to students."
8399,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,"If you study what you learn in his class you can't go wrong, really great professor- don't yawn in his class."
8400,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor VS online A&amp;P classes and it was pretty straightforward. There are four tests, section quizzes, and chapter discussions. It may seem kind of tedious, but it is fairly easy if you put in some effort."
8401,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010,5.0,3.0,"He is a good teacher, and, teaches well, makes sure you understand, and he's very direct and gets straight to the point. His lectures are super amazing, you can never get bored with him and he's very funny. If you like intellectual jokes, choose Dr. VS"
8402,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,5.0,4.0,"I did take A&amp;P 1 with another professor, and, it was nice only Dr. V. class is superior to all my classes. Read instruction, follow direction, you will be happy as I am. He is the best."
8403,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,4.0,4.0,"Professor VS is an amazing teacher and person. There's no trick questions or hidden information, what he expects you to know for the tests is all from the lecture. If you love science, this class will be intriguing and engaging, and if you don't, it's still easy to get an A if you show up to class and put some effort in outside of class."
8404,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010,5.0,4.0,He can be intimidating sometimes but really pushes students to use their maximum talent. Says it like it is; truly cares for students success and wellbeing
8405,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BCS2085,5.0,3.0,"He is knowledgeable, to some degree funny and engages everyone to be part of the discussion. His answers are always very detailed."
8406,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,1.0,4.0,"I am taking his hybrid class, so we meet once a week for an hour. During that hour, we do not learn a single thing about anatomy. He rambles on for the hour about one subject that doesnt even pertain to A&amp;P. When students ask questions, he responds ""you werent paying attention."" He is very disrespectful. He also never answers students questions."
8407,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,5.0,3.0,He made all his lectures engaging by using visuals and personal stories to aid in his teaching. Every test or quiz I recall taking was multiple choice so just make a quizlet and go over the material a few times and you're all set.
8408,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BCS2085,5.0,4.0,I took this class a second time. I should enroll in Professor V class from the beginning. If you do what he asks - you will be happy and I do realize - I did learn.
8409,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010,4.0,3.0,Professor Vetaley Stashenko is a very knowledgeable person. He really teaches interesting things and answer all questions that students might have. He does give a lot of work but it is not that hard. As long as you do the work you will be fine.
8410,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BCS2085,1.0,4.0,"This Professor is all over the place. His class is so unstructured, unorganized, and unclear. If you ask any questions he always answers you back with vague, broad, and sometimes sarcastic responses. Grading is a mess and doesn't make any sense. You won't learn A&amp;P, you will just focus on completing the large amounts of assignments he gives."
8411,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086L,1.0,4.0,"If you do not know Anatomy well, do not take him. Every homework assignment i turned it in hoping it was correct &amp; complete because he wasn't even sure what needed to be done. ugh. Overall, my experience made me go to class with a high heart rate because it was nothing but stress."
8412,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086L,2.0,4.0,"I decided to listen to the good reviews and give him the benefit of the doubt and all i can say is DONT DO IT. Our class started with about 20 students, now there's only 4 (if that doesn't tell you something). All over the place, grading makes no sense. Constantly correcting him on tests. Doesn't give straight forward answers. Just don't do it"
8413,1072709,Vetaley,Stashenko,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086L,2.0,3.0,"Instructions are all over the place, unclear. Beats around the bush instead of giving straight forward answers. Had to correct him multiple times on answers on test because my answers were right and his were wrong. The class is doable but it's more of a headache than anything. If the guy could get it together he might actually be a good professor."
8415,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,COP1000,3.0,2.0,"I am actually currently taking this class and I couldn't help but hop on here as soon as possible. The class is super easy, but don't expect to learn too much programming. We only used Python once and is heavily reliant on Flowgorithm. She won't answer your questions and gives you feedback like ""great"", ""change"", or ""contact tutors""."
8416,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,3.0,"This class was very easy for me, she was very communicative. If someone didnt know something we could easily go to her"
8417,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,2.0,"I took class online ( first time doing online ) and it was a great experience, she was awesome and the assignments are easy. An easy A. Take her!!!! You will not regret it"
8418,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,4.0,1.0,"The class is straight forward. The website is organized well. Does all her grading through Connect, so grades are immediate. You can retry assignments up to 5 times, and quizzes are fairly easy. One thing I did not realize before taking was that the entire course is learning Microsoft. Easy A as long as you meet due dates and follow instructions."
8419,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,1.0,"Class was very easy, she is lenient and gives you plenty of time to do your assignments. If one closes before you finish just ask and she will reopen it. I am taking her again next semester for something else because she is very easy to work with."
8420,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,3.0,3.0,good stuff
8421,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,4.0,3.0,Nice professor
8422,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,2.0,Murcia is the perfect professor for this course
8423,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,4.0,2.0,"If you have a MAC not recommended, easy but time consuming."
8424,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,2.0,perfect class!!!!
8425,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher, show up and get hands on guidance then repeat at home, easy A"
8426,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,1.0,Amazing professor hilarious if you got the jokes and just show up to class and pay attention and you will pass
8427,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1000,5.0,4.0,This class is for those who have little to no knowledge of Microsoft Office. It provides knowledge of subject matter that is useful in the 21st Century.
8428,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,4.0,"Loved this professor and this class, but skipping class if you have no prior experience or struggle with computer programs is detrimental. Class always consisted of doing one of the assignments with the professor before sending us off on our own to do the rest. Lots of work in a very short amount of time but most effective way of learning."
8429,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,4.0,1.0,Very easy class as long as you show up and do the work assigned.
8430,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,1.0,"I highly recommend this professor if you would like to learn Microsoft, whether you have never used the programs or if you want to brush up on your skills. Very sweet lady as well."
8431,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,3.0,1.0,Not the best professor for this subject but she is very nice. If you have any issues she will give you more time as long as you communicate properly. Overall a low stress class
8432,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,4.0,"Great Professor! 10/10 would recommend. If you are struggling at all, she will guide you through everything!"
8433,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,CGS1100,5.0,1.0,"Do yourself a favor and sign up for this professor. She is very nice, you will leave the class with a better understanding of microsoft office, and the class is very low stress which in my opinion is exactly how learning about office should be!"
8434,1627280,Jeanne,Murcia,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Computer Science,COP1000,5.0,3.0,show up do the work. open book
8436,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,4.0,2.0,"Professor Arbona is a great professor, Although she no longer teachers at Pbsc. She is very knowledgeable at what she does. I took her for human growth &amp; psychology. She speeds through her lecture quickly because of time. Attendance is mandatory for her class. All her assignments are on blackboard under mindtap."
8437,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,5.0,"She guides you through the textbook pretty expertly and quickly. If you didnt read it, then youre going to have a slightly harder time than those who did. She is open about her opinions but she is inclusive of the entire class. I found her lectures to be extremely informative and useful outside of the classroom."
8438,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,4.0,Ms Arbona is a one of a kind professor. I was lucky to be one of her students on her very last semester at PBSC. She's very thorough and specific in her lectures. I honestly didn't write a lot of notes because I really understood what she was talking about. Inspirational and I always left the classroom feeling like I learned something useful.
8439,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PHY2012,3.0,3.0,"Took her class in the summer. showing up to class was mandatory, and being late unacceptable because she would take points away from your grade. Doesnt give enough time to let you finish taking notes because she would go through the slide quick . She is funny &amp; rude. And she doesnt really like To help you. Shes quick at leaving after class."
8440,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,4.0,I did everything I could to get an A in this class and even if you do everything is really tough to get an A. She is really nice and I loved her class you will learn a lot.
8441,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,2.0,4.0,"Listening to her lecture was extremely boring. She is extremely opinionated and very rude and disrespectful at times. All of the homework, quizzes, and tests are on blackboard and mintap. She is the only professor that teaches this course with mindtap. She doesn't budge on late work or not completing assignments on time."
8442,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004PSY2012,5.0,4.0,"I have taken Professor Arbona for two classes.  I really do enjoy her lectures, she makes class interactive  in the way that she teaches her classes she explains the material in applicable ways. She is a great professor, very straight forward. Lots of online homework from learning modules but they are fair and you have to keep up with deadlines."
8443,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,4.0,4.0,"She's really nice, and gives so much information. Honestly if you're there and focused you'll do just fine."
8444,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012DEP2004,4.0,3.0,"I have taken this professor twice. she is very knowable and has many years of clinical experience with patients but she tries to make psychology a harder class than necessary. you have one assignment per chapter, a quiz and a test. you MUST read the book, you MUST go to class. and you MUST participate. she's very strong willed in her beliefs."
8445,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PHY2012,5.0,1.0,"I've taken her for two different classes and she is truly one of the Best Professors I've had. I've learned a lot in her classes, she knows what she talking about and is passionate about what she teaches, she actually cares. She can be funny at times. Easy A as long as you show up, pay attention, and do your work. Would take her again."
8446,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,2.0,4.0,She was very hard to understand sometimes and was very confusing you will not pass this class if you do not study the book and find psychology interesting she is a very tough grader also mind tap is useless for her exams and her tests are honestly pretty hard but long as you participate and do great on the gordon rule at the end you will survive.
8447,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2023,4.0,3.0,"She makes her expectations of you as clear as day. She can be feisty sometimes, but only to help you succeed. If you aren't one to participate, not the class for you. She is very knowledgable but can be hard to understand due to her accent. In the long run, I would take her again if need be. Easy A if you're willing to put in the work!"
8448,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,4.5,4.0,"Extremely intelligent professor. Will not tolerate being disrespected at all. She really wants her students to take something away from the class. All tests and homework are online. Do not half-ass the Gordon Rule writing assignment. She is very clear with exactly what she wants. Be on time, as she does give a grade for attendance!"
8449,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PHY2012,2.5,3.0,She has a Spanish accent so beware of that. Also she can get really slick sometimes and like to make fun of students in class. She can get really rude and disrespectful at people. All her quizzes and tests are online so that's the easy part. . I would only take her again if I was truly desperate.
8450,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,4.5,2.0,Dr. Arbona is a fabulous professor. She can be a little sassy but she knows what she is doing! You will learn A LOT in her class. She wants you to understand the martial and lays it out for you. Don't skip class or come late because you will get points taken off your grade. She is the BEST professor I have ever had. EXTREMELY intelligent!
8451,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,CLP2001,3.0,2.0,"I would not take her again.  She is an OK teacher and the class isn't hard, but she says things like, ""I can put myself in your dreams"".  The level of crazy was WAY too high for me.  If you are not bothered by a person who is not all there, then it's an easy A.  If you find it difficult to deal with someone who says crazy things, then skip it."
8452,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,4.5,2.0,"Dr. Arbona is an amazing professor! She is extremely knowledgeable about psychology and has many years of clinical practice. She is very fair with grading, and her work load. All of her assignments are online, including test. As long as you read the text and listen to her lectures there no way to not pass. And she takes her lecture time very seriou"
8453,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY2012,4.5,4.0,"Dr. Arbona is tough but extremely knowledgable. She makes the class relatable and funny. THE most inspirational class i've ever taken. You have to read but if you take the web enhanced class, MindTap basically studies for you. The end of the year paper was a self-reflection(easy). She wants us to use the class to become a better person and I have!!"
8454,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,3.0,4.0,TAKE PROFESSOR EDWARD BLAIR OR PROFESSOR MIA OCEAN INSTEAD! Professor Arbona has the nastiest comments. So if you are the type of person that takes things to heart do NOT take this class. There have been multiple times where I wanted to walk out because of her rude comments. But I dont cuz she WILL take points away if you leave class early.
8455,410085,Maria,Arbona,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,2.5,4.0,"Listen here guys.. she only gives 5pts extra credit for the food drive during Thx-Giving. She also adds points to tests if you attend SI sessions and those are stupid because its at different times of the day and are not held by the professor. A student does it. So, I hope you guys are lucky and the extra sessions are at times you are available.  "
8457,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Brecker is hilarious. I took him for both AP1 and AP2. One of my favorite teachers overall. He will make you learn your stuff and his exams are not easy, but he literally gives you all of the material to study, so it's not that difficult either. Go to class because he explains things really well."
8458,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,4.0,3.0,Dr. Brecker gives no homework what so ever. You show up to class take notes and review at home. There are 5 test. The lowest be will dropped and the final you must take which also will not be dropped. Everything in his notes is fair game on the test so there are no surprises. Study and know the notes inside and out and you should be fine.
8459,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC1010,2.0,4.0,"Brecker is ok. I will NOT take him again. No homework. There are 6 tests, the lowest grade gets dropped but this can also be detrimental. No book required he provides you with all the notes. The tests are very specific so you really have to study the notes. He changes the words around to confuse you. The 6th test is considered the final."
8460,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,3.0,4.0,He is very knowledgeable. His lectures are from his notes. Tests are from notes he provides. You do not need a text book. Talks a lot about himself. Hates everything in today's world. Makes you feel stupid if you ask a question or if you answer incorrectly.
8461,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,1.0,"He is a great professor does make u work for that A he really does help not like the most professor who just says "" yeah just read every single word from the textbook"" no this professor will go to each page and say highlight this. This will be on the exam :0 wat professor does that .someone who is willing to help you get that A :)"
8462,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,4.0,4.0,"Brecker is tough. The good thing about his class is that he gives us his own notes, and his tests are all on his notes. So technically, you have to read and study them because they will all be on there. His lectures are ok; he reads off the notes and follows a PowerPoint. He always tries to make the class laugh."
8463,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,AP1,5.0,2.0,"Wow, what a wonderful teacher. His very passionate about teaching."
8464,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC1085,4.0,4.0,Great Professor you will learn a lot. You must study to do well on the tests. Questions can be a little challenging but as long as you study you will be fine. I took him for lecture and lab. Lab was easier for me than lecture just because its hands on and he gives exact whats on each quiz or midterm/final.
8465,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BC2085,5.0,4.0,"Awesome Professor, really wants you to do well. 10/10 serious learners only!"
8466,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,1.0,5.0,"TEST QUESTION ARE NOT VERY SEICIFICED, example ""which of the following is incorrect"" so you don't know incorrect about what!!,  and multiple answers A,B,&amp;C so the answer is ""E"" lots of matching questions, OUT OF A CLASS OF ABOUT 34 ONLY 9 TOOK THE FINALS. DON'T TAKE THIS GUY, HE IS FULL OF HIMSELF AND THINKS THAT HE IS THE BEST THING AT PBSC."
8467,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Brecker is the best professor you can get for Anatomy 1 and 2 lecture. He is so funny and goes out of his way to explain the processes. His notes are all online and his tests are based off of them. If you aren't willing to learn, don't take him, but he is preparing you for the HESI and you will leave this course understanding the material."
8468,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BC2085,5.0,2.0,"Don't buy the text book. The tests are literally taken straight off of his notes. EVERY. SINGLE. QUESTION. No comprehensive questions. If you fail the class, you didn't study his notes. Point blank. I've taken him for both AP1 and AP2 lecture and haven't had a problem. It's ANATOMY. It's not going to be a walk in the park. That's the point."
8469,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,1.0,4.0,"If you want a teacher who talks about his life than actually teaches hes great for you. His test are difficult and he is PROUD to say that ""no one passes my first exam"" 90% of my class failed his course. This is the first and only class that i have failed, if you value your gpa stay away from him"
8470,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,2085L,4.0,3.0,"Alright listen up. He is not that difficult, he has all the notes online and literally gives tests of off notes that you have access to so really how could you fail?? you just have to study and you're good to go. He drops one test out of 4 (not including final). He can get annoying sometimes but otherwise hes pretty chill."
8471,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,"He is a great professor. All of the tests were based off of his notes. If you don't print the notes, you won't pass. He doesn't use the book at all, so don't but it if you take this professor. He only gives extra credit for going to si sessions. Make sure you go to class. If you don't understand the notes, he clears up the confusion in lecture."
8472,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,3.0,"DO NOT BUY A TEXTBOOK! Print out his lecture notes! EVERYTHING on his tests comes DIRECTLY from his lecture notes! Go to class!! READ READ READ his notes &amp; you will pass!!

He lectures during class on his notes, and if you take the time to study them (on his faculty page) you will do PERFECTLY on his exams! I've never missed more than two questions out of 70 or more so far! People make it harder than what it is. It's Anatomy. You need to study. He doesn't try to trick you. He's awesome."
8475,1184999,Edward,Brecker,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC1085L,3.0,3.0,Only teaches what you will need for the test. Clear lectures. Makes a hard class very simple. you will need to spend a lot of time outside of class Studying.

8480,1637405,Ralston,Brown,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,1.0,"honestly the only ineffective aspect about Professor Brown's lessons was the inevitability of the end of the period, which I have NEVER been able to say about a math class before. it was as if the class just flew by, and I found myself wishing I could stay longer! Professor Brown made sure to address all assignments and exams long before due date"

8541,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SP1017,1.0,5.0,"worst professor ever do not take him if it's not necessary, you don't know your grade until the end of the semester when he posted on panther web, so I don't even know why I got a low grade when I did all the assignments DO NOT TAKE HIM"
8542,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,"This a great professor. Class participation and attendance is MANDATORY!!! If you have a problem receiving criticism, this is the professor for you. Tough greater, but understandable. Great guy very hilarious, and very easy to talk to and available outside of class."
8543,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,1.0,3.0,Professor Gents idea of an student who deserves an A is unattainable realistically. There are few things that students are graded on and Gent drops people from class if they have missed 4 classes.
8544,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,3.0,4.0,"Your class is going to be based off three-four tests, and two projects; YET, he will never post your grades online. He does not update you and you are left guessing. He is a good professor and his class was fun, but I rather have a teacher who updates me then leaves me feeling anxious a semester long."
8545,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,1.0,5.0,"Professor Gent is obviously not the best professor BUT if you are a communications major this is a perfect person to help you build knowledge on that department, he is very wise in this subject but as an educator hes not the best. Very judgmental, sensitive,and does have a tendency of being passive aggressive. Not for the weak."
8546,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,1.0,5.0,"Simply dont take this guy if you really want to have a good time learning, hes so close minded and can be really teasing at time."
8547,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SP1017,1.0,4.0,"As a FORMER straight-A student because of his class, I can say that he is the worst teacher I have ever had. I attend every class, do all my work, but his tests are impossibly hard even with studying. He does not post any grades, he ignores emails when you try to contact him, and it does not take much to trigger his attitude. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS"
8548,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1011,1.0,5.0,"Lemme tell you something, dont take this professor, absolutely insecure about everything so he will take any feedback as an insult. especially dont challenge his opinion"
8549,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SP1017,1.0,5.0,Do yourself a favor and find another teacher to take. I think that this subject is a subject that should help students with their speech but his class your diminished for expressing your concerns unless its on HIS terms. Its like your a high school student not a PAYING college student. Long story short I reported him to the department. DONT TAKE
8550,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,1.0,3.0,"picks on the smallest thing, wont know your grade until semester is over, he constantly drags students, h thinks hes the smartest person alive, if you ask him anything he will straight up laugh at you then give you a slick answer. his grading depends on his opinion of the topic so dont write about something he might no like, he will question you."
8551,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,4.0,4.0,"Great teacher but he is old school, respect him an he will respect you. NO PHONES, if your phone goes off in class or even a watch he will kick you out of the class. He only gives 1 speech which is great. He explains things very well."
8552,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,Makes you work for your grade but easy class to pass 1. DO not talk unless spoken to 2. No Phones (leave it in the car honestly) 3. Respect him and he will respect you
8553,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,"When I tell you this guy is awesome, I mean it! Not only is he class extremely useful in life, but he lectures are also very important, interesting, inspirational, emotional, and I can keep the list going on forever. Of course like all teachers he has his beliefs, but he also addresses that us student have thoughts and ideas, doesnt happen often."
8554,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,PSC1017,5.0,4.0,"I have gone against the ratings here and take professor Gent for the summer and by far,he is the best . He is indeed strict, the tests aren't easy but we had a great time. He made us laugh the entire semester."
8555,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,2.0,4.0,"His lectures are fine but his projects and speeches are actually awful. He freaks out over the smallest of details, and he feels the need to drag students down for the smallest of errors. Unless you feel like dealing with one of the most petty professors I've had so far, stay far away from this man's classroom."
8556,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SP1017,1.0,5.0,"Do not take this professor!!!! I wish I could have withdraw from his class. the first day he already yelled and embarrassed several students. He is so extra and rude, he takes pleasure in demolishing his students. his tests are extremely hard and even tho this is a communication class he knows nothing about listening which is 50% of communication."
8557,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,1.0,4.0,"he grades on 2 tests: 50q each, 1 group assignment worth 20% and 1 speech worth 40%. As a person, he is unbearable. He is rude, talks down to his students. Is not understanding, will encourage students to participate and ask questions so that when you do, he will tear you apart and embarrass you. He is like a mall cop. Dont take him please."
8558,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1011,1.0,3.0,"Professor Gent is a horrible teacher. He knows the material and can teach it, but he's extremely rude to all of his students and talks down to everyone. He's extra and picks on people, for basically doing nothing. This isn't an exaggeration. His tests are impossible, even when you study. I don't recommend him and wish I had chosen someone else."
8559,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,1.0,5.0,"Hates his students, yells at them, tells you to participate then yells at you for not partipating, tells you talk to much, told me to give more effort in and out of class when he doesnt know me out of class, asked who I was then yelled at me for talking to much when i dont open my mouth in class. Dont take him ever."
8560,333618,Victor,Gent,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,1.0,4.0,"He is very rude and arrogant. Once threatened to withdraw me for using headphones/phone AFTER class was dismissed. Talks down to his students. Sometimes will treat a student as if they're a child. Do not take his class, and definitely would not recommend him."
8562,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,1.0,This was my very first class to take at Palm Beach State and I couldn't have asked for a better teacher. She's very good at explaining things and helps you when you need it. Her work is easy as long as you pay attention in class and do your work on time. Highly recommend you take her especially if you're taking Introduction to Sociology.
8563,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,1.0,"HANDS DOWN,BEST TEACHER EVER! i WISH SHE WAS MY PROCESSOR FOR EVER CLASS I HAD TO TAKE,MAKES CLASS FUN AND ALSO YOU LEARN A LOT VERY INTERESTING TOPICS,LOVE HER, YOU WILL NOT REGRET MEETING HER AT ALL."
8564,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,3.0,2.0,"The grade that you have on Blackboard is not the grade you actually have in th e class. She is a good teacher and she tries to make you laugh (sometimes her jokes are not funny but she tries her best). She tries to keep the class entertaining and fun. If she gives you something to read, READ IT, there will either be a class discussion or on a test."
8565,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,1.0,"Professor Naylor is an amazing teacher, she makes class fun! Just show up for class and study for her test and you'll pass. You won't regret taking her!"

Everything on test and quizzes are from notes and lectures, pay attention and study you'll do fine. This was an elective class I took and definitely take her again in the spring for another elective. Respect is earned not given, so if you don't get along with her then YOU'RE the problem. Class goes by fast."
8567,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,Might be the best professor I've ever had. Gives lectures that actually teach you something and dont just waste your time. Very knowledgeable and really loves teaching. She actually wants you to get a A and grades very fair. Dont take this class if you are lazy and dont like showing up on time and submitting things on time.
8568,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,1.0,"She is amazing, hilarious, caring and fun! Take her you wont regret it! I wish we had more professors like her!"
8569,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,2.0,"Prof Naylor is such a gem. Every lecture she pours her heart into, and genuinely wants you to learn and understand. Her assignments and quizzes are not bad at all unless you actually pay attention in class &amp; take notes. She offers plenty of xtra credit. One research paper, but gives you clear instructions on how to write it literally word for word."
8570,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2000,5.0,1.0,professor naylor is so smart and fine asf

8576,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I've had in my college experience so far. Professor Naylor is inspirational and really good at lecturing literally everything she writes on the board will be good to study for tests and exams. This class keeps you openminded and aware of society issues. She makes sure that you will pass the class with all the bonus given.
8577,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2430,5.0,2.0,"AMAZING. I took her Marriage and Family class and it was awesome. Class is never boring, and you can tell that she truly cares about what she's teaching. Assignments are super easy, barely any reading or writing, quizzes are short and simple, and tests are all multiple choice and true/false with extra credit. Great class, definitely recommend."
8578,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,"My advice after taking this course? Fact-check your arguments beforehand because she will not hesitate to call out your time wasting, easily-bruised ego-fueled rants to tell you why you're wrong. She is truly one of the best professors that Palm Beach State offers and I would highly recommend her to anybody."
8579,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,2.0,"Love this professor! She truly cares about her students and her lectures are hilarious!!

8581,1218663,Heather,Naylor,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,5.0,1.0,She was the best professor Ive had. I learned so much and she taught us in a way that made me consider being a sociologist. Learned so much and she is a wonderful person overall! Always cares about her students and gives tons of extra credit. Free textbooks for both of her classes I took. Loved this class
8583,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,3.0,"I took professor Kachlany for a&amp;p 1 lecture/lab and got As in both. Hes amazing and really sweet! He gives study guides for every test/quiz that match up perfectly to the actual test/quiz. His powerpoints are long, but he wont have you write down/go over everything in them. He also has multiple extra credit opportunities. TAKE HIM!!!"
8584,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,2085L,5.0,2.0,"Professor Kachlany is a great Professor. He is very organized and breaks down everything that you need to study. Anatomy lab is a tough class, but he gives you great reviews and tells you exactly what you have to study for in the midterm and final exams. Just study all the notes and you will pass."
8585,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085L,4.0,4.0,He is the type of teacher that works well with visual learning students.
8586,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085L,5.0,4.0,His tests are just like his study guides (except the standardized tests). Prepare to read and to spend hrs in the lab studying!
8587,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085L,4.0,1.0,"He was decent, monotone but he was very clear about what to expect on the upcoming quizzes, midterm and final, the packets for the final and midterm were very thick but once you stay consistent and study, even get tutoring like you should, you will absolutely be prepared, dont procrastinate and you will be all set."
8588,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,5.0,2.0,"Hands down best professor I have had , he gives extra credit and study guides, anatomy is not a easy subject but he makes everything so clear and easy. I took him last semester for Bsc2085 with lab and now taking him for bsc2086, definitely taking him next semester for microbiology! Definitely recommend Professor Kachlany sweetest professor ever."
8589,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085L,5.0,3.0,"To pass his class with an A: you really need to study for the midterm and final- dont wait until the end to study- spelling counts, its fairly easy to achieve but if you flunk the midterm from the beginning you wont have many points left to recover it. Out of 300 pts. Hes really chill, easy going, wont ever pick on you."
8590,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,3.0,"Professor Kachlany is super nice and he is very caring, he was a great professor and he has a great sense of humor. His lectures are a little boring but if you try really hard and pay attention you will start to understand. You have to study A LOT on your own in order to pass but i would take him again."
8591,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,3.0,3.0,He is nice but has a very monotone voice so if you have trouble paying attention he isnt for you. Just study the exam reviews a week ahead of the exam and you'll do fine. No other grades except exams.
8592,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010L,5.0,1.0,"Take him! He is a very monotone lecturer, but he is very clear about quizzes and final and midterm!"
8593,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HIM! Lectures can get a little boring just because he has a naturally monotone voice but discussions clear and to the point. AMAZING STUDY GUIDES, his notes are exactly what you are tested on. He will also take time before/after class to discuss with you any topics you're confused on. You can tell he wants his students to do well in his class!"
8594,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors I have ever had. Not trying to trick you.

8595,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,MCB2010L,5.0,4.0,"Prof K is seriously the BEST! He is on the quiet side and his lectures can be a little boring because he is a little monotone but he gives study guides for the 2 quizzes and 2 exams (4 tests make up your grade for this class) that are spot on! as long as you study what he gives you, you will do fine. He's so sweet and nice, I loved him!!!"

The subject is difficult, but he is very caring and provides you with all the information you need. If you put in the work (you will need a lot of studying time), you will definitely pass.

8599,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,5.0,"He is not a bad person, but if we want to talk about the way he teaches, he is not the right teacher. In my class we were the 24 students, after the partial exam, we were only 11. Very sad, some students who were there were very good students."
8600,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,5.0,3.0,"nice guy, easy class. study the powerpoints and you will be fine. he provides a study guide which is nice! i am taking him again for microbiology"
8601,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,5.0,3.0,"I took him for both A&amp;P1 and now A&amp;P2. Great professor Instead of only studying the study guides, he changed it to needing to know all of his powerpoints(as before just more) for the tests. Its more work but still an easy class cause he goes through everything &amp; wont put anything extra on the test that he didnt teach. Super smart guy &amp; super nice!"
8602,1506852,Matthew,Kachlany,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2086,3.0,3.0,He has over 100 slides for one chapter no one on here said that. it be great if someone did. he speaks very low which is hard to hear. i can say hes a good professor its to much time to read over 400 slides for 2-3 chapters. i wish it was 40 slides like every other professors do. but its okay i like the challenge.
8604,1790752,Carlos,Gonzalez,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Anatomy,BSC2085,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, would take again. Lecture heavy , knows what he is talking about. Makes class interesting , not a dull moment in his class. Highly recommend."

8627,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,1.0,"Professor Bush thus far is the best professor I've ever taken. She is very thorough and helpful. Her pop quizzes are not hard at all. In fact,  everyone should pass the quiz. In addition, her Supplemental Instructor, Lulu is the absolute best. She is extremely helpful and understandable. I will say, if you fail the course it is totally your fault."
8628,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1033,4.0,3.0,Sweetest teacher I have ever met. She has a sense of humor. Pop quizzes are given. You do need your textbook and graphing calculator. Tests aren't hard unless you don't study. You have to put in work. She has a tutor Lulu that is only for her class so take advantage!
8629,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"Best math professor ever! She's teaches at a perfect pace, makes you really understand what's going on, has a great student teacher named Lulu that helps you right before tests"
8630,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"She is a easy professor!!! If you do the homework, it will help you on all her tests (Hint Hint).... I would definitely take her again. DON'T miss class because she does give pop quizzes from time to time.... She also gives EXTRA CREDIT... I advise everyone who is in need of taking algebra to take her especially if you HATE math!!!!"
8631,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,3.0,"Not sure how she got such good ratings. She is an overall nice person, but her teaching style isn't that great. She has tough tests, and goes through the notes rather quickly. She makes things harder than they actually are. Every time she explained something I never understood, but then my lab teacher would explain it and I would get it. "
8632,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,Ms. Bush is an overall great person. She's willing to help if you're willing to learn! She go into depth and clearly explains math. If you pay attention in class you will get an A.
8633,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"I personally think her class was easy. Got a high A. For those who aren't good at math I recommend taking her, she explains every and she offer extra credit for every test and drops lowest test. There's about 10 quizzes but there all group quizzes(max 2 questions per quiz!) Most test questions come from homework problems so do the homework!"
8634,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,2.0,"If i could take prof. Bush for my entire college experience, I would. I've never been proficient in math but she makes lessons SO CLEAR AND EASY to understand &amp; goes over problems repeatedly until all students are on the same page. Tests are exactly what she reviews in class, no surprises. Gives extra credit for going to the mathlab."
8635,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"Ms.Bush is great! Math is not my strongest subject, but she teached it in a way that anyone could understand. She is very funny, and very sweet to her students, she is encouraging and she gives you opportunity to do extra credit, although the homework is mandatory she takes those to be the questions to her test. I recommend anyone to take her!"
8636,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"Loved this professor, best college algebra professor at PBSC. Lots of chances for extra credit between the math labs and the random attendence quizzes. She will repeat a problem if you dont understand. Drops lowest test at the end, ended the semester with a high B."
8637,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.5,1.0,"Professor Bush is a great teacher. I have a little bit of a strength in math, but even those who didn't, got good grades. She will repeat things many times if you don't understand, math lab hours give you extra credit on exams, exams are similar to homework, and homework is not graded. I highly recommend."
8638,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"The best college algebra class on campus! You have to try and fail this class. Professor is very clear when teaching material and concepts. There are many opportunities for E.C. and boosting your grade (math lab and quizzes). If you do the assigned hw, tests will be very easy. I studied very little and passed with an A just from doing the hw."
8639,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,Good teacher. I'm really bad at math but she helped me understand the material. Would recommend taking her
8640,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Bush is an excellent professor. She assigns homework; however, it is not graded, only reviewed in class. Many of her quizzes are group quizzes and she occasionally has an attendance quiz. Her tests are fairly short and usually straight from the homework. I honestly thought this class was very easy since I took Trigonometry in high school."
8641,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT2023,4.5,3.0,"I have taken Mrs Bush for both College Algebra, and I am taking her now for Statistics. She assigns homework (but does not check it). It is up to you to do it. The homework will benefit you, because for College Algebra, the tests come form the homework. Go to the lab for 5 points extra credit. Take her if you can!! You wont regret it!!"
8642,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,"Do the homework, ask questions, go to the math lab for 5 extra credit points on each test and you will do well."
8643,142383,Christine,Bush,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.5,2.0,Awesome professor! She made College Algebra easy to understand and gives extra credit if you get help in the math lab or go see her assistant Lulu.  I am so glad I took Christine Bush and I am hoping I can take her for math again.
8645,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,1.0,4.0,"Dropped class the first day. It was remote so we were doing it through blackboard. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. He checks attendance seven times during class, if you are in the bathroom and miss one of those turns he checks; best believe he will count you absent that day. Refuses to record lectures. Hates being asked questions and will not repeat himself"
8646,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,MCB2010,1.0,5.0,"He is absolutely not acceptable and boring, not clear, and very hard to understand."
8647,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,MCB2010,2.0,3.0,"Had high hopes since he's the head of science. I hated this class, not because of the content, but the nature of how this professor goes about things. Boring, acts like any little thing is an inconvenience (emailing him mult. times, etc), and has no time for stupid questions. Would NOT take again or recommend."
8648,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2085,5.0,2.0,Prof. Aviles is one of my favorite professor. He respects every student and expects the same in return. Understand the topic and you'll ace the class. His testing approach is easy which makes sure that you really get the subject not just memorize it. I loved his teaching style. He is very knowledgeable.
8649,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2085L,3.0,4.0,"Theres 2 multiple choice quizzes and 2 practicals. He lectures for the entire class and sometimes we work in groups to review what we learned w the models. He gives lots of extra credit. Sometimes tells you what to study but overall, you're on your own. He's not a bad prof. I just wouldn't recommend to someone who doesn't want to put in the work."
8650,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,I loved Dr. Aviles. He truly knows what hes talking about and provides wonderful examples to explain difficult concepts. I printed off his Power Points for class and this helped me a lot when studying them before tests and quizzes. He is very clear on what is expected. Hes a little monotone but hes such a great professor for this subject
8651,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,AP2085,3.0,3.0,"I took A&amp;P1 with professor Aviles, and struggled so much I had to retake the course. I was skeptical to continue A&amp;P2 with the same professor, but figured it would be easier already have knowing his teaching style. I took A&amp;P2 in a 6week course over the summer and found it to be much easier (as everyone said it would be). STUDY POWER-POINT."
8652,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,5.0,4.0,"These people that gave poor reviews have issues. This man LOVES to teach you and truly wants you to do well. Yes, he lectures heavily and thoroughly. He is very clear about his expectations. This is not a memorization class--you have to learn the concepts to pass the test on them. He is fantastic if you want to truly learn."
8653,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,1.0,4.0,"I do not know how he has so many good reviews.. Honestly, if you are not an overachiever, and don't want to put in day and night for a class, DO NOT TAKE HIM. He thinks you are already in med school, and says you are a disappointment when you don't study before class. save yourself and pick another professor, I wish I had."
8654,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE HIM!! Most uncaring professor I have came across at PBSC! Wouldn't let me reschedule an exam that fell on the day before my grandfather's funeral. EXTREMELY unsympathetic and called a funeral "" a planned event "" so it is an unexcused absence. Lectures until the very last second of class and has a difficult accent to understand."
8655,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,He was a great professor!! Dropped the lowest quiz grade and he goes very slow which is good because it is a lot of material. Lectures are powerpoints and all quizzes and tests are straight from the PowerPoint. The final is the exact questions from the previous quizzes and tests. He wants you to pass.
8656,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,5.0,2.0,"Dr Aviles is not an easy professor, but the truth is: HE WANTS YOU TO LEARN. Take him if you are really interested in learn the content. His tests are a copy of his powerpoints!!!!!!!!! Final exam worth 200 points and are the exact same questions you have in other testes. I took him for AP1&amp;2!"
8657,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2085,5.0,4.0,"I took BSC2085, BSC2085L, BSC2086, BSC2086L, MCB2010, and MCB2010L from Dr. Aviles and got an A+ on all of them. Attend all classess, be ON-TIME, no extra time for late comers. He is very thorough in his lectures. I suggest printing the slides and take notes on the printouts. These subjects are not easy, you need to study hard to get a good grade."
8658,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,1.0,5.0,"Don't take this professor. His tests are suppose to be based off the notes he provides which are as hard to translate as it is to understand what he's saying during the lecture. The notes are all over the place and I had to rewrite them myself in order to even try and study from them. AP2 is already a harder class, don't add the additional stress"
8659,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,AP2085,5.0,1.0,"Dr. Hernan is a great Professor! I had him for A&amp;P 1 I took the lecture and the lab with him was very nice. Some people say hes not this or that, but when you take him youll be just fine. If you go over his PowerPoints, pay attention when he speaks and study even for 30 minutes then you will get a good grade in the class."
8660,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086L,2.0,3.0,"Straightforward class. 12 labs. 2 quizzes, mid term, final. Show up for attendance/participation points. Work done in groups with your lab table. Starts with lecture then each table reviews the info on their own. Nothing special. If your looking for a more ""exciting"" professor then pick another one. This one won't even remember your name."
8661,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,2.0,3.0,"Professor is alright. Not bad, but not the holy grail of professors, either. He talks A LOT in his lectures. So he's your guy if you like to just sit/listen. The amount of quizzes vary due to time issues, I took 5 quizzes and 2 exams. 1 take home exam and the final. No other assignments. 1 extra credit. Not for people who want to be ""engaged"""
8662,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,3.0,5.0,His tests are lecture based so if you miss class its hard to pass the test.
8663,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,1.0,4.0,"Was excited when I picked this teacher because he had overall good grading. Upon the first day I knew it was going to be a challenge. There is no eye contact, no engaging the students and listening to him was like listening to ONE BIG run-on sentence. If you have trouble understanding thick accents then this teacher is not the one for you."
8664,1264037,Hernan,Aviles,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Microbiology,BSC2086,5.0,4.0,"Ive taken A/P 1 and 2, lecture and lab with Dr. Aviles. He is one of the best professors Ive taken. Its really great when people actually care about their job. He demands a lot out of people because they are going into the healthcare field where peoples lives are on the line. He takes that responsibility seriously and I respect him so much."
8666,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1102,5.0,4.0,"AWESOME Professor! Sets the class expectations very clearly. The way he presents his classes is very engaging. Writing is a must in this class, but he truly makes sure you have the right tools to succeed. Quizzes are really easy and he lets you work on them in groups. I would take 100 classes with him."
8667,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Professor gives great feedback on writing and does his best to help. Also, powerpoints and lessons are very engaging."
8668,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"Professor Ehrlich is a great teacher. At the beginning his class seems tough. But with time, and when getting to know him, how his lessons are conducted, everything become easy. he is knowledgeable and always available to help. Plus he answers quickly every concerns, we addressed on remind app (which is a google educational app, users friendly)."
8669,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,This professor has so far been my favorite professor at Palm Beach State. His lectures are fun and easy to follow along with. He talks about the hard subjects in a way that is not too heavy to handle. I loved coming to this class and learning a bunch of fun facts in every class. The workload is not hard to handle.
8670,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,Prof Ehrlich is very much into participation and keeps you awake all class with humor and slides. He is more than fair . Homework isnt crazy and seems to really care about you doing your best .
8671,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,3.0,3.0,"I wouldnt recommend him, if you want to learn English composition. He is heavy on lecturing. If you miss a class session, good luck. He really doesnt like empowering his students. He only give feedback after grading your work. Be ready to write multiple ESSAYS!"
8672,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1102,5.0,2.0,Best Professor Ever for English! Wish there were more classes to take for him as a professor. Learnt so much and his teachings has helped so much throughout college.
8673,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,3.0,"Do not drop his class on the first day! Though he may seem tough on the first day, its just a tactic to get the ones that really want to learn. He is an enthusiastic, dedicated and passionate professor that ultimately really wants the best for his students. He uses funny power points and interesting everyday topics to keep you involved."
8674,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"Amazing professor. Took him for ENC1101 and jumped on the opportunity to take him for ENC1102. My whole friend group from 1101 did the same. Hes hilarious, uses funny powerpoints, and is really understanding to personal issues. Was struggling with some stuff in my personal life and couldnt do my work (mental stuff) he understood and let me do all"
8675,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"If you dont want learn. Dont take his class. I still hear his voice when I hear words like fallacy or civil discourse. I also still sing my multiplication tables from 1st grade. Somethings stick, and Ehrlichs rhetoric is one of them."
8676,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,"This guy is super genuine and funny, and you really learn a lot in this class. Hes one of the few professors that keeps materials interesting and actually cares. He wants nothing more for you to pass and get the grade you deserve. Would definitely suggest taking him!"
8677,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,This teacher is an amazing professor. His class is so entertaining and he is just hilarious! Dont take this class if youre sensitive to jokes about things such as politics. Hes very knowledgeable about everything. GRAMMAR IS IMPORTANT TO HIM! He is amazing. 10/10 would take his class again.
8678,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1102,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Ehrlich is a really wonderful professor. He's extremely knowledgeable in just about any topic. His classes are entertaining and engaging. You will learn A LOT. I personally took him during summer so the work load was hefty, but I enjoyed the work he gave us. He really cares about his students and it shows. I loved his class."
8679,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1102,4.0,4.0,"Take this professor if you are open-minded about political issues! His class is so entertaining and his Powerpoints are one of the best I've ever seen a teacher do. Please do not fool around because this class is a lot of work especially during the summer. For ENC1102, a 12-15 page essay is required. So PLEASE start early! Overall, amazing teacher!"
8680,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,Mr. Ehrlich was awesome. I highly recommend. He does give quite a few essay assignments but they are fairly easy-he just wants to see what kind of writer you are. He always gives you a chance to fix your essays after he leaves comments. He definitely cares if you're actually learning and makes class interesting. Taking him for ENC1102!!
8681,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,2.0,5.0,"Took Professor Ehrlich for ENC1101 has not been easy. More than 13 essays and research. I thought that this teacher would be my teacher in 1102, but I was disappointed. He gave too many rehearsals/assignments in just 6 weeks. One self-sufficient person, mediocre, liar, .. never make extra credit work, because will not receive any points."

8683,263418,Richard,Ehrlich,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Literature,ENC1101,2.0,5.0,HE SPEAKS A LOT AND EXPLAINS LITTLE. HE NEEDS TO FOCUS MORE IN WHICH TOPICS WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT. MUCH POWER POINTS AND NOTHING VERY IMPORTANT.

8704,485050,Kathleen,Bey,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,ENC1101L,1.5,1.0,Easiest class ever. Doesn't look at work just ask for your total grade. You don't ever have to go to class. If you want an easy A then pick her.
8705,485050,Kathleen,Bey,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,1.0,"While I initially didn't enjoy this class, I ate my words at the completion of the semester. It was very informative, fun, and easy. She provides a clear outline for every chapter and specifically highlights what will be on the tests. In addition to her study guides, she always reviews the entire test beforehand. I will miss this class. "
8707,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,5.0,Dont recommend him for trig. Didn't know how to teach and would get mad whenever someone asked him a question. He was always rude.
8708,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,4.0,"Prof. Pick's tests are NOT multiple choice which was difficult for me. Homework and three exams with a final; you can ONLY use your notes for the final exam. I like how we use the TI-84 calculators for the course; it's literally a short cut from doing those hard formulas. If your horrible at studying and non-muliple choice tests, dont take him."
8709,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,4.0,This class was so well-organized and easy! He tells you what is on the test. The key is to read his lessons and do the practice questions. All the answers are in the book. He also responds quickly to e-mails if you need help with a concept. He clearly outlines how to solve the questions using the technology (StatCrunch). The Exams are fair!
8710,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,4.0,"College is not easy. It's a lot of hard work. So, about Professor Pick, he is just doing his job. I respect him despite of the bad reviews he'd received. He's always on time. He's always ready to teach. You must passed &amp; understand other math subjects before taking this class or you will not have a clue what's going on."
8711,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,2.0,5.0,"This professor was nice and he taught the material in an understandable way, but he did not give students a chance to get better grades he would just tell us to read the notes. His tests were difficult if you didn't fully grasp the lecture. He also would make us stay after tests for a 45 minute lecture."
8712,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,4.0,his bad attitude comes from lack of patience and frustration with students . In a nutshell the class is laid out from the home work to the online supplementary handouts to the online test reviews and extra practice. For this class you must review your notes regularly if not daily. Most do not know how to properly study or do not keep up and drop
8713,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,1.0,"Professor Pick is very straightforward with the course learning outcomes at least for STA2023. I took his class in 2017 and the tests and practice materials were on his page on PBSC to study for. If you're not very good at math, make sure to study for his exams, go over the examples, and ask him questions DURING the lecture or he won't answer."
8714,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"The most unhelpful teacher I've ever encountered. My class started with about 18 people, by the end of the semester I was one of 6. I would not recommend this professor too anyone that is trying to learn math, he has zero patience and respect for the PROCESS of learning!"
8715,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,"by far hardest prof ever. I suggest you take another prof if you want to pass. He is available after class in his office hours (sometimes), the time on his syllabus did not match his actual office hours. material was hard, and he did not make it easier."
8716,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,SAT2023,1.0,5.0,WORST PROFESSOR EVER.
8717,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,SAT2023,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE HIM. WELL IF YOU WANT TO FAIL GO AHEAD.
8718,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,4.0,"A very interesting teacher, Prof. Pick is very tough and at times can seem very very rude. His attitude is what turns the majority of people off and causes them to become disinterested in the material. If you can, however, get over his attitude he's a very good teacher and is very knowledgeable about his topic and goes into great detail."
8719,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,2.0,"This is a class to just get through. Professor gets off on yelling at students and making them feel less than. Homework is easy, tests arent bad (as long as you take notes).. its just dealing with his horrible attitude. This man just loves to bully students. Always uses the phrase ""unbelievable"" in a sarcastic, derogatory manor. Be happy :)"
8720,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATT1033,4.0,2.0,"He's very solid when it comes to teaching. His test is what you take notes on, and if you are unsure about what he taught in class, you're more than welcome to practice on the MyMathLab. If you can achieve an 80 - 90% on my math lab, you'll easily achieve the same grade as his test. If anything, MyMathLab is harder."
8721,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATT1033,1.0,5.0,"If math is not your best subject, do not take this professor! He is very difficult and his tests seem almost impossible to pass."
8722,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,4.0,3.0,"Very patient, funny and chill teacher. A lot of notes, and online homework on my mathlab. As long as you keep up with homework and do the reviews before tests the class isnt hard. He teaches a bit fast pace but he is very patient with his students and answers many questions in class, as long as you arent scared to ask any."
8723,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,2.0,"Professor Pick is very clear on his expectations. That being said, I would not recommend taking him if you do not have a solid foundation in algebra. If you don't understand what he's saying, ask him then and there or else he won't want to answer it later."
8724,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,SAT2023,1.0,5.0,"if Youre not the best at math and youve never been in a statistic class please do not take this teacher. He is very difficult, he answers every question with sarcasm and pretty much tells you that its in your notes. His test are hard I am not exaggerating. Hes rude and pretty much makes the class uncomfortable. I wish i Never took his class."
8725,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,4.0,"This is not just a math class. This professor requires a lot of participation in discussions (way too much writing for math). You are self taught. Read the book (which doesn't help) and do the homework. Everything that I learned I googled and got off of you tube, even had to go as far as getting a tutor and I love math."
8726,881105,Joseph,Pick,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,4.0,Teacher was so rude. I almost cried on my first day of class. He made me feel so stupid in front of the whole class. Cannot ask him questions. He will call students out and embarrass them. I feel very uncomfortable in this class. He acts like a know it all. He thinks his way is always right. I would never recommend this teacher.
8728,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,"I learned tons about myself and our society. I really enjoyed his pre-recorded lectures, but you don't actually have to listen to them to get an A, you just have to do the assigned reading. I liked all of the reading and writing that was required."
8729,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,4.0,4.0,"I took this course online over the summer. It consisted of two 600 word discussion posts a week, two quizzes a week, one 6 page book report, and a huge 10 page paper. He really makes you work for an A. Dont take him if youre looking for an easy A! Hes great and very well educated, but certainly hard to please! I got an A, but worked very hard!"
8730,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,4.0,3.0,Get ready to write! Great professor though
8731,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY2361,1.0,5.0,"I didn't trust these reviews bc I thought these people were just over exaggerating. This is the hardest class I have ever taken in my life. I thought 6 papers wouldn't be that bad, but when you have other classes its impossible. I hate him so much. No feedback or PROMPTS!!! HE DOESNT GIVE PROMPTS FOR HIS PAPERS! HE JUST TELLS YOU TO WRITE THEM BRUH"
8732,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,4.0,4.0,"I learned soo much about society and why people do the things they do from this class. The coursework is interesting. Professor Asif is a tough grader, but he lets you know what your paper lacked. He gives good feedback, he grades quickly and is very responsive. I'll be taking him for SYG2361 next semester and am looking forward to it. Take him!"
8733,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,"Although he gives weekly assignment and makes you read, the class was interesting and all he is looking for is cooperation from the student. As long as you do your homework and the 10 question/1 hour times test which are super easy, you should be fine. Home and test are super easy. two long reports are also submitted."
8734,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2361,3.0,4.0,"I took Professor Raza for Death and Dying online. Never missed an assignment worked by butt off and still got a B. . The final paper was a visit to a cemetery , he said "" great paper would have been better with pictures"" How disrespectful to the dead to have some random person snapping pictures of graves :("
8735,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG1000,4.0,4.0,"Not bad. I learned a lot from this class. As long as you read the books, you will do well. The only thing is, it's nearly impossible to get a perfect score on any of the discussions and papers. It's almost as if this professor is not allowed to give perfect scores."
8736,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,4.0,He is an easy prof. Do the readings before class because you will have a quiz on them and they set up the lesson for the week. The material can be really interesting so the lectures are not always a pain and make you want to participate. If you want to learn/work then take this class. There are essays but they're super easy to complete. Just read
8737,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,4.0,"He is seriously one of my favorite professors ever, i took his Introduction to Sociology class and from the first day i knew he was such a good guy. We do have to work for our grade, there is a ten question quiz almost every wed. for the reading assigned but if you read ur good. Syllabus explains everything and he cares for his students!"
8738,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,2.0,3.0,He isn't clear on what it is that he wants specifically and will change things without notice. Apparently you don't need to present your social problem report although he puts it in the syllabus. The students who didn't present didn't get any points off and the ones who did didn't get extra points. I wouldn't take his class again.
8739,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,5.0,4.0,"I loved Dr. Raza, I thought he was an excellent professor. I took 2 Sociology classes online with him. There is a lot of writing, I did not agree with 100% of the material used. If it helps, he wants to know how you feel. He wants that to reflect in your writing. He clearly communicated his expectations. His Death &amp; Dying class was awesome"
8740,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY1000,1.0,4.0,Does not give good feedback and if it your first time using blackboard dont take his class if you submit something the wrong way he doesnt care he says make sure it doesnt do it again Stated that you can rarely receive 10/10 on assignments but doesnt tell you how to improve.
8741,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2361,1.0,1.0,I will never take this course ever again. He is very rude he does not accept work not even a day late he does not care about his students at all. He does not give any feedback or terrible feedback. he is horrible!
8742,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,1.0,5.0,"he is no good, no feedback on works. bad showing where assignments at. just a bad professors all around. do not take any of his classes."
8743,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SGY1000,4.0,3.0,I had him online and he required us to answer questions 300 words each. Do every wee we submit 1200 words . He has two papers. One 6page book report on $2 a day. The other one is a 8 page research paper. The stories could get a bit weird sometimes but I enjoyed them.
8744,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,4.0,Make sure you quote the authors framework when answering the question Dr. Asif Raza ask during thread and essay lessons.
8745,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2010,1.0,4.0,"DO NOT TAKE!! He is a tough grader!! He doesn't give you any feed back on the discussions/papers for the class. He doesn't give feed back on why he deducted points. This is the only ""B"" I have in my college transcripts. I took this class online, submitted the work on time and still wasn't enough. the worst part is that I didn't know what I did wrong"
8746,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,"Never expected to learn as much as I did from this class. Prof. Raza is extremely knowledgeable and unbiased. Unlike most humanity professors, Prof. Raza truly inspires students to think from a brand new point of view. He has to be ""the center of attention"" at all times, so be sure to listen and make eye contacts with him instead of going on phones"
8747,1004462,Asif,Raza,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Sociology,SYG2000,5.0,3.0,"Amazing Profesor, Took him for three subjects. He truly cares about his studnets and gives amazing lectures. Gives great feedback and always accessible via email. If you are lazy stay away. Great professor and I highly recommend to anyone who needs these courses,"
8749,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,RUN! take my advice please. She is very very very rude and only respects students who have prior knowledge of the subject. If you ask her to explain it is like a bother. Math is already hard but her attitude makes math harder.
8750,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1020,1.0,4.0,Had her for college algebra last year. She is rude and needs to retire. She just gives out a bunch of homework and expects you to multitask everything. basically she thinks the world revolves around her.
8751,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0010,1.0,4.0,Terrible. God awful. Her voice is annoying and she reminds me of Mrs. Frizzle from the magic school bus. Literally makes things much more difficult than it needs to be. She sucks.
8752,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1033C,2.0,5.0,"AS A STUDENT THAT HAS TAKEN HER CLASS ALREADY. My best advice TO NOT TAKE HER CLASS unless you are moderate at math! She make you feel so ASHAMED if you answer a question wrong. Worst teacher ever! The students that are saying that she is good are students that were already good at math. If she is the only math teacher left, WAIT FOR NEXT SEMESTER"
8753,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0010,5.0,1.0,I absolutely LOVE Professor Lashway. At first when I picked her and came on here to see other students feedback on her I was kind of skeptical because I didn't see the best views on her. She is such an amazing professor and I'm so glad I went through with keeping her as my professor. She GENUINELY cares about her students. RECOMMEND 10000%
8754,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"loved her i took her for two semesters and she really cares about her students and how you do, makes you work hard but is super helpful all around. great teacher!!"
8755,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,4.0,"Very rude and hurtful. If you are not good at math, she will purposefully embarrass you and make you feel worthless. She yells, slams doors , calls names, and is very belligerent. She is a narcissist at its finest and not a supportive instructor, if anything she is abusive and a liability to palm beach. She creates an impossible environment. RUNNN!"
8756,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,I cant explain how good of a caring teacher she is. All semester if she sees you are working hard and putting in the work shell do anything in her power to have you succeed. The way she teaches is great. Gives reviews basically like the test. I suggest you take her
8757,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,4.0,"Wasn't good at math, but made sure we understood the material. Online homework on MyMathLab 4 every chapter that is due b4 test days. Gives a quiz at the beginning of class every day which I found annoying at 1st but helped me understand the material better. Wants a physical txtbook. Dont take if not expecting to do work. Cares for students."
8758,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1105,5.0,3.0,"She is my favorite teacher by far, never had someone care so much for my success. I see bad reviews here and honestly she can be strict at times, but warm up to her &amp; give her a chance! Actually get to know her &amp; show her you care, she is an amazing, uplifting teacher! Wouldn't have made it through this semester without her. I am going to miss her!"
8759,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT001,3.0,1.0,She can be a little harsh and assuming sometimes but it's okay and expected. All professor are the same.
8760,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1035,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT , I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! DROP THE CLASS IF YOU HAVE PICKED IT UP. WASTE OF TIME, SHE IS SUPER RUDE WITH NO RESPECT Find another professor that actually genuinely cares or can pretend to care about your grade or knowledge in order to pass..."
8761,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"Will tell you, you are going to pass the class no problem. Until the final &amp; supposedly you need a 98% just to pass the class."
8762,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,3.0,"Mrs. Lashway changed my life! I was so upset about what she said to me about what I can do. I wouldn't have been the A math student I am today if it wasn't for her speech. It makes me tear up just thinking about how much I grew from this class. To sum up this professor: Overly caring, enthusiastic and she likes you to do formulas her way."
8763,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,4.0,"Mrs Lashway is incredible! There are a few things that are very important to her. This is participation, come to class prepared, be on time, do not miss class, do not go on your phone, do all your required homework when she tells you to, and do not interrupt the lecture. I'm taking her again this semester, she is the best. You get what YOU put in!!"
8764,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,1.0,5.0,"After 4 weeks of being disrespected by my teacher. I spoke to her after class, where I told her how difficult she has been making this class for me. She cried and apologized to me and treated me like a saint the last two weeks of class. I have no idea what sparked her treating me like this. Maybe I cut her off before class in the parking lot, Idk?"
8765,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,1.0,5.0,Then I was banned from receiving help from the si. Which made this class almost impossible. While everyone else was sitting in the leisure of there seat I had to walk to ms lash way for help basically the person whos embarrassed me in front of this class mulitple times while I have a herniated disk. The only person who wasn' allowed to use the si.
8766,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,1.0,5.0,"Then a week later I asked her for help and she said my notes weren't there. Then I showed her my notes were there and she commented back ""I CANT ARGUE WITH A KID GO BACK TO YOUR SIT"" for simply asking her for help for a stupid math problem, she responds like that in front of the whole class. Then after this I was banned from getting help from th si"
8767,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,1.0,5.0,"As I stood up to move my sit once again, I stood up and said I was using my calculator and that was the si instructor talking to her. As I had to switch sits which ruins my comfortability over accusations that i wasn't doing. She mouthed off that I always talk back to her and this isn't middle school."
8768,842221,Mary,Lashway,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,1.0,1.0,After that class I addressed it to her and she said I should work on my social abilities but let me move back to my original sit. So then third week in she calls me out and says Im using my phone when I was using the calculator and then thought I was talking to the girl next to me when that was the si instructor talking to her. As I speak back to
8770,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"This professor is by far the rudest teacher at palm beach state, hes always been like this. Doesnt Review homework or tests, sarcastic, has a temper, insult students and always in a rush."
8771,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147MAC2311,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor, bad at teaching, does not answer emails, make terrible tests with little time to do and extreme amount of homework. He was the only professor available for my summer class and thats why I decided to take even tho I had seen bad ratings here. Do not take this professor you will regret."
8772,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2311,3.0,4.0,"There are no reviews for any of the tests. Once we finish going over the material, test next class. We just have to study what we learned with no idea of what to pay closer attention to. The final was even worse. After our last test, he said that the next time we would meet will be for the final. Again. No review and we had to just study everything"
8773,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"He really is such a nice man and wants the best for his students. In order to do well, do the homework, study, listen to his lectures, and participate. He inspires his students to do well in school to have a better life and learn. Very funny and is one of the best professors to have for math."
8774,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,4.0,"Extremely funny. Although you have to make the effort in his class. You have to pay attention, he knows how to teach very well, but just prepare for his sarcasm. He is very straight forward with his lessons and makes everything look simple. Also have to do the hw because they help for the tests."
8775,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"Considering the fact that im already HORRIBLE at math &amp; sitting in an intermediate class to get help so I am ready for college algebra, HE CONFUSES ME EVEN MORE THAN I WAS TO BEGIN WITH. Very sarcastic, makes jokes about the class being a intermediate course, and if you dont understand something hell make you seem dumb for not understanding."
8776,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,I would rather stand in the middle of 1-95 then to ever take his class !! He grades super hard and does not give extra credit !
8777,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,4.0,5.0,"He's not too bad, honestly. He is definitely a tough grader, and he rarely gives extra points. He also has a habit of getting off topic a lot so if that bothers you then you might want to stay away."
8778,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2313,4.0,3.0,Expects you to recall the theorems and intuition from previous calculus classes. Can you believe that? (Sarcasm.) Professor Gordon provides great conceptual explanations and works out the problems in class. His tests come straight out of the homework. He also provides you with formula sheets for the loaded sections. Take him if you want to learn.
8779,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2313,1.0,5.0,Worst math professor I've taken at PBSC. Great at math but a terrible teacher. He jokes around in class and does not clearly explain any of the material. If you don't remember everything you've learned up to this point do not take Gordon. He doesnt give any partial credit and could care less about his students. Literally take anyone else
8780,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,2.0,Professor Gordon is the best math teacher at pbsc. If you don't know how to solve 2x4 then dont take his class. He teaches at a higher level then other professors and he will not baby you. Learned a lot from him.

8786,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,4.0,"If you want to learn learn, he is the professor to go. Do understand that he will be teaching at a higher level than every other professor. Not because he wants to torture, but because he cares about your future as the next leaders in the world. He will explain if you need help, and he does offer extra credit. Great Professor."

If youre confused about something, make sure to say something because he will not stop to make sure you understand. Took him for calculus with Analytic Geometry 2 and I did well. I believe he has prepared me for when I transfer."
8788,863879,Jermaine,Gordon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,4.0,"So I took Calculus with Analytical Geometry 2 Fall semester 2018, IT WAS HARD. It wasn't Gordon's fault, Calc 2 is just extremely difficult, unless you have a terrible professor. Gordon was an amazing professor, and he tells you how to prepare for the tests. DO HOMEWORK, READ THE BOOK!Curves tests, gives extra credit. Hard class, amazing professor."

8791,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AHM2020,4.0,4.0,"Took his class remotely. Most of the work is done outside out of class, which mainly consists of PPT notes, easy writing assignments &amp; reading the textbook (which is free online but not really needed). Hes very nice &amp; will help anyone if they need it. Not too hard of a class, just take good notes of his PPTs lectures (which are long) &amp; you'll pass."

I'm not someone who liked history but Professor Smith made it interesting with his lectures. It was never a boring class, he loves to talk about history. The book is technically required but I found that the lectures makes up 95% of the tests. Take good notes and pay attention. Very little hw. I would take him again!"
8794,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,3.0,TAKE HIM!!! he is an amazing professor and is truly passionate about teaching history. this class made me love history and become so interested in it. he is so kind and genuinely wants his students to do well. you learn SO much from his lectures he's very knowledgeable and thorough. take good notes and study and you will definitely get an A.
8795,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AHM2020,4.0,2.0,This professor is one of the most passionate professors in the school. He is very lecture heavy but it is worth it because he has so much enthusiasm that it helps the class stay together. His homework is incredibly easy and the test are from the notes. This class is an easy A
8796,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,4.0,3.0,"prof smith really cares about history and you can tell as soon as he starts talking. This class is really lecture heavy, so if you skip you won't pass the class also his test is 95% of his lectures so make sure that you take good notes and study before every test if you do that you will pass"
8797,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AHM2020,4.0,5.0,"You can read the book from cover to cover but if you don't pay attention to the minor details, you will fail. He is a great professor but his tests are the hardest things on earth."
8798,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AHM2020,1.0,4.0,"Lectures every class, doesn't give study guides, tests cover over 300 pages of text and no study structure is presented hard to be ready for a test when you have no specific chapter references."
8799,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AHM2020,5.0,3.0,"Amazing guy, loves his job very much and teaches very well. 95% of the class is taking notes, gives a couple homework assignments where you define something. Pretty much all of your grade is your tests though so do not skip class and seriously study your notes. would recommend reviewing notes after every class because theres a lot you will forget"
8800,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,4.0,3.0,"I took him for US history 1865-Present, and he was a great teacher for me since I'm fascinated with History. For others I can see where he can be a bit boring since his lectures take up 90% of the class time, but you can tell he really likes his job and the subjects at hand. I wish there was more work outside of the tests though."
8801,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,4.0,3.0,He's your basic professor lectures till class is over and leaves. If you do have to miss a class then FIND SOMEONE to give you the notes. If not when you take the test you'll be confused on a large section of it.
8802,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,4.0,I took professor Smith spring 2018. One of the best teachers I have ever had. He is very lecture heavy but you can tell he is excited about what he teaches and wants everyone to succeed. The book is recommended but honestly not necessary to have. You have one group project at the end of the semester. I would take him again in a heart beat!
8803,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,HIST2010,1.0,5.0,This the class where you learn all this information and only have 5% of it be on the test. Do not get this teacher you will have to work your ass off to pass. The whole semester grades are 4 exams thats it no extra work to help. Nothing. Hes no help either so be aware.
8804,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED this professor! He loved what he was teaching, so it made it interesting. You don't need to read if you showed up, took good notes, and understood the material. Only has the tests and one or two assignments, so you need to study for the tests."
8805,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,4.0,3.0,If you come in with a decent foundation in American history the class shouldn't be a problem. Tests are entirely based off of the lecture which is convienient. Just make sure to take good notes (you also have the option to record if you need to). His lectures are long but he manages to keep you engaged and laugh every now and then.
8806,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,5.0,4.0,"Great professor that's very kind and respectable to all. Lots of good lectures, for upcoming tests (3-4 chapters in a test). Little homework, so doing good on the tests is a must. Tough class, but I would take it again. I learned a lot and liked professor Smith ( :"
8807,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AHM2020,5.0,3.0,"this teacher, is one of the best teachers i have ever had. not to much homework but definitely study! tests are multiple choice, and mostly go off of his lectures. Record the class and take notes off of what he says and you will do fine. If you aren't prepared to take the test, tell him and he will let you take it another time! awesome teacher"
8808,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,3.0,4.0,Very nice professor its a very hard class1 To do well you must study non stop. Only 3 tests barely any extra credit to boost your grade if you fail a test. His test questions are multiple choice BUT aren't easy and do not come directly from his lectures. If you have a chance to take another professor I would unless you like a challenge..
8809,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,1.0,5.0,Only teacher I have ever had a problem with out of my two years of school. His test questions are not accurate to what he will tell you to read. Staying after class for questions is a joke. I do not understand how he is teaching. If it requires waiting until another semester avoid him at all cost.
8810,362693,Sean,Smith,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,4.0,4.0,"(US History to 1865). Friendly, very smart, teaches with depth, makes it interesting. He never bored me. Very little homework. Textbook is unnecessary. VERY test-heavy. You MUST attend lectures and take notes. Course isn't hard; just a lot of info to remember. I'm usually an A student and I got B's in this class. Still, it's all good."
8812,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,4.0,2.0,"Literally shocked at some of these comments. MR Q-C is great!. One paper, some open book stuff, a little studying for quizzes and exams and an A should be a piece of cake. He sent us reminders before anything was due, uses great examples in class of political stuff. I was dreading this class but now I'm going to take his other class."
8813,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,5.0,3.0,He can off as rough but he's actually really nice. He wants to help you and he wants you to pass. It's a bit difficult at first but it gets better. He explains everything well and will make sure you understand.
8814,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,4.0,2.0,he definitely sets high expectations at the begining of the semester and eases up as the semester goes on. I kinda needed that. Gives reminders for exams and quizzes. Very passionate and not biased which is nice.
8815,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,5.0,2.0,Gives a lot of opportunities to do well. Great class. Learned a lot!
8816,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,3.0,5.0,Due to covid I ended up having to take his class online and it was really difficult. I feel like he purposely made the quizzes and test difficult just because he thought that many people would be cheating. He made it really hard to pass his class.
8817,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,5.0,"Prof Mancusi does not play around. His class is difficult with a lot reading and the book was no help at all for the quizzes. There's 3 tests that are difficult and one term paper (2,000 words) that he will grade harshly. This class was ridiculous and would not take again!"
8818,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,3.0,"Absolutely the worst Professor I've ever had, wants student's participation but scolds them at the same time. Got to use the restroom? Prepare to get an F for attendence for turning your camera off. Also absolutely unorganized."
8819,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,5.0,1.0,"He does come off a lot meaner than he bans out to be, he definitely made learning American government interesting while not being basis is any of the topics which I really appreciated. Gives material and attendance points no extra credit but test are super straight forward study and u will do great"
8820,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,5.0,1.0,He's really passionate about his teaching. If you simply follow his syllabus then trust you WILL pass ! Don't forget to study also :).
8821,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,4.0,"By far the worst Professor I have had, he is very condescending if you ask a question, thinks he knows everything under the sun, and do not even try to contradict him. He lectures about current events not on PPTs you will have to teach yourself, and his tests are hard. Overall just not someone you want to have to see/deal with on a weekly bases."
8822,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,4.0,"He makes you participate in his class, it is mandatory to be in his class and to be on time. You have to study hard to pass his tests and he doesnt accept late papers."
8823,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,3.0,4.0,"Like someone else said this is a self-taught class. If you don't test well skip him. Two 1,000 word writing assignments, 3 textbook assessments, 3 quizzes, and 4 exams. He spends most of his lectures discussing current events &amp; not slides. Print the slides out and study on your own because you will need it. He is funny though so hes got that going."
8824,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Mancusi's class was well organized! All his quizes and tests require only memorization so study. There were 3 quizzes, 2 1000 word essays which were easy, 4 exams, and 3 in-class assessments. Attendance is very important because it counts as a grade as well. You honestly have to be dedicated to the class in order to pass so study study study!"
8825,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,5.0,"Do not take him, and you will thank me later."
8826,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,1.0,Do not take him if you need your GPA.
8827,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,2.0,"Easy class as far as grading. Little to no room for discussion in his lecturing style, especially if you disagree with his opinion on something. 98% of what you learn will be through online quizzes. Would not recommend. Far better educators out there."
8828,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,5.0,"Please skip him, trust me, thanks to me later!"
8829,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,1.0,4.0,"He's, in 1 word, unprofessional. He tries to be fun and a hard a at the same time. You can get to the course materials, but you'll have to get it off his personal(ad) real estate website. Extra credit can only be found on his facebook if you friend him. He's passive aggressive, he'll compliment you 1 second and berate you the next. -&gt;Do not take&lt;-"
8830,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,3.0,3.0,"Never responded to emails, you get a bad grade, thats final. USE THE QUIZLETS HE GIVES YOU its lowkey a self taught class, was my first semester, wouldnt suggest for someone who doesnt know the ways of college yet least fav teach of the semester"
8831,1028782,Phillip,Mancusi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Political Science,POS1041,3.0,4.0,"He thinks any movement during a test is you trying to cheating, his test are hard so get ready to study a lot. DO NOT EVEN TRY TO CHEAT! He comes off extremely arrogant but I can say he is very knowledgeable about government. I could of gotten an A had I studied longer for my first test. As the semester goes on it gets a bit easier. Good Luck."
8833,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,2.0,Probably one of the best professors you will ever have. He makes written lectures that contain everything you need to know so do not worry about buying the book. Super fun and passionate about history.

8836,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,5.0,3.0,"Professor Dillon is great, loves his lectures. The only thing that was challenging in his class , is the 15 minute timed quizzes. If you are a person who stress over timed test, this will be your only issue, but you will survive! One paper. He answers emails promptly. Overall excellent professor, He makes you want to learn more about history."
8837,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,2.0,"Prof Dillon is awesome ! He is knowledgeable and cares about your well being in the class. He gives 4 quizzes, 1 paper, midterm, &amp; final. He drops the lowest quiz. If you study the lectures you'll do great on the quizzes and exams. Paper was 3 pages double spaced so pretty short. I would take him again! Take this class if you need it!"
8838,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2010,5.0,1.0,"Handful of quizzes a midterm and a final and one paper. After that you are done. You don't need a textbook, his lectures are very informative, write down good notes and you will be fine. He makes it interesting and if you study from your notes, I knew people who struggled in his class and their studying material wasn't up to par."
8839,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,4.0,Profession Dillion is an excellent history professor. His lectures are interesting and he brings stories into them. I picked him because of the reviews on rate my professor and I'm glad I did. I truly enjoyed his class. He allowed late students to submit makeup work and gives ex-credit assignments.
8840,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,1.0,"You don't need the textbook, he explains everything. Some concepts are dull, others are intriguing. He explains it in a way where you can understand it. I really like that. I recommend going over your notes every night. If you do that the class is easy. No home work, couple quiz's and one paper. Really great teacher, will be taking again."
8841,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,4.0,3.0,"I took this course online, it was easy to get done throughout the week but if you didn't study the lectures (which are actually quite interesting for someone who is not interested in reading about history) you will not do well on tests/quizzes. The tests are on a large number of sections so try and keep up! He was hard to reach via email though."
8842,1380068,Rodney,Dillon,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),History,AMH2020,5.0,2.0,"I am by any means a history person but Professor Dillon is a very passionate, respectful, joyful, overall good classic kind of guy who likes things old fashioned and simple, he loves what he does and i actually found myself listening most of the time which shocked myself, he offers extra credit, he wants you to succeed and love his class."

Just take good notes or get them from someone if you miss class. Make flashcards. I got an A in the summer accelerated course which was tough just because of super long classes and lots of info in a short time, but not unreasonable. Tests are fairly easy. Didn't use the book."

8863,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1101,2.0,4.0,This teacher has no sympathy for students canceled class multiple times in the semester and changes schedules and due dates multiple time in the semester leaving students confused you might as well take her class online because you only go to class to talk about the assignment and when its due no help on how to do it . i would not recommend
8864,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,LIT1000,4.0,2.0,I took her online class before reading her RMP reviews. It made me nervous about her grading but I passed the class with an A. Despite the discouraging reviews. Professor Fine provides clear grading instructions for each assignment rubric. Follow the instructions to the T and you will be able to pass with an A. Do not do the bare minimum!
8865,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,LIT1000,1.0,5.0,"Professor Africa Fine assigned a literature book in which many of the readings are grammatically incorrect! The written English is very bad and it is not what I would call English of the ""common people."" This class is horrendous and I would suggest if you really want to learn a thing or two and further your education, never take a class with her!"
8866,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,LIT1000,1.0,5.0,The worst professor ever! Need this class to graduate and no luck of passing. She does not care if your 2 seconds late its an automatic zeroooo! She wants every word in your reading responses to be yours words only so she takes a great amount of time to submit graded because of that. I would rather take an 8 hour class on campus before her.
8867,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,LIT1000,1.0,5.0,PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU NEED THIS CLASS TO GRADUATE.
8868,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,AML2600,1.0,5.0,Do not take her class she does not take points off for being one minute late.

8870,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,If you are looking to learn do not take this course!
8871,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,LIT1000,1.0,3.0,This professor does not care about her students in the slightest. Her grading scale seems to be random and provides zero feedback unless you explicitly ask her about it -- and even then it seems like she copy pastes her answers from a previously made up document of responses. She accepts zero late submissions even if they are a legitimate reason.
8872,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,LIT1000,1.0,4.0,"HORRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE. I submitted an assignment an HOUR after the deadline and she still gave me a ZERO, she's awful and not understanding at all. Her assignments are stupid and the assigned reading is boring and awful literature. I wish I could withdraw because I missed 2 assignments and she would not let me submit even barely a day later."
8873,1463283,Africa,Fine,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),English,LIT1000,3.0,4.0,"I took Professor Fine for ENC 1102. I worked really hard and earned an A. For LIT 1000, I worked really hard and got an A as well. She responds very quickly to emails and available for office ours. That being said TAKE ADVANTAGE. She will always help you and wants you to do well and become a college level writer."
8875,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,5.0,This professor consisted of hours of work each week. It was not that hard but it was VERY time consuming.
8876,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,If youre not good at math DONT take her class!! She moves super fast expecting you to know what youre doing. Doesnt teach how to solve problems just makes you figure it out. She says to ask questions but when you ask she makes you feel dumb. I wouldnt recommend if youre slow either. Shes really strict always serious.
8877,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,2.0,"I am not the strongest at math, however professor rose made this class manageable and the fact that it was online I felt like i was on campus. Her assignments were understandable and it aided with the learning process. I got a B because i missed a test due to family emergency. she also gave a chance to redo some assignments with a mark reduction"
8878,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,5.0,"She uses the MathLab which is very heavy on homework, quizzes, practice test AND regular testsits just an insane amount of work. a lot of work for a prof that is counting on software that grades everything for hermade it easy on her but hard on her students. The only good thing is that the homework gives you multiple chances to fix your score"
8879,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Professor Wilson is direct but not hands on. The lectures are in MyMathLab and from the 90s so the videos are weird. I would recommend a tutor because I needed one for some of it. The quizzes and tests are all online and she drops the worst test and worst quiz. You have weekly homework, quizzes, later practice test. Better than a bad professor."
8880,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,1.0,5.0,I would say dont take her she is so mean and docent care what your going through
8881,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,4.0,4.0,"Professor Wilson has a clear outline of test dates and she usually sticks by them, her lectures can be confusing at times, but her office hours are very accessible and shes very kind. It's not an easy class and you need to work for your grade, but she does equip you well, do the homework and test review and you should honestly be fine."
8882,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,4.0,"Professor Wilson is so knowledgable. This course is difficult but she is always there to help when needed. She has a clear schedule, which clearly states when the homework is due, and when there are quizzes or tests. She is really nice and will help and can clarify information very well. I would 100% take her again."
8883,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1103,3.0,4.0,As an intermediate class for algebra she doesnt help you learn at all. She rushes through her lessons just to put you in groups with other students that dont know what to do either. Dont plan on missing any class otherwise you will get zeros in the grade book. Also if you ask her questions in class she makes you seem dumb for not knowing.
8884,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,2.0,4.0,It was easy for me because math is my best subject. For someone who isn't that good at math this class isn't the right fit. She goes through lessons way too quick. She makes it seem and feel like she hates her job. Many students are too scared to ask for help and she looks at you like your stupid if you saying you don't understand something.
8885,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,3.0,2.0,"She is VERY repetitive when she teaches new material. A lot of group work, if you do not like working in groups do not take her. You need the textbook really for the code but she does problems in the book but very little and will tell you to bring it everyday. Overall class is easy just show up and learn."
8886,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,1.0,1.0,this class is basically figuring it out on your own. She doesn't even use her own videos to teach you the lessons but from other professors. She does not grade anything besides the discussion in which is pointless because she doesn't point out your mistakes if you got it wrong. And she assigns a lot of work. Find another professor!!!!!!!!!!!!
8887,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"The class is going to require a lot of work, but that is the nature of the class. If you do all the assignments on MyMathLab and actually use the ""help me solve"" thing, you can easily solve all the questions using the steps they give you. Taking the class online was easy for me because the last half of the tests you take at home and you can cheat."
8888,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,5.0,"A lot of homework. I would recommend this class for a semester, not in summer. You would need to put a lot of effort and time into this course. Midterm and final are required in a test center. Her lectures are relevant to the assignments. tough subject, but great professor!"
8889,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,4.0,Very professional and easy to work with
8890,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,1.0,5.0,Very tough grader. Would not recommend
8891,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,4.0,4.0,She is a caring and great professor. She gives you a lot of opportunities for extra credit and she gives group quizzes. Her test arent too bad if you study and do your mymathlab homework. She will help you if you don't understand. She's kinda funny and really nice. PAY ATTENTION. If math isn't your strongest subject she will help you.
8892,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"Wilson is indeed the worst teacher you could have ever chosen. She is very disrespectful, and will encourage you to drop her class after first test fail. She is very quick and will not stop to help you if you dont understand the materials. Shed look at you as if you were dumb , if you have questions and your hands should not be raised. Very tough"
8893,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1033,2.0,5.0,She really strict.. the way I passed was from doing mymathlab they way she teaches is pretty fast it would be better if she broke down the work more.. you can have or use your phone out in class cause she gets mad and DO NOT TAKE HER MORNING CLASS IF YOUR NOT A MORNING PERSON.... shes ok but she can be better with the teaching
8894,615111,Rose,Wilson,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1106,4.0,2.0,"I have taken her for every college math course up to Liberal Arts Math, the last math course required for Cyber Security BAS at PBSC. I have received an A in all 3 with her. She will help you office hours if you need help understanding the material, just make sure you don't go before lunch time go earlier to see her. Do your homework you will be ok"
8896,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,4.0,2.0,"Amazing teacher, the way she teaches her class is extremely easy to understand specially if you struggle with math, her class fill up really quick but i will definitely take her again"
8897,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,4.0,3.0,I love Prof. Sharp. Her class was a bit challenging at first but then you get the hang of it once you start studying and actually setting your mind on the subject. There is a lot of work involved so be prepared to spend some time studying. Prof. Sharp is great and actually tries her best to make you understand!! She doubles the highest grade!
8898,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,3.0,She's a VERY good teacher and she really does care about how everyone is doing in her class. She explains math very well and this is coming from someone that used to get Cs in math class. I got an A in her class but I did have to work for the grade. She is definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had and I would take any of her classes again.
8899,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,4.0,"She's really nit-picky about grading and only does it because it's wrong and she wants what is best for us. Doesn't let us use phones in class either. She is really nice and a wonderful teacher. If you're looking for a class you can just skip this isn't for you. You may be able to teach it to yourself, but you will get cut by her if you don't go."
8900,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,5.0,3.0,"Sharp gives clear instruction. In her combined Precalc/Trig class, material is taught at a FASTER pace, a lot more material in a shorter period of time. She's a math ""purist"" meaning she will take test points off for formatting details, but she will also give points if you do not end with correct answer but had the correct work. It works both ways."
8901,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,4.0,"I took her for pre-calculus, voluntarily , (My SAT score placed me in Cal-Analytic Geometry I) Very nice professor, but a harsh grader. no extra credit on the test, and the test is the only thing that matters. A lot homework but she never checks it, it for your own good."
8902,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,5.0,4.0,"Professor Sharp is one of the best math professor I've ever had. Her notes are thorough, and her lectures are always engaging. Homework isn't graded but practice enough and you WILL see a positive result. Lots of time and effort must be invested in this class, especially if you don't have a strong foundation in algebra. Overall, I highly recommend."
8903,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,4.0,5.0,"Barbara is an amazing person and professor. She is very passionate for what she does however, MAC1147 is a combined course with pre calc and trig. If you are going to take this class I recommend you take this class and maybe one other and THATS IT. She will test you almost every two weeks and you will have to memorize quizzes. A lot of homework!!!!"
8904,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,4.0,3.0,Barbra sharp is very nice and very honest if you work hard and study every day I would suggest you take her !
8905,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,4.0,"Awesome teacher! Shes a tough grader but that's because she wants you to really know the material. You definitely need to study daily especially if you take a 6 week summer class like I did. She makes sure to let her students know when shes available outside of class. I wish she thought calc, I would definitely take her! I like her teaching style."
8906,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,3.0,"I love Prof. Sharp. She graded pretty tough, but she did it to ensure you won't make the same mistakes on future tests or in the next math class. She is super caring and always makes sure to let her class know that she always available outside of class. She provides a lot of chances to get a good grade (EXTRA CREDIT)!!"
8907,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,5.0,4.0,"Very fun professor, but the Precalculus and Trigonometry course is a bit of a monster. Lots of work and a big time commitment. Homework isn't graded, but is pretty much required to pass. Do the homework she gives. You'll have a lot to remember on exams, and practicing really does drive it home. Ask her for help and form study groups with others."
8908,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,3.0,"The best math professor ever!! She made calculus so much easier for me, &amp; because of her strict grading rules it helped me in calc 1 as well. Everything was pretty straight forward and she is super good at explaining math. I wish she taught all math classes. I wouldnt have been able to get an A in calc 1 without her help from the previous semester"
8909,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,5.0,4.0,"Shes honestly a great professor. This class is not at all easy, but its very doable. You have to put in the work, she even gives study guides, but shes really fair and shes been teaching for so long that she knows the best way to explain something, she gives little tricks to help with hard trig stuff and everything, shes always willing to help"
8910,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,3.0,Professor Sharp was the best professor Ive had for math. Show up to class and she will explain every problem and tells you what to expect on her tests. She also gives you study guides for the tests. She is picky about what she wants but it is to help you in the future! Im taking her again for Trig next semester.
8911,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1045,5.0,2.0,She is the nicest lady ever and she explains things clearly for you to understand and she has such great sense of humor. I love when she gives little stories that relate to the lectures because that helps you remember certain things when taking the tests. One of the best professors in pbsc. She made me enjoy math and I didn't want the class to end.
8912,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,4.0,Best professor at Palm Beach State College! You definitely have to work for your grade but it's not too hard. She gives you the answer keys for the quizzes and helps you understand the lesson as much as possible. 1000000/10!!!! Definitely will make calculus easier for you!!
8913,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,5.0,4.0,Very easy professor and her teaching techniques are great too. She expects you to study and do all the homework. Homework is not graded but it is very helpful if you do it. Also go to all the SI sessions and you will pass the class with an A
8914,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,1.0,4.0,A lot of homework that doesn't even count for your grade but bit of extra credit for the tests. She doubles the highest test score but doesn't double any extra credit you got in it.  Makes you memorize everything and expects us to do imposible tests in very short time as if we were programmed for that. Show your work as hers or you still get a 0.
8915,1284681,Barbara,Sharp,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1147,5.0,3.0,She is a great math professor. Her grading is a little bit tough but she gives you exactly what she wants to see on the test. She gives you extra points on the test if you do the homework and she doubles your highest grade. I would definitely take her class again. She really did teach me a lot. I definitely recommend her!!
8916,216756,Costantino,Colombo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Biology,BSC2085,1.5,5.0,"Worst online course EVER! 10-22 hours per week of lectures recorded from a class 4 years ago. Fully 1/3 of it was like being subjected to sexual harassment. He's constantly talking about wishing he was ""hard"". He would specifically say ""This next bit of information is not important)  and then 20% of the exam was what he'd said to disregard. AWFUL!"

His lectures were normally very off topic and didn't help at all in preparing for his ridiculous tests. Even with studying 2+ hours a day, I was baffled on most of the questions we were tested on. I learned more about his wife than anything. He should teach at a doctorate level, not basic."

8938,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,3.0,"Professor P was a delight. I took a really fast course with her for speech, all online, and she made it very easy and enjoyable! She is so funny too &amp; gives great feedback. The course work isnt much at all &amp; only 2 speeches. She also gives a lot of extra credit opportunities! So take advantage. She knows what shes talking about."
8939,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,"Shes so funny and makes the lectures fun and engaging. Definitely learned so much taking her class, would definitely recommend!"
8940,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Like most people, I am scared of public speaking. However, professor Pachter really made the class as comfortable as it could be for us to give our speeches. As we were forced to switch to online only, she took it in stride and continued to teach at a high level through the tough conditions."
8941,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,3.0,"This class was an easy A! She offeres lots of extra credit opportunities. You do work in groups throughout the semester but they are educational and fun activities! She prepares you correctly for speech days. Only two speeches for the whole semester which is awesome! If you need any help, just ask and she will! Take her... you will not regret it!"
8942,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Professor Pachter is the best teacher you could have for Speech class. I took her in the summer class and I love it. She makes the class fun, and you learn a lot from her. The first day of class she puts you in a group and you get to know new people that can end up being your best friend haha."
8943,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,4.0,2.0,"Great teacher, Easy A"
8944,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPEEC1016,1.0,1.0,Her lectures lacked substance and were often unimportant to what we were being graded on. I didnt like how she would yell at students and put them down in front of their fellow classmates. If a professor has an issue with a student the professional thing to do is speak with them privately after class. Not a fan.
8945,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,"Very thorough, punctual and organized."
8946,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,4.0,2.0,"I dreaded taking speech class, but Prof P made it really fun. She encouraged the whole class to support one another throughout speeches. There's only 3 speeches and the groups we form are not made with the purpose of coming together for a grade but feedback and collaboration, which was really nice. Prof P is funny and I definitely recommend her!"
8947,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,"First day of class your put in to a group who you interact with A LOT, theres a lot of socialization that she makes us have with our classmates &amp; in class. 3 speeches overall &amp; the homework is easy stuff, she lets you get a better grade on stuff if you want. I took her for the summer course shes a nice/helpful teacher, totally recommend!"
8948,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,3.0,"Very active and personable teacher. Most people try to complain about her work, but I took her for an express 6 week course with no change in the work load and, unless you're extremely lazy, it is 100% do-able. I passed with a 99% and ended up making a great professional connection with her out of the course."
8949,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,3.0,4.0,She ok but she make you work
8950,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,4.0,"Professor Pachter knows what she teaches like the back of her hand. You can tell by how she presents her lectures that shes experienced and truly cares about the topic. Her class is very dynamic and fun. Be prepared to do group work and some really easy homework. Hardest part of the class is the research speech, but with her help it was easy."
8951,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1101,4.0,1.0,"if you do not have a fear in public speaking, you will ace this class. If you do have fear, she makes it very comfortable for you to break out of your shell. DO YOUR SKETCHBOOK CONSISTENTLY! She gives really helpful feedback that can be a huge jump in improving your next speeches in the class. SO kind but can also be passive. Stay on her good side."
8952,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"I call her ""The best"" for a reason. She really teaches you how to delivery an excellent speech. If the class is available take it!!!"
8953,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,4.0,1.0,"She is very nice and helpful, be mindful she greats the outline very closely she looks for all the little mistakes on your outline."
8954,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,She is very caring and her class is super easy if you just listen to her. I took another speech teacher who made everything hard and confusing but she tells you everything and gives easy due dates
8955,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,3.0,"She was amazing very helpful.. she helped you, step by step how to write an essay.. take her you will not regret it"
8956,222453,Marcie,Pachter,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1017,5.0,1.0,Best professor on campus!
8958,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,4.0,"Do not take this class!! Probably the worst professor I have ever had. He takes points off for ""not showing enough work"" even if the answer is correct. He is a VERY inconsistent grader and couldn't care less if his students learn or do well in the class. He requires you to keep a binder and grades it often. Also a RIDICULOUS amount of homework."
8959,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,I took professor Talebi both for MAT 1033 and MAC 1105 and I aced both! He is a very detail oriented prof and expects your work to be neat and show all the steps. This has helped me a lot to troubleshoot my errors easier. I am planning to take him for MAC 2233 as well and strongly recommend him to others. He is very knowledgeable.
8960,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,4.0,"His way or the highway. Lecture heavy. Starts from when the class starts to five minutes after. Doesn't like to answer questions, will tell you to look back at previous notes. GOOD LUCK..."
8961,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,1.0,5.0,"I do not recommend you take this class if you are trying to pass. He made me hate math even more. His lectures are very heavy he'll literally use every minute he has. He a very tough grader, gives endless homework, just when you think you're done, yeah right, there's more. ""I do not accept late work"", so don't even think about asking."
8962,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,Textbook is needed for the homework. Graphing Calculator required. Im generally good at math so this class was pretty easy for me. He covers all notes and everything for the test. The homework is usually slightly harder than the tests so I felt more than prepared for the exams. The final is cumulative though so be prepared for that.
8963,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,He explained everything in detail so that everyone would understand. No question was too dumb. He give lots of time to do the homework and grades for tests will be shown to us like two classes after the test. Really cares about what he is teaching. Would take again 100%
8964,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,4.0,"This dude single handedly made me change major. THE WORST. I was a business major until he ruined math for me. I had never struggled with math before him. ""i give partial credit on test questions"" correct answer but work is a little off. no credit. correct work wrong answer. no credit. He curved the whole class grade when everyone was failing :)"
8965,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"I took professor Talebi this past Fall 2018 Semester and ended up getting an ""A"" for the course. He is very knowledgeable, gives great lectures, wants students to succeed, gives partial credit on Tests, collects/grades homework, answers questions in every class from previously assigned homework, and is very organized. I strongly recommend him!"
8966,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,4.0,Professor Talebi is well organized and seems passionate about what he teaches. He explains difficult concepts well and gives you credit for work shown on tests. His lectures are clear and he provides good examples for the material covered. He is a great and respectable professor and I would definitely recommend taking him.
8967,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,COLLEGEALGEBRA1,1.0,3.0,"Over complicated every topic, will get off track easily and is extremely rude with responding to students. Will speak down to you any chance he gets. Be ready to teach yourself the entire class because his lectures will simply confuse you with him going off topic, over complicating, and teaching things from high level courses that arent relevant"
8968,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,1.0,"Doesnt post grades on blackboard. Teaches like high school class. Will not hesitate to call you out for anything.... missed class due to a work incident and was called out Infront of the entire class and forced to give a reason. Also had to visit family for medical reasons and he required flight and hotel information, total privacy violation."
8969,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1033,1.0,3.0,"Gives LARGE amounts of homework without consideration of other class or work outside of his own. Attendance to every class is mandatory even if he says its not, will call you out on not being in class. Would not take ever again."
8970,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,His reviews before tests are very useful. He also gives a lot of partial credit for our work on the tests. I found it a life saver that he bases 12% of our grade on our notebook checks for the homework he regularly assignes. It matters to this professor that your written work be very organized and in detail. I certainly recommend this professor.
8971,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,"I failed Statistics last semester &amp; I was terrified of taking it again. This professor really helped me. He writes all his notes on the board with clear examples, unlike other professors who use power point slides &amp; go too fast. He only assigns a few problems each night so its not overwhelming &amp; checks all of them on test day.  Highly recommended."
8972,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Talebi for 3 classes: Intermediate Algebra, College Algebra and Statistics. He is awesome! If he teaches the Calculus series, I will take him too! He is very fair, organized, knowledgeable, and accessible. I liked his step-by-step teaching style and have recommended him to quite a few of my friends at PBSC."
8973,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,He explains everything in detail and encourages questions in class. Very organized and expects the same from you on the homework and on Tests. Gives a lot of chances for extra credit and improving your grade. Finally he is very approachable and personable. I recommend him to any student that is honestly will to do the required work.
8974,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever. Would not recommend him to anyone.
8975,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,"Honestly worst teacher I've had so far, especially for math. Made me kinda hate math and slowly give up on my grade. I honestly do not recommend him unless you are willing to spend time and energy learning things from others or yourself. You either like him or hate him, passing or failing."
8976,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,5.0,If you're not proficient in math DONT TAKE HIS CLASS. His lectures are hard to understand as he over complicates the lessons and doesn't take into consideration students that are struggling. Talebi has high expectations that can be hard to reach and is an extremely tough grader when it comes to tests. Save yourself the stress and take someone else.
8977,485772,Massoud,Talebi,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,2.0,2.0,"He's a nice guy, but I wouldn't recommend. He wastes lots of time while teaching due to him going off topic. He also tends to confuse his students by randomly teaching us stuff we don't need to know  or ""from higher level courses."" Every time I've asked him for help, he's said the same thing: ""it's in your notes."" as if i hadn't checked already."
8979,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,1.0,Professor jones was the best professor Ive ever taken !! Took him over summer B wish the class was longer. Gives real life examples and situations to get you to dive deep into your thoughts based on each topic he teaches. I HIGHLY and I mean HIGHLY recommend to take him !!! Definitely taking him again my last semester !
8980,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,3.0,Definitely not your typical professor. He has interesting lectures but he does use the text book. When he makes his own power point slides he shares with the class to view anytime which is nice. Def passionate about criminal law and gives good insight. Not a hard class but I 100% learned something from him! You'd be lucky to be taught by him!!
8981,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJ2100,5.0,2.0,He went really into depth with his lectures and always provided other links and sources in case we wanted to do further research. He has a nice sense of humor and does his best to keep the content interesting.
8982,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2130,4.0,3.0,He is a nice professor. It is a lecture heavy class. Great teacher!
8983,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,1.0,Professor Jones was by far the best professor I had in my college experience. He has amazing lectures that helps you on your exam. Going to class isnt mandatory but if you miss class you will miss a lot important information on the exam and a interesting lecture. His study guide is what is exactly on the exam so just study. Good class to take !
8984,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,3.0,Prof. Jones is one of the best professors I have ever had! He's super funny and inspirational! His classes consist mostly of debates and really funny conversations. I would 100 percent take him again. The class was only 2 exams and if you pay attention and participate in class you will pass with an A!
8985,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,2.0,"He really cares about his students and he is one of the most inspirational professors I've ever had. He is super funny and keeps things interesting, and at the same time he gives really unique perspectives and opens your eyes to things you would've never thought of."
8986,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,1.0,Prof Jones is the best and really cares about his students actually knowing and understanding the concepts behind the materials that he would lecture. I had him for two of my courses and I have learned so much from him. Very understanding if you need help he always offers extra content on the blackboard or schedule a phone call to explain more.
8987,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CCJ2002,5.0,1.0,Amazing Professor Brought Great source of enlightenment.
8988,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2403,5.0,2.0,Really great teacher and person. Lectures are long but he trys to find a way to keep your attention even if it means saying something ridiculous. Fantastic class overall and I would recommend his classes to anyone interested in becoming a LEO
8989,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,3.0,Good sense of humor. Great professor. Mainly lectures &amp; engagement from the class the entire semester. (2) Tests which consists of the Midterm and Final. No papers! Take him!
8990,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,1.0,Professor Jones is extremely passionate about what he teaches. If you show up to his class and take some notes on the lectures you will be fine. The discussions are what the midterm and final reflect. Extremely easy course and you have fun by his jokes he constantly makes. If you need help in anything he is available to help.
8991,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJ2100,3.0,1.0,"His class was a breeze, aside from the fact that his lectures feel like they go on forever, he tries to make them as funny and interesting as possible. He gives a generous amount of extra credit questions on the tests. His class wasn't a requirement for me but I honestly learned a lot more in it and took much more from it than my required classes."
8992,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJ2100,5.0,2.0,"Professor Jones is the most understanding and genuine professors out there- easily one of my favorites. He was a defense attorney for 35 years so the man really knows his stuff. Only graded by the midterm and final so study accordingly, but his questions sometimes help answer one another and he's always an email away."
8993,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJE2130,5.0,1.0,Great professor! Really enjoyed his class and his lectures. Only 2 exams the whole semester which are based off his lectures &amp; textbook!
8994,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJ2100,5.0,1.0,"Human beings!! Great professors and energetic lectures, with a lot of discussion and engaging content. Would like to hear more stories from his law career, but given the time restraints, he did really well. Be prepared to read the textbook and watch videos and articles sent via email. Participation does matter and you will be called on."
8995,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJB2403,5.0,1.0,Professor Jones is passionate and knowledgeable about his job. You skim the book but his lectures and notes are mainly what's on his exams. You walk away from his class gaining knowledge that another professor would have made dreadful to learn. TAKE HIM!!
8996,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,2.0,"Professor Jones is a good Professor , a little wacky but cool. His final grade was based on the midterm, the final and attendance. He gives out all the materials needed to be successful and points out what you need to know for the exam. Study the material, show up for class and you will pass. I will be taking every class he teaches."
8997,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJL2100,5.0,2.0,The best professor Ive had. My major has nothing to do with criminal justice or law but I do not regret this class. I learned about things important in everyday life. Things any citizen should know. Funny guy makes the class fun. Take this class. Just pay attention
8998,1006062,Mark,Jones,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Criminal Justice,CJ2100,5.0,2.0,"Mark Jones is one of the best professors that I have come across in my entire academic career. Upon finishing my degree at PBSC, I attended Florida State, and now Cornell Law School. I have yet to come across a professor who can engage their class at the level that professor Jones does. It would be a shame for anyone to miss out on his class."
9000,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,3.0,Professor OBrien is amazing. He does two unexpected attendance checks for extra credit. He is extremely funny and makes the class really easy to understand. Every quiz is easy because he tells you what questions are going to be on there. Midterm and final were easy. His lectures are amazing and he goes off topic often and tells us about his life.
9001,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,2.0,"O'Brien is a great guy, take him! He makes learning about Earth science exciting. I took him spring 2019, and I still remember the material."
9002,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,1.0,"HE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EASILY!!!!! you have five quiz, the final and mid term exam. he basically gives you the answers for each quiz. something the book is useful . very funny"
9003,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,4.0,3.0,Make sure you talk notes on the lecture and study for the final exam you be fine
9004,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,1.0,5.0,He's sarcastic and doesn't gives enough points. You could be in the middle of surgery and he wouldn't take your excuse.
9005,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,2.0,"No hw, only short 15 question quizzes. There is a midterm and a final. He does 2 special attendance checks in the semester that count towards grade. Really passionate about science and teaching. He drops the lowest quiz grade. Don't have to bring textbook to class. He tells you what's on the quiz in his lectures."
9006,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,4.0,1.0,Very simple but boring class. There is three quizzes and the midterm and final. He does not believe in extra credit but as long as you listen to the lectures and take notes you should be fine .
9007,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,3.0,1.0,"I wouldnt say OBrien is my favorite but hes tolerable in terms of the curriculum. There is no homework or group assignments which is a plus! Theres only quizzes, midterm and final. Heavy on notes and be sure to study them all for each quiz. He also does surprise attendance checks (only twice) which are worth 15 points! DO NOT TALK OR USE PHONE."
9008,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1001,5.0,2.0,The best of the best of Palm Beach State College.
9009,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,1.0,3.0,"Professor O'Brien is extremely knowledgeable. However, will make students feel stupid and dumb when answering a question. The quizzes and exams were fair. A few times he made fun of cultures and languages. He will also criticize religion a lot! Don't buy the book, you will not use it. The professor was smart, cocky and rude! Overall ""okay"" class."
9010,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,2.0,"This professor was the best professor Ive taken at palm beach state! He never gave homework, quizzes were 10-15 questions, 2 big test( mid term &amp; final). He made this subject interesting &amp; exciting. I wish he tought more classes at PBSC. Hes the best!! I would take him over anyone! Ps dont go on your phone or he will call you out :)"
9011,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,2.0,O'Brien is awesome really good at explaining things and is really a nice and funny guy. class is oretty easy as long as you show up and take notes on the simple powerpoints
9012,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ENC1000,4.0,4.0,"Really enjoyed Earth Science thanks to O'Brien. Take this class if you aren't a Science or Math Major, he makes the class very easy to follow with a powerpoint (book optional) so take good notes, pass the two exams, and you'll definitely pass. He's a great science teacher and is very straight up about his grading, would definitely reccomend."
9013,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,EARTHSCIENCE,5.0,3.0,"The lectures are interesting, hes a funny guy. You dont really need the book because everything on the quizzes and exams are on the PowerPoint, so as long as you take notes you should be good. Quizzes are easy and so are the exams, as long as you look over your notes before taking them. No homework at all."
9014,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,3.0,3.0,"I have very mixed feelings about him. While I feel like he was good at explaining the fairly simple material, he was not the nicest dude out there. Definitely one of those professors that makes you feel dumb for answering a question incorrectly. Do well on quizzes, and don't sleep on the midterm/final. Both tests account for over 70% of final grade"
9015,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,4.0,3.0,"Prof. O'Brien is great. His class was interesting, and you learn a lot of things you should know about how the world works. It isn't a lot of commitment and you only have to read the chapters if you want 100% on each quiz. He is passionate about science, and his lectures can be really entertaining. He also encourages you to rent the textbook."
9016,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,4.0,Love his teaching style!!
9017,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,3.0,"Obrien was a cool teacher, knew about his stuuf and was passionate for it. If you study notes and pay attention and study some chapter outlines you will be ok. The test are the midterms. You will learn and it will be a good class to keep you awake!"
9018,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,3.0,Excellent professor. Grabs your attention in his lectures. Make sure you take notes you will need them for the midterm and final and definitely study for those test if you bomb one you will fail the class. Makes the grading criteria clear on the first day of class. I would recommend him to anyone.
9019,1014325,Gerald,O'Brien,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Earth Science,ESC1000,5.0,2.0,He is an amazing teacher and one of the best I've ever meet! I learned so much in this class. He is a no crap prof. but if you participate he will help you a lot.
9021,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,5.0,3.0,Ive taken him for all my sciences so far and do not plann on switching teachers anytime soon. Gives you the grade you deserve. You earn your A
9022,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,5.0,1.0,Great professor. All you have to do is show up to class. The information for the tests are all on the powerpoints. You will not regret taking this class.
9023,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,5.0,2.0,Simple class. Powerpoints are very detailed. Great for people that want to go into the medical field. Exams are based on info from the powerpoints. He doesnt care that much about the discussion and assignments. Pretty much will give you 100 for them if you try.
9024,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2010,5.0,3.0,This is a easy class but you do have to work at it. I took the online class and I got a A in the class. You must not FORGET the deadlines. Make sure you complete all research assignments and discussion boards. As for the exams! It's all about how you prepare for them. Look at the key things he gives you and find it in the powerpoints. Easy A
9025,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,5.0,1.0,"Such an easy class, all the information needed for the assignments are on the powerpoints, and if you use the study guide it's literally the exact same thing of whats on the exams. No final, I guarantee you will not regret taking him!"
9026,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,5.0,2.0,Awesome anyone to take this class please choose him! Literally everything is there for you to pass. Just be consciou of the deadline. NO MAKE UP! super easy A. 15 chapters . each one had one discussi and one super easy reseach assignments. 6 exams and he gives you the study guide which is exact the exam (20 questions each) use the voice over powerp
9027,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,5.0,3.0,What a great class!
9028,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,5.0,2.0,Class was very easy! He tells you everything that is going to be on the test! Only 6 test!
9029,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,5.0,1.0,"Very easy class! It's hard NOT to get an ""A."" He tells you exactly what will be on the tests. I have to admit, lectures were sometimes boring, as there is a lot of information thrown at you at once. But he did a great job of teaching, and I learned a lot from taking his class."
9030,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,2.0,"Amazing! Easy A if you read the pwrpnts and answer the study guide Q.'s before the exams. I took it online in 6 weeks. Tests every week. No mid-term or final! Easy discussions and research assignments weekly (sometimes you, literally, just had to cut and paste a paragraph from another website). TAKE THIS CLASS &amp; PROFESSOR ONLINE! You will thank me!"
9031,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,2.0,1.0,"Although this was an easy class, it won't benefit you if you plan on working in the medical field. Answers to the test are in the PowerPoint. Sadly that means majority of the people don't even bother to read the slides they just look for the answers."
9032,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,5.0,1.0,"He is one of the easiest professor I have ever had. Do the work and it's an easy A. He responds quickly to your emails. Overall, extremely easy if you do the work."
9033,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,5.0,2.0,"Take and you won't regret! Easy A. Weekly research paper and discussion, but they aren't hard. 200 words max. Gives clear study guides that if you do you will get an A on the test. I'll only take him for any class he teaches. You won't regret it! Promise! Oh, don't buy the book! He doesn't use it, all PowerPoint. Saves you $$$."
9034,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,4.0,4.0,Understandable
9035,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,5.0,1.0,"Easiest online class. Take his class, easy ""A"" guaranteed! The study guides are extremely helpful and pretty much tell you what will be on the tests. 1 Discussion &amp; 1 assignment every week, no more than 200 words each and 1 response of no more than 100 words, very easy."
9036,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,5.0,1.0,"I am beyond glad that I chose this professor. Took him online, best decision ever! Class simply consists of weekly discussions, reply to 2 classmates and assignments that are 200 words only (which are super easy) and 6 Exams 20 questions each, 30 minutes on the clock (he gives you answers to them on the power-points anyways). EASIEST A!"
9037,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2086,5.0,1.0,There is a research assignment and discussion for every chapter with one exam for every two chapters! The study guides for the tests are spot on! There is no way you could do poorly in this class if you stay on top of the deadlines and get the work done! Very easy A!
9038,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,MCB2010,5.0,2.0,"90% of grade is only 6 test, 20 questions, all online, open book, open powerpoint, open notes. no assignments or final. 10% is attendance. Show up to class and listen to his lectures he stops and tells you which slide is a question on the test. very easy to get an A. Took him 3 times, a/p2, biology online, and microbio."
9039,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC1010,5.0,1.0,"Great teacher. Took this class online, there are a lot of discussions and assignments but they are super easy and mandates LESS than 200 words! If you write something he will most likely give 100 on that assignment. you have to respond to one person because he will take 20 points off. Taken him 3 times already. He has great power points."
9040,424010,Silvio,Arango-Jaramillo,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Science,BSC2085,5.0,1.0,I took this class online and it was an easy A. Just do the assignments before the due date and study the study guides he emails before the test and it will be your easiest A.
9041,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,"This class is a hard class, however Prof. Manley makes it very manageable. The tests are very direct, so study and you will pass. The final exam is a group presentation. I am absolutely terrible at math and I passed with a ""B"". I would definitely recommend Prof. Manley!"
9042,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,Amazing! She really breaks it down for you. If you want to actually like learning statistics take her you will be happy you did!
9043,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MGF1107,5.0,1.0,Best math teach ever.  very easy course.  she simplifies the instructions so that anyone can get it.  her powerpoint presentations she is very tough on though. you will not regret taking her if you struggle in math.
9044,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,"Honestly, math is one subject that my brain can never function. Yet, when I took Professor Manley for summer Statistics I would do it again. Her class is straight forward, she cares about her students and want to see them do great!! Palm Beach State should be happy to have an teacher like her and not take advantage of her!!! BEST TEACHER EVER!!"
9045,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,LIBERALARTS,3.5,2.0,Great class !  if your bad with math take her ! many extra credit chances. teaches what you need to know does not waste your time gives reviews that are like the test with different numbers.  class is easy but like any class some work is required I'm an average student so that should tell you a lot about how easy the class was
9046,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,Professor Manley's class was about as easy as any statistics class. We had an SI class as well as an online application we used in class. Overall we didn't use the book that much. But for someone like me who has trouble with math - I got a 87% its worth taking her. she makes math fun and easy! :)
9047,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Professor Manley is the best!! I was apprehensive going into Stats, but she explained every single step of the way. I definitely recommend taking her. There are 6 test and homework is not required but necessary to help you study for tests, plus she gives you extra credit for the homework. YOU MUST HAVE A LAPTOP"
9048,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,"I heard so many horror stories about statistics, she made it so understandable. Love her, I hope I can take her again for another class."
9049,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA,5.0,2.0,"she best PBSC can offer for a math class. she's willing to help you if you ask. remember stat is not an easy subject, but if you followed her and do you work you will get an A."
9050,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT,1.5,4.0,"She has changed her method of teaching, because of the school.She does not know what she is doing. She is very hard to follow on the board, and taking note is even harder as she does not organized her writing..."
9051,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT,1.5,3.0,"I am so disappointed of her! She has no interest in having her students to succeed. She does not answer your questions,she is difficult to understand,her tests are tricky...Take Prof.Bush in Garden, SHE wants you to succeed, and you will learn a greater deal..."
9052,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,1.0,BEST PROFESSOR AT PBSC! Hands down no question about it just take her ! Unless you slack and dont do your homework or dont ask for help then you will fail. But keep up with your work study and you should be fine. She does not trick you at all everything  on hw is on the test. Makes everything easy =)
9053,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1106,5.0,3.0,"I adored her, and the way she taught the class.  She has a great way of getting you to understand the material.  Don't get me wrong she doesn't put up with BS, but she is awesome!!!!"
9054,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MFG,5.0,1.0,took her for liberal arts math. introduced me to things i had never seen before but made it so simple that i grasped with ease.   homework not require but is recommended to complete.  give practice test and multiple choice but they handicap you when you need real answer.  take her.  she is the best math teacher at pbsc.
9055,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,3.0,"my WEAKEST subject is math. I'm more of a right brained person hence I'm very weak when it comes to Mathematics but excel in Arts. THIS TEACHER however, made it easy for me to understand everything. I got A's in most of my tests. I had 2 low ones, one was dropped but one didn't, I got a high B instead. But hands down. She's the best in the field."
9056,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"The best the college has to offer for a math professor - if you take her you will not be sorry. I got my money's worth and really walked away with some great knowledge. You do not need a book just a laptop. You can get a A or B but will need to study, do all the handouts and don't miss class or you will fall behind."
9057,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"She is a great professor :) honestly practice the homework, pay attention, ask questions and you will be fine. Practice test is same as test with different numbers! Highly recommend her"
9058,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"I am TERRIBLE at math.  She is absolutely the most amazing teacher! Just pay attention, do the work, and you will pass.  She really makes things clear and easy to understand."
9059,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,"GReat professor, The class was very easy , pay attention to all the things she has to teach, you will pass this class no doubt. You are required to bring a computer, don't buy the text book, she doesn't use it. on the other hand Im upset that people were trying to CHEAT, when she's telling you what u need to do, PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!"
9060,580975,Bonnie,Manley,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"This professor is the best math professor pbsc has. Her classes fill up pretty fast and this proves she's an amazing professor. you will not get lower than B mostly everyone gets an A!!! :) she teaches all types of math classes. I had her for intermediate algebra, College algebra and now statistics. take her class!!!!"
9062,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,1.0,"He was a very good professor and person, one of my favorite classes. He really knew how to break it down and explain things to everyone. He always keeps tracks of his students and you have plenty of time to complete all of your assignments. Tests are easy"
9063,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,1.0,"Mr. C is a very good teacher who explains, gives examples and puts into practice the subjects we must do, he is an exeptional teacher, very respectful and inspirational, he is willing to work overtime outside of class and is very fair to everyone. That's why it deserves a really good average in the rate."
9064,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,4.0,2.0,"I enjoyed the classes with MR. Carhuamaca. His explanation are specific, and I feel confident asking questions."
9065,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,2.0,"The best! I was concerned about starting a math class for the first time in years, but Mr. C can make confusing subjects accessible and simple to understand. No one left behind... a great experience!"
9066,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,4.0,"The teacher was very knowledgeable, helpful, and patient."
9067,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,3.0,he's a pretty chill professor and that's great for me. He made math not boring to me.
9068,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,2.0,"He is one of the best professor I meet in this country, he always willing to help and listen."
9069,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,3.0,Professor C is the coolest professor Ive ever had at Palm Beach State. He has a good sense of humor and Id recommend you take his class if you havent already.
9070,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,4.0,3.0,Tests are hard but if study you can pass them
9071,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,2.0,"Mr.C is a great math teacher, very helpful, nice and funny sometimes would consider taking this class if I was you."
9072,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,3.0,Best Professor you will get hands down! Will break down every problem if you have any questions. Easy to talk too. Would take his class again if he taught a higher level course of Math
9073,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,2.0,"Professor Carhuamaca, is one of the best professors in math. He is well organized have amazing content lectures ,explains and help's you if you dont understand, I would recommend Mrs C, to anyone that wants to learn math he is the best ."
9074,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,2.0,"Mrs: C , Is one of the best professors, he gives the best lectures and help you out with his videos. He always clarify over if you need more help, he actually care about his students learning success , he is awesome I would recommend him to anyone that actually want to learn math because he is patient and love s his student's."
9075,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,1.0,Mr. Carhuamaca is a good teacher. He really know what he is teaching.
9076,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,1.0,I didnt like math at all until I took this professor. He had an amazing way of teaching. All you need to do is pay attention. I definitely recommend you to take him especially if you arent strong in math.
9077,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,3.0,"Great teacher, breaks down the information well and is willing to cater to your questions to make sure there aren't any grey areas."
9078,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,1.0,Hes great I would definitely take him again. I loved this math class!!!
9079,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0022,5.0,3.0,I was intially very worried about starting Math after having been out of school for years! I have to say this class really helped me build confidence and skills to move on confidently to my next math. This is a teacher who loves what they do and it shows in a big way. Anyone who had the opportunity should take Mr C.
9080,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,4.0,2.0,Really breaks down the content and makes it look easy to do also practice test is similar to the test which arent tough
9081,1360688,Yoshua,Carhuamaca,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT0056,5.0,5.0,I have already taken this course and PROF C was by far more attentive towards the students than last time. Prof C is a rare one to find he makes class worthwhile and genuinely connects with students and know how to make the most complicated problems manageable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
9082,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"Terrible teacher, doesnt know how to explain, and would tell students to visit the math lab. Starts a problem and wouldnt finish it, will take points off for everything. Couldnt adapt correctly to online instruction, and wouldnt answer via email. She uses a TEXTBOOK, but not the mymathlab for hw. DO NOT TAKE HER, unless u are good with math!!!!"
9083,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,5.0,"Please, if you have any other professor options for this class, take those instead! Not only does she not post grades until the last day of the semester, but she is also very picky about how she grades. She expects you to have full knowledge of this class on day one and will make fun of you if you ask any questions."
9084,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,5.0,I do not recommend this professor to anyone who would like to pass
9085,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,4.0,"She never finishes her problems and always tells you to either look over what you did, or ask the person next to you. Her explanations of problems are awful too (along with cursive everything) - expecting you to write down minute details on your own test without putting it in her own work half the time. I used the texted book instead in the end."
9086,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033C,3.0,3.0,She speaks very low almost quiet at times. She has an attitude.
9087,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,4.0,Horrible horrible horrible
9088,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,The worst professor of all time never been with such a worst one in my entire college life I would rather change my major from maths to something else than taking her class doesnt understand anything and when questions asked by us sutudents she doesnt know the answers for most of them and just drop the topic to a different problem
9089,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,2.0,4.0,"Statistics should not be this hard, the way she explains topics is so complicated and she ended up skipping a lot of material. Her tests are nothing like the homework or class lectures and she is no where near to being fair on grading tests. Her class is passable but I recommend to pay attention to how she wants her answers on tests and study"
9090,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,5.0,"If you take her class, be ready to spend a lot of time in the math lab. She does not finish problems on the board and when you have questions, she tells you to ask your neighbor. Her test are only a handful of problems all worth different amounts. She also does not collect homework."
9091,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,4.0,"I had to withdraw because I kept getting F's on her tests. I would do all the homework multiple times to study too. The second test I received from her, she told me I did better, but I got a 68%. If you can't teach yourself, do not take her!"
9092,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,Please do not take her. Statistics should NOT be this hard. I would study for only her class ONLY because her tests were so short. The longest test was 5 ?'s. You would have to teach yourself because she would just vaguely talk about the topic and in the same day she would be done with 6 sections &amp; the following day would be test. Horrible class.
9093,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,2.0,4.0,"Unless you know a thing or two about statistics before entering this class, be prepared to feel completely lost until the last 3 weeks of the course. She doesn't take attendance, but if you skip class you will 100% fail. Also, she gives hw, but doesn't grade it. If you don't do it though you probably won't pass any of her tests."
9094,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,4.0,"Biggest waste of my time. Her explanations are awful. So awful in fact, I was forced to learn everything out of the book. The book is very hard to understand. As someone who's taken the ""honors"" version in high school, it would take me 3 hrs  a ch, and an 1 hr 30 min for notes, and 3 hrs of problems. If you love your family, take anyone else."
9095,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"Worst teacher ever, not fair with grades, three question tests (get one question wrong and get a D) and not clear in instruction at all. I received an F in her class, took it next semester with someone else and passed with an A+"
9096,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,"Dont take her, save your time and your GPA"
9097,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,2.0,I love this teacher. If i could take her for every math class i needed i sure would!!!! she is always available to help you whenever. She will not move on to the next subject if you do not understand the previous one. Excellent Teacher. She does not collect HW so you have to know self discipline and study on your own for the tests.
9098,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,4.0,I heard stories about her teaching but they were clearly all wrong. She refuses to move onto another subject  if another student doesn't understand. She gives HW but doesn't collect it. That's the trick. People don't do the homework and don't realize that the tests are the Hallmar don't do the homework and don't realize that the tests are the HW
9099,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever. Don't take her. She doesn't teach. She believes that everyone already knows statistics. Tests have 12 questions. Don't take her.
9100,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,STA2023,1.5,5.0,"She gives homework but does not collect it. The homework will help with tests more than she ever will. She is not helpful, I would not take her again nor would I recommend her. If you can teach yourself then fine, but if not, do not take this class trust me. I taught myself anatomy and chemistry I am not dumb. This class is hard, she does't teach."
9101,347411,Marie,Langston,Palm Beach State College (all campuses),Mathematics,MAC1114,3.5,4.0,"Wasn't until after the semester that I found out I didn't need this class. But it definitely helps if you took pre-cal before going into this class, so you have better understanding of the material. Good teacher, pay attention, don't miss class."

She treats you with respect and talk to you as adults. The lectures are always interesting. You will never want to miss her class. Be prepared for 3 speeches the entire semester!

You WILL have to work; although it is not difficult. The lectures do not even feel like lectures. She will go through her Power Points and then as a class, we discuss the information as a group. I found it very easy to retain information that way. She is also funny and so sweet. Recommend 100%"

However, Mrs. Darling's Friday classes are something you would look forward to. Not only are her lectures hilarious, but she also has a clear grading criteria and cares for her students.

9132,1493387,John,Liss,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"Take him for any history he offers! I wish I'd taken him for 1301. He is approachable, funny, and really wants to make history interesting. Sometimes he goes ""off-topic"" but that makes him seem more like a person and less like a professor. Exams are *SHORT* answer, if you study for a few minutes, you will pass. No book, just some handouts. Loved it"

9142,1493387,John,Liss,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Liss is more of a buddy telling stories than a professor. He relates to students and gets straight to the point. Gives all the material you need in class and also makes notes available on BlackBoard.  You can tell he LOVES history and wants to get you involved in learning about it. Not ""easy"" per se, (you WILL have to study) but worthwhile."
9143,1493387,John,Liss,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIS1302,5.0,1.0,Mr. Liss is an AWESOME history teacher!!! I highly recommend his classes and you don't even need a textbook!
9145,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,1.0,4.0,"He likes to ridicule his students. He feel superior to them, and looks down on them. Hes not afraid to call out ppl. If you dont want to be constantly targeted and ridiculed and not treated with respect then dont take him. He was the worst, he basically drained me emotionally. and he makes assumptions of his students without even knowing them."
9146,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI1306,5.0,2.0,"The kindest professor I have ever taken! I took him for a minimester, and although it was fast paced, and we had to write a lot, I wouldn't mind taking a course with him again! The minimester course consisted of 4 stages. 9 discussions (3 during the first stage) and 2 for the rest of the 3 stages, along with 4 assignments per stage and 4 exams!"
9147,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"I loved Dr. Loresco but some of the topics made me slightly uncomfortable, such as discussions on trans and other sensitive topics."
9148,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"He really prepares you for tests as long as you show up to class and take good notes you should have no problem with passing, really makes sure you know the material before a test by going over the material thoroughly, cares about his students whether they are learning"
9149,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,MARR2340,5.0,1.0,"One of the easiest courses I have ever taken. He divides the class into ""stages"", with 2 discussions (300 words), 1 assignment (4 paragraphs) , and 1 test with four questions (each question requires a response of 4 paragraphs). You have about a month to do the work, and you can always turn in late work. TAKE HIM, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!"
9150,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,1.0,4.0,"I wish i could give him a 0/5 rating because frankly, he does not deserve a 1/5. Also, 350 characters are not enough for what i want to say."
9151,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI1301,1.0,3.0,"He made me cry. he ridiculed me when I asked for help on an assignment.

9152,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCIO2301,5.0,1.0,"The plus side of this online class is that your textbook is free!!! There are videos you need to watch for discussions (300 words each). Educational and not boring. The assignments are papers (4 paragraphs long) and the Tests are 4 questions and each ? is 4 paragraphs. You have 4 ""stages"" so there's 1 test, 1 assignment and 2 discussions per stage."
9153,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI1301,1.0,5.0,"Terrible professor that looks down his down on his students. He loves to hear himself talk so don't raise your hand. He's not interested in what you have to say. Here's something he said to one student ""You sound like a little prostitute."" His test are completely unreasonable, so you better be in class taking lots of notes."
9154,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,2.0,4.0,"I wish this website could let me write more than 350 characters, cause I have some words. But I guess all I can say is I wouldnt take this teacher if you like to participate in class because if you dont have the right answer, or better yet, his answer, he will call you out, make fun of you, and kill your urge to learn about the topic."
9155,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI1306,5.0,3.0,"Took Mr. Loresco in Spring 2018. Really enjoyed his class, really interesting lectures. Makes you really think and realize whats going on. 4 quizzes, 1 was take home. 2 Group projects, 2nd Project is the Final. Lectures are important to the quizzes . Book is needed, mostly for the chapter vocabulary words that will be on the quizzes"
9156,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCIO2301,5.0,3.0,"I took him for Marriage and the Family and he was awesome! You won't use the textbook, so you'll rely on your notes. The lectures were really interesting over the topics! He'll use us or himself as examples, but the class is a safe space to learn. I highly recommend him for this class."
9157,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCIO2301,4.0,2.0,"I highly recommend taking any socio class with Loresco. The marriage and family class was fun and at times it would get personal, however, he makes it a safe environment for everyone and people are comfortable in sharing their opinions and stories. He always makes sure his students have a clear understanding and gives great examples."
9158,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,4.0,1.0,"He isn't clear with want he wants from assignments and the test questions can be unclear and vague. This class is very lecture heavy and requires a lot of note taking to pass his test. He gives good feedback, but won't hesitate to call you out. He also isn't very accessible outside of class."

9163,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOCI2301,5.0,1.0,He is a great professor but his class overall is interesting to learn he could be moody at times but overall his class is fun and easy to learn
9164,405071,Royal,Loresco,South Texas College (all campuses),Sociology,SOC1301,3.0,4.0,"His lectures are great, if he catches you on your phone he will call you out. There are a few group activities, tests are all on the discussions from that week so take notes, oh and answers have to be a paragraph. My only complaint is If you ever email him you never get a response even, other than that great teacher."

More than a speech class, he teaches you life as it is, sometines harsh and rude, but hey, that's what life is about, and sometimes the truth hurts. Good class to take to improve your personal and professional lives."
9169,650132,Fernando Alberto,Rivera,South Texas College (all campuses),Communication,SPCH1311,4.5,1.0,"He's a good professor, but he is VERY outspoken so i suggest you not be. Try not to step on his toes and he probably won't step on yours. Do it for the sake of your GPA. You can definitly get an A in the course if you give that research paper your all. If you decide to do the research paper in a group, choose your partners wisely."
9170,650132,Fernando Alberto,Rivera,South Texas College (all campuses),Communication,SPC1311,5.0,4.0,I just have one word.....wow!!!

You will find him bouncing all over the class room as well as his topics. Racially sensitive Hispanics may not like his class(he will talk a lot of smack about Hispanics). You do 2 presentations from the chapters in the book, he also give you extra credit work, and you do a paper (3-20pg depends on how much you learned)."

9189,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,LIFESPAN2314,4.0,3.0,Great lecturer and does his best to give many examples and to include others in the discussion.

9195,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSHY2301,2.0,2.0,"I feel like time stands still in this class. He is very monotone. Class is not exciting at all, but is a nice guy. Expects you to follow powerpoints, read the book, and watch his own YouTube lecture videos which are 40+min long for a twelve question quiz. Not worth the effort."
9196,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,LIFESPAN2314,3.0,3.0,"Mr. Weber was one of the most considerate teachers. The work and exams were not difficult at all, you just need to read your book and follow along with the power points. Would definitely recommend him."
9197,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,GENPSYCH2301,2.0,3.0,Mr. Weber is a very monotone teacher that does not make lectures interesting whatsoever. Although we hardly use the book in class I find myself having to use it just to understand the information. The tests he assigns are a little different than the material he asks us to study. If you want a fun and motivating teacher to take then this is not it.
9198,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Super nice, his class was easy, would take him again"
9199,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH1301,5.0,2.0,"Let's just say, I am now changing  my major to psychology!"
9200,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,LIFESPAN2314,5.0,1.0,Great professor no text book need
9201,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,Mr. Weber was Awesome!  I took  it as an online minimester. His outline is straight to the point and literally tells you all test and quiz due dates.  He responded to every email within 24 hours.  You do need to read your book.  All quizzes/tests are open and available to take from day 1!  Highly recommend. I am taking him again for PSYC 2314.
9202,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,3.0,He's a good professor but his class is hard quizzes and exams are only taken once  and they're only hard if you don't study take him if you're a psychology major
9203,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,GENPSYCH2301,5.0,2.0,Took as a minimester. Class is easy just need to read the book and study for quizzes and exams. Final was simple he gave you a review sheet with key terms which if you do you will pass the Final.  Responds to email. Only chapter quizzes and exams and 1 discussion at the beginning of class. Recommend
9204,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,GENPSYCH2301,5.0,2.0,"Great Instructor!  He gives very clear instructions, pay attention in lectures and study power points and you will pass!  If you read or skim through chapters in book prior to lectures it really helps and increases your understanding of psychology tremendously!  "
9205,737808,Timothy,Weber,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,"Best professor ever! He is very clear on what he expects from you. He is very kind, and you can see he loves what he teaches. I am definitely taking him for LifeSpan. Easy A if you keep up with the assignments. "

He gives some many opportunities for extra credit! and the best part the extra credit it accounted for in your average. He gives amazing lectures and many resources to ace your exams. Over all great professor and a great guy!"
9209,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,I recommend everyone to take him in the summer! lectures are longer but very duable and I bought the book but you really don't need it and the tests are exactly what he goes over during class and many extra credit opportunities and he's very kind and makes the class fun.
9210,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,You don't HAVE to show up to class since he posts powerpoints and study guides online but he usually gives extra credit in class and his lectures are interesting. He even allows us a whole page worth of a cheat sheet. I would copy my study guide and paste it in case i forgot something. But everything is easy to understand so you won't need it much.
9211,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Very funny, knows what hes talking about, and a lot of extra credit! Tests are easy if you read and study the reviews! Overall, a great teacher."

9213,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY1301,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED his class. I took him in the summer and I learned SO much!

Gives you 15 possible extra credit points. Tells really cool/funny stories to remember the material."
9214,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC1301,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor.
9215,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC1301,5.0,5.0,"Honestly this teacher is such a sweetheart, but do not take him if you plan to get an A he is HARD"
9216,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,3.0,3.0,"Do what is expected and you should pass with an easy A.

Pay attention and don't show up late or you can't sign in, although attendance isn't mandatory."
9217,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"I really would love to take his class again, the tests were a bit challenging but I passed every one of them.

He does use personal anecdotes as examples. He gives reviews for the test so its easy to tell what he's going to test the class on.  Textbook is required to do well. He quickly responds to emails and is attentive to students needs."
9220,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYC1301,5.0,3.0,I loved this class! He is an amazing teacher for sure. You have to study though but he makes it really easy for everybody. His class is fun and animated. I really enjoyed it.
9221,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSY1301,4.5,2.0,"Gives alot of EXTRA CREDIT!!!  Test are tough but if you study , you should be fine. 5 online quizes worth 20 points each. 4 exams worth 100 points.  You do need the textbook for online quizes and to study."
9222,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,2301PO4,5.0,1.0,Took Mr. Reittinger during the summer and it was easy! 4 exams and 5 online quizzes to do before the semester ends. Lectures run for the entire  class time but it's very informative since it will be on the exams. He does lets you know what will be on the exam while you're taking notes. Would take again!
9223,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,1.0,"I really enjoyed this class. I tend to sleep during long lectures, but I actually would stay awake all 2 hrs. His lectures were funny &amp; kept me attentive. He's really funny I recommend this class.

9226,637835,Eric,Reittinger,South Texas College (all campuses),Psychology,2301,4.5,2.0,He is very funny and makes the lectures entertaining. there was one or two lectures that were kind of boring but that was because the info was boring. He provides answers for questions in his lectures and will be clear that it is from test. He gives a lot of extra credit.  four tests the whole semester. Study guide + lecture notes will get you an A
9228,1074865,Armando,Lopez,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0100,5.0,1.0,Makes you understand very well I totally recommend him if you do not understand math

9230,1074865,Armando,Lopez,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0100,5.0,3.0,"HE LAID OUT THE RULES ON THE FIRST DAY AND KEPT THEM. HE FIRM, FAIR, AND CONSISTENT. HE ALLOWED THE CLASS TO IMPROVE ON LOW QUIZ AND TEST RESULTS ON CERTAIN OCCASIONS. I LEARNED A LOT SINCE I HAD NOT TAKEN ANY COLLEGE CLASSES AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL 31 YEARS AGO.

9231,1074865,Armando,Lopez,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1301,5.0,2.0,One of the best classes I ever took is easy to get an A but you have to put the work in and I would take again. had a lot of fun and learning in his class is easy also he explains everything amazing and helps the students a lot.
9232,1074865,Armando,Lopez,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,2.0,"This is by far the best Math Teacher I have ever had. I've always been good at math, but there were many gaps. I failed my TSI 3 times, even after tutoring at the CLE. Three weeks before I finished his class, I passed my TSI. I attended class until the last day and got finished with an A! Thank you Mr. Lopez."
9233,1074865,Armando,Lopez,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH100MATH200,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Lopez was legitely one of my favorite professors I have ever had.

He tries to make class as fun as it can be, but it's Math, so we all know how that can go sometimes. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have passed my TSI exam, that's how much I finally understood. Take him, go to class if you are serious."

9250,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,5.0,4.0,Great professor. She is pretty stern and sarcastic but do not let that intimidate you. She does care about you succeeding. She made sure you understood the topic. You can easily stay after class and ask her for more assistance on a topic you did not understand and she will more than gladly help you. WORK FOR YOUR GRADE!
9251,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1406,1.0,5.0,"Dont ever take her worse teacher ever, she is the hardest"
9252,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1301,5.0,3.0,"If you are looking for an easy A don't take her, but if you put In time and actually want to learn definitely take her. Her exams are hard but doable. She will help you, but you have to ask questions either in class or office hours. She is very friendly and will help you anyway she can you just have to put in the work. Always do her HW."
9253,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,1.0,5.0,"I took my BIO 1 online, it was easy. But BIO 2, with this professor, was extremely difficult! The work is fairly easy, its just that the professor takes forever to grade assignments. So halfway of the semester, you're left wondering where you stand. Emailing her? Forget about it. She won't answer emails, she'll respond in two weeks. Don't take her!"
9254,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1406,4.0,3.0,"Shes an amazing person with a huge heart, will not make it super easy, but very doable. Study for her exams, do the learnsmarts, print out her lecture notes and PAY ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING SHE EMPHASIZES AND WRITES ON THE BOARD!! She will catch you off guard on her exams if you're not paying attention during lectures. Not too boring during lecture"
9255,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2302,1.0,5.0,She will use everything in her power to make this even more difficult than it is. Dont take her
9256,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,1.0,5.0,Overwhelming amount of work. Grades posted extremely late so you don't know what to work on. Tests on material not covered.
9257,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,"Don't take her unless you are ready to stress, she expects a lot of you and the homework is a lot. By the time you finish some modules she already uploads some others of chapters we are not there yet. Take her if its your last option.."
9258,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,Don't take her unless this is your last option. Homework is overwhelming and are her exams.
9259,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2301,1.0,5.0,"She has super high expectations you will take tests on things you have never seen before in the entire semester. She is the toughest, you will get a million modules on pearson for a certain date. Hardest class ever"
9260,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1409,3.0,4.0,"Something was due nearly every day of the week. In Blackboard, assignments were not organized well and were sometimes difficult to find. There were times when assignments were not made available at the time indicated. Office hours were not honored. I called and messaged during office hours with no answer. She did provide a lot of extra credit work."
9261,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,4.0,4.0,"I had read several great reviews about her and I enrolled in the summer class. I had three summer classes and a job and I was able to pass with a high B. At first, I wanted to drop because it was too much information but then everything became so simple after the first exam. You will have a project with a powerpoint presentation it's so simple."
9262,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1409,4.0,4.0,"Good online class, but be prepared to work. Something is due almost every day. It is a tough class, but I rather take it than spend 3 hours in a traditional class."
9263,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1406,1.0,5.0,"This professor will reply to your emails in one week.

9265,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1409,3.0,4.0,"Although she is very nice, takes forever to respond to emails. It was too much homework for it to be non bio major class, due dates several days of the week. The work was not hard but it was time consuming and I had other classes."
9266,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1301,5.0,3.0,I'm a senior at UTRGV &amp; no professor has met Cordoba's standard of teaching. I never wrote this cause I expected most professors to be great. spoiler alert: many don't care. Dr. Cordoba cares and will help you do well if you ask for her help. Study EVERYTHING she writes on the board. Best of luck fellow colleagues! btw took all bio courses w/her.
9267,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,3.0,"i have taken bio 1 and 2, A&amp;P 1 and 2 with her, and all science courses for a bio major, she was the best professor i took at stc bar none, if you listen to her lecture everything she emphasizes is important, anything she puts on board is important, and extra credit is available, put the time in and you will do well, she helps you if you need it."
9268,1311329,Joana,Cordoba,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1407,5.0,1.0,I enjoyed taking her online for Biology this semester she was very helpful and she was clear about what she expects everyday try not to fall behind otherwise it's your fault

9284,170277,Luis,Guerra,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,3.0,3.0,He is a funny teacher. You don’t need the book only sometimes the lab book. He gives you study guides for the exam so study them. I got a C in his class and I didn’t really study that much. And in some exams he lets you work in partners.
9285,170277,Luis,Guerra,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,1.0,I will miss going to his class! he made class interesting and he will make you laugh! He really is a super nice and understanding professor. I totally recommend him :)
9286,170277,Luis,Guerra,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1302,4.0,2.0,"Awesome/hilarious/knowledgeable/ professor!i Have no interest in biology,but i loved going to his class. Labs are easy, nothing but take home quizzes,tests are pretty easy for the most part, you need to spend some time to study for them. Take him! He's awesome!"
9287,170277,Luis,Guerra,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1408,3.5,1.0,"Great professor! He will go over all the chapters and will give you a study guide for the exams, which is EXTREMELY HELPFUL!! You will enjoy to be in class with this teacher, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)"
9288,170277,Luis,Guerra,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1408,4.0,1.0,"awesome proffesor! the nicest proffesor you can ever have,he will give you study guides study them! and your good! he also helps you out alot he makes class very interesting, listen to him take notes and you will learn!!"
9290,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1402,2.0,4.0,Mr. Galvan is the worst teacher I have had during my 2 years at STC. He expects you to learn a lot of things in no time.
9291,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,1.0,5.0,"Even though I passed his class, his tests are hard if you dont study. Good luck passing his class if you dont memorize a thousand things in two days. He gets mad very easily if you don't get the subject within thirty minutes. He makes you feel stupid and he thinks you are lazy and accuses you of not trying or studying if you dont pass the tests"
9292,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1402,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Galvan is one of the most caring professors I have yet to meet. He was always on top of his students because he wants everyone to succeed. He has a dark sense of humor that I loved! His exams are easy if you study, don't expect to get a good grade if you don't put in the work! As a DEMSA student he made my time at STC fun!"
9293,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,5.0,1.0,Favorite professor
9294,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,5.0,5.0,"Professor Galvan is one of the best professors I have ever taken and I am so grateful for his teaching style. He also has a great sense of (dark) humor. Be warned: Professor Galvan is not an easy A professor, and he does call people out, but it's only because he wants you to learn the material. Would I take him again? Absolutely!"
9295,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Galvan is one of the nicest and most caring professors. I took him for both BIO1406 ,1407 including the labs. He always tried hard to answer all of our questions and did everything for us to understand the content. Although his class was demanding everything he does is for the students to actually learn. Im so glad I took Bio with him"
9296,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1402,1.0,4.0,"Proffesor calls you out for any little thing, gets annoyed easily. Listen to lecture and proper notes and you can pass the tests but overall his class gives you stress."
9297,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1407,1.0,5.0,"Bad Professor, would never take him again"
9298,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1407,3.0,3.0,"I took this class online in the summer and it was a lot of work. About 2-3 chapters a week w/exams every week as well as hw and labs. This class is not hard, its just a lot of work and this was not my only summer class so it was overwhelming. professor has everything laid out on syllabus and provides a lot of extra credit. keep up and u'll b fine"
9299,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,1.0,3.0,This is probably the worst professor I've had. He barley updates you on your grade which makes things worse cause it worries you. There are tons of concept maps which are a bit difficult and there is no review for the final. He just said to go over all the powerpoints from the whole semester which is stressful
9300,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1409,1.0,5.0,"I had to take him in order to complete my basic classes, but he seriously is so behind in grading your assignments. He expects us to turn in our assignments on time, yet he doesn't even give us feedback so continuously. He gives so many labs and tests so be prepared. Also, the tests are recorded if you take it online."
9301,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1409,1.0,4.0,"Worst class Ive ever taken, changes his mind at the last minute, never gives an updated grade, does offer some extra credit, but other than that worst class Ive ever taken."
9302,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1402,3.0,4.0,"Lectures are really heavy, attendance is for a grade so dont be absent. He gives a lot of text and theyre not really related to the ppt, dont fall behind on labs."
9303,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1407,4.0,3.0,"The lectures are good, he uses real life examples which makes the lecture interesting. He doesn't bore, but everyone must participate. The only bad thing is he'll call you out if you don't know the answer. There's a bunch of tests"
9304,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1407,5.0,2.0,Very good professor you will learn from him! HE IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!
9305,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1402,2.0,5.0,"I am a biology major, and he is the hardest professor i have ever had to take, the tests are vaguely related to the power point, and he is seriously a sadist, he puts people on the spot in class it is very uncomfortable. I managed to get an A, not because he was a great professor, but because of i studied real hard. i would not take again"
9306,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1406,3.0,4.0,"Good teacher, but not clear with instructions. Pls pls do the labs and keep up with the lecture. PLEASE! Pay attention because he will call on you. Grading is a bit late, so it really does stress you out going towards. Overall, i recommend you really bring your A game."
9307,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1408,4.0,4.0,Mr. Galvan is a fair grader and tries to make sure that the class is following along. He gave us an option of either 4 long tests or 8 short tests (halves what you need to study). He also gives students 50 points just for attending class (out of a 1000 point scale). Do not expect to pass if you slack off or don't attend his class.
9308,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1402,3.0,4.0,"Mr. Galvan seems extremely harsh and difficult at first but once he warms up to the class he's very funny and thorough about explaining things. He doesn't get upset when you ask a question. He's very monotone. Tests and quizzes are frequent but not difficult at all. Show up, do your work and you'll do fine."
9309,617057,Raul,Galvan,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1407,1.0,5.0,Please do not take him! Take anyone else! Lazy on so many levels. Nothing he gives you will help for exams. Take another Biology professor!
9311,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"If I could give him a rating of 0, I would. He is extremely harsh and all you do throughout the semester is 10 paper page essays and quizzes where you have to constantly read the chapters he gives. THE FINAL WAS A JOKE, you have to do an 8-page essay on the final. If you want your GPA to survive I DONT RECOMMEND TAKING HIM"
9312,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"I took professor for both History 1301 and 1302. Both courses have the same amount of work, 10 quizzes, 2 essays and one final. He is really picky with the essays but he gives you a detailed outline to follow, so be sure to follow it!!"
9313,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,Professor Rice is a good professor. Don't take him if you're a procrastinator! He assigns two essays/reviews but they are pretty easy if you follow his guidelines.
9314,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,2.0,4.0,"I got an A in this class and on all the essays, it honestly was not that hard if you did everything EXACTLY the way he wanted it. However, two 8 page essays, based on nonsense topics, was dumb to me. The final was an absolute joke. A test AND an 8 page essay? In the 1 hour and 50 minute class??? I dont think anyone did 8 pages from what i saw."
9315,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,"He really enjoys history, but he talks a lot and goes on with stories that will not help you on the final or even throughout the class. 10 chapter quizzes that take hours to read. Two 8 page papers and an 8 page written final. I recommend not to take him unless you have no other choice..."
9316,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,I learned the most in this class all semester!! Just put in the work guys!! it is not difficult if you know how to manage your time. Don't let the work required scare you. I promise you will enjoy his class if you bring a good attitude.
9317,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST2,1.0,5.0,"DO not recommend taking his class. A lot of reading for quizzes. 1 book review, 1 film review, and 8 page final."
9318,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,Don't take his class!!!! he assigns too much homework and his Final is an 8 page essay. He does not accept late work and you can be late because he will count you absent. Mr. Rice terrible professor his lectures are completely boring he goes off topic and  talks a lot ! his PowerPoint's are not useful at all
9319,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,Requires you to read almost all of the book for the quizzes. Very strict on grading the book and film reviews. Does not accept late work at all. He is very rude when you ask him questions about lecture or ask for help. Knows a lot about history but does not know anything about teaching a class. I do not recommend this teacher at all.
9320,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"very knowledgeable professor, he really engages in hi lectures.  If your willing to put time and lots of effort you will pass his class."
9321,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. He really knows a lot about history. The whole semester consists of 10 online quizzes, a book review, a film review, and final. Online textbook  saves you money. The only problem was reading the online textbook before each quiz took hours. Write as he speaks!! You'll  need it  the finals"
9322,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"Enthusiastic; lectures are engaging.  Class is not for slackers. Serious students only.  Free online text saves you $. You read, you ace the quizzes. Extra credit: attend local museum.  Book &amp; film reviews a must but he guides you thru it daily.  If a full time working dad made As in both reviews and most quizzes, any serious full time student can."
9323,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,2.0,4.0,"He focuses on 2 projects during the semester which are a book review and an old film review (7-8 pages long) and because of that we don't have the time to review his lecture. 10 online quizzes that requires hours of reading before answering 20 questions in less than 30 min. Final exam, 8 pages long essay in class, plus amendments and presidents."
9324,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"Mr. Rice is a knowledgeable professor, he looks like he really cares for his students. The only reason you should fail this class is if you don't show up and do the work. His lectures are interesting and i gained a newfound interest in history because of that. You have to write a few papers for this class but he's with you every step of the way."
9325,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,2.0,5.0,Attendance is mandatory. He assigns 2 major review which one you have to read an entire book (no 50 pg book either) and the other is a film review. He is a tough grader and you take like 10 to 11 online quizzes. Reading is a Must to pass!!  I would NOT Recommend or take him. Especially if you want to have a life.
9326,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,Mr. Rice is a good professor and knows a lot about History but he likes to assign super long papers about nonsense things. Actually I was doing good in his class but the last project which was a 1800 words paper about the KKK made me get an F on his class. You actually have to work for your grade if you want to pass his class.
9327,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,One of the best professors i have ever taken. I enjoyed his lectures even though they were pretty long. 10 quizzes taken online. An essay based on a book you choose from a list to read(on history). And he reminds the class to get things done so there are no excuses why you forgot because he consistently reminds us. Also he is very helpful.
9328,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,1302,4.5,3.0,Mr. Rice is a great professor but isn't easy. I took him in  a summer so his lectures did seem very long. No textbook required because he gives you an online textbook to save you money. A lot of reading but if you read you'll ace the class. One paper due at the end of the semester.
9329,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,1302,2.5,5.0,Mr. Rice is a good professor but his assignments are tough. the quizzes are made out of 20 questions but he wants you to read long lectures in order to complete them. Also the main projects are nonsense... we had to read a book and write a 1800 words paper about it and the same for a movie based on the KKK. Did not learn much about history.
9330,979544,John,Rice,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST2,4.5,1.0,I don't agree on the comments I think its mostly for his online classes. his class was very easy no joke 3 major tests a final essay and just be sure too turn in your homework and all the terms for his tests are on his power points  and a day before the tests he goes over the review the last 10-15minutes I recommend him for anybody!! no textbook!!
9332,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,3.0,I thought this class was going to be harder but I honestly enjoyed taking this course have been the best class I have taken so far. Everything we needed was provided for us. Assignments were easy to complete if studied for and if instructions are followed. The professor gives us enough time to get work done.
9333,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,2.0,She is an amazing professor! She lets you know that she will not put up with childish behavior. She is a tough grade but nothing that you cannot handle. If you work hard you will earn your grade! Her test are online and open for at least a week! At the beginning of class she will remind you what if due for the week! Her lectures are amazing!
9334,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,5.0,2.0,"She is a great professor but she wont baby you. Were in college and going to become teachers so she doesnt put up with a lot of excuses. She doesnt take late work at all! You will learn a lot but will work hard. Notes are blackboard, tests are online, usually one week to complete. Show up to class and do your hours and youll pass."
9335,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,2.0,Print out the chapters instead of writing them. Shes very clear about what she wants. She can be a bit rude and serious at times but the class is easy. All tests are online except for the final. Class is mandatory. And do all your observation hours.
9336,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,3.0,3.0,Shes good at teaching but I recommend somebody else because she is VERY PICKY grading your assignments.
9337,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,5.0,3.0,An amazing teacher. Clearly very passionate about teaching. Instruction is done in an easy to understand manner. Take this professor if you have the chance.
9338,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,2.0,I took her twice and both times she helped me grow as a student as well as a person. She is very passionate about her job. Participate in her lectures as well as group work and you'll be fine! Do your observation hours ahead of time. No question is a dumb question with her. She gives more than enough time with due dates!
9339,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,3.0,"Her class made me feel more excited about education. She is constantly engaging the class and teaching new material in interactive ways and different points of view. If my schedule would have allowed me, I would have taken the second part with her too. Tests were all online and all very easy. Final was in class super simple too. Learned a lot."
9340,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,5.0,2.0,"She really knows her material well, she gives awesome lectures. There is a lot of group work in this class. Tough grader on certain things. You will enjoy her class."
9341,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Riojas always informed us about upcoming assignments and projects with an appropriate amount of time to complete them. We had everything we needed to pass this class. Notes, the book, we were able to work in groups. If students didnt pass the class, it was because they didnt put the work and effort in."
9342,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,4.0,"She is an amazing teacher! Her class has me looking forward on being a future teacher. She does make you work for your grade, but nothing hard. She will help you come out of your shell when doing projects."
9343,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,2.0,Ms. Riojas is an amazing instructor. You will actually learn; she keeps the students engaged on the lesson... do all her assignments and turn them in on time and youll pass. She does not accept LATE work so be aware of that if you want to pass her class. As long as you turn in everything on time and participate in her class youll get an easy A.
9344,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,5.0,1.0,"THIS PROFESSOR IS SO AWESOME!!! I LOVE HER CLASS SO MUCH, TO THE POINT WHERE I MADE AN EFFORT TO FIT HER IN MY SCHEDULE FOR THE FOLLOWING SEMESTER FOR THE SECOND PART!!"
9345,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0100,4.0,4.0,"She is very concise with her lecturing, and actually helped me understand math a whole lot better versus other teachers I've taken. There is MyMathLab HW throughout the semester but it provides a good foundation for a passing grade. Small quizzes on every first lecture of the week as well. Tests have no surprises. Final exam is cumulative."
9346,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,5.0,2.0,"Ms. Riojas was very attentive and involved. She gives tons of group projects, but most are done in class. She's a tough grader on grammar but is extremely lenient with your work. Observation hours are a must and she doesn't let you get them all done with one teacher. Overall, she's great!"
9347,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher!
9348,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,4.0,2.0,She's really nice but a little strict. She does give kind of a lot of homework but nothing too hard or impossible! Get there on time and DON'T fall behind!!! But overall she's a good teacher!
9349,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,5.0,2.0,"simply the best! but you must manage your time wisely because she does give a lot of work, nothing to hard but if you procrastinate it will be a little too much. she is a great teacher she really knows how to teach and explain everything... highly recommend her"
9350,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDU1301,4.0,3.0,With mrs. riojas i learned a lot! and she explains it in a easy way to understand! she helps a lot and i loved her class! she shows you that she cares. you will work for your grade but her class is fun!
9351,1248124,Ana,Riojas,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,EDUC1301,5.0,3.0,"she is a great teacher, she is the best i ever had."
9353,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,4.0,3.0,"He's cool, You need to purchase simnet for $90 and he provides the link. You do lots of lessons on there. You have to really watch the videos and then try it by yourself. You should pay attention because then assigns handouts to recreate. Exams are okay, most are on quizlet. If you time to spare, I say go for it. If you need help, he replies fast!"
9354,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,3.0,"He's a good teacher, the software is difficult to learn, but he gives you many attempts for exams. He also gives you feedback on handouts with plenty of time to change and turn back in. At the end of the semester he posts everything back up in case you missed any assignments and gives you like 2 weeks to finish. I really liked this professor."
9355,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"Good online class! summer 1 would take it again. You just need to buy an online program for the work, but that is it. easy A"
9356,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,"easy A, just do the homework and do not skip class ;)"
9357,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,4.0,2.0,Recommend this professor definitely an easy A online or over the summer online everything is straightforward and due weekly. Assignments very easy
9358,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,1.0,2.0,"Powerpoint project,pick good ppl/show up sign in and do nothing/easy class/don't learn/BOOK NESSASARY/most of the work is done online/Test are online, can use book/His helper does all the explaining and helping/tries to be funny/tough grader on worksheets/basic work like Microsoft word,powerpoint,access,excel/very easy to pass with an A/"
9359,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,1.0,5.0,"Do not choose this professor!! he's very unteachable!!! He won't help you but his assistants will, pathetic excuse for an instructor!!"
9360,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,2.0,4.0,This professor will drop you if you miss more than 3 classes regardless if it is a emergency. He doesnt teach. He doesnt help. His lab assistant does more help than he does. If he doesnt like you he will make it obvious. Relies way to much on MyITlab
9361,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,2.5,1.0,"NO EXCUSE FOR FAILING,  It's simple, show up and do the work, keep up with the work! show up on class assignments, if you don't you wont be able to redo them, you get ""chubby zero,"" he expects you to learn the work on your own, he will only help you on certain things. he gives second tries for tests. on chapter exams, he lets you use the book."
9362,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,4.5,1.0,I would recommend this professor for anyone who wants someone laid back and relaxed easy to pass just do your assignments and he allows us to use our notes or books for exams
9363,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,4.5,2.0,Great professor by far!! Laid back this class is not for lazy bums so you have to do your assignments and take notes which you can use during the exams plus the book
9364,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,MICROCOMPUTER,3.5,1.0,easy class got a B but didnt put much effort to get the A he is a good instructor basic work keywords simple computer work excel word powerpoint nothing hard if you know how to manage a computer
9365,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,1301,5.0,1.0,Easy as 123! But quite challenging just do most of the assignments and study hard
9366,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,"Daily handouts. Make sure you write notes when doing the trainings. You’ll receive quiz/exam grades instantly. My only complaint is the group project. He assigns it early on, so make sure you choose wisely where you sit in class because the three people sitting in your row will be your partners."
9367,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,4.5,2.0,He gave us our grade before holiday and I am very happy to take Professor Molki’s class
9368,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,4.0,3.0,Perfect teacher
9369,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,1.0,"easy instructor just show up to class, do your work and you got an easy a. Super easy class."
9370,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,4.5,1.0,"A+ in his class, awesome instructor, funny, helps a lot, easy test just STUDY... overall an awesome class do your work &amp; GO HOME &amp; DRINK COFFEE !!"
9371,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,5.0,2.0,He is a really cool and playful teacher. I really recommend this teacher!
9372,666138,Saeed,Molki,South Texas College (all campuses),Computer Science,COSC1301,1.0,1.0,He's a jerk. All your work will be done on myitlab. Attendance is VERY mandatory especially since he gives out handouts during almost every class. Take the class if you want an easy A just don't get in his way.
9374,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2402,1.0,4.0,"He may be a good face-to-face teacher, BUT during COVID online classes hell just give notes and assignments to do on your OWN. No Zoom or anything. Very hard to teach yourself when you expected to be taught. Plus, the schedule/assignments are kind of given haphazardly. Would not recommend."
9375,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2402,5.0,2.0,Would take his class again.
9376,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,2.0,I would take his class again.
9377,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,1.0,5.0,Do not recommend this teacher whatsoever! Half the class dropped because he is all over the place. If you have the chance take it with another teacher do it! Hes nice do not get me wrong but did not learn anything!
9378,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2402,5.0,1.0,"The only way you won't pass is if you don't show up. He does all the homework in class, gives you a study guide for all the tests and will drop your lowest homework, quiz and test grade. Quizzes and tests are easy just make sure you study. He gives you a copy of your grades so you always know where you stand. I highly recommend him!!"
9379,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,2.0,He does the homework with you in class so all you need to do is copy him. Quiz with 10 questions each week. 4 tests &amp; the final exam. At the end of the semester he drops the lowest quiz &amp; homework grades. You have to buy the my math lab access code for $100+ that will only be used to print out the H.W. Use the free trial to print all the H.W.
9380,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACC2301,5.0,2.0,"Took this course for Summer 1 session and it was just a little challenging for myself. If you show up to class everyday, take notes, and pay attention to lecture you should be good. Gives you everything you need to know for quizzes and exams in advance, there are no surprise questions. HIGHLY recommend Prof. Jasso for this course!!"
9381,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,3.0,3.0,"Gonna be honest all the comments underneath me are boot lickers who got an ""A"". Do notnwaste your time in this class. It is an easy A, but the teach has NO and i mean NO modifation for his class. Trust me man, you will be asleep not even half way througg the class."
9382,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,3.0,"Just show up to class and take notes!  He gives 30 minutes before a quiz to study.  Just study his review, which he gives you the answers for, and you will pass with an A.  Reports are hard, but study them a few times before the test.  Currently have a 95 in his class.  Exempt from test 4 and only have the final left, but I only need a D to keep A"
9383,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,1.0,Professor Jasso is by far the GREATEST Accounting teacher at STC! He knows so much about Accounting and is very good and fair in grading. I highly recommend everyone to take his classes if you actually want to learn about Accounting.
9384,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,4.0,"He's a great teacher, if you pay attention and study you'll easily pass"
9385,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,1.0,"To keep it simple, Mr. Jasso is a real chill guy. Probably the easiest professor I've taken. He will do the homework with you in class, and go over the review 2 weeks before the test. You have to go to class to take the notes needed for the quizzes. He tells you exactly what will be on tests and quizzes so it's an easy A if you attend daily."
9386,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2402,5.0,4.0,Professor Jasso is the best! There is alot of work but nothing he is not willing to help you with. His lectures are lengthy but all information he gives is needed for quizzes &amp; exams. This class requires you to study a lot but you will be surprised with how much you'll end up  retaining the end of the semester.
9387,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2301,4.0,3.0,He's just great! Loved the way he made me like accounting so much!
9388,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,2.0,"The best professor I ever choose for financial accounting, I'm a business major and his class is not very easy but he's willing to help anyone out make sure you do your homework and study for the exams because they're long and hard Good luck!! :)"
9389,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,2.0,Really a great teacher. He goes over everything with you and if you have his questions hes more than happy to help and lets you make up quizzes if you ask. The book is online and he does take homework seriously. I took him for Financial Accounting in Fall 2015 and now taking him again in the Spring. GREAT TEACHER.
9390,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2402,4.5,2.0,"really organize teacher, easy homeworks may use the textbook online. the 4 test are no that hard just need to study a lot. quizzes are easy if you study the notes he gives you. no extra credit but your lowest test grade is pick up to your best test grade"
9391,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,1.0,Mr. Jasso is a great teacher and if you follow his directions you should do pretty good!
9392,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,ACCT2401,5.0,2.0,"Best syllabus ever! He is very detailed and has the whole semester spelled out. You will know what you're doing and when the exams/quizzes/homework is due. Straight forward, no surprises. Tells you what you need to study. Study the notes and study guide, do  your homework. Easy if you do what's required. Online access required. I highly recommend!"
9393,743859,Reynaldo,Jasso,South Texas College (all campuses),Accounting,2401,5.0,3.0,Best professor I've taken for accounting class!
9395,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,4.0,4.0,This class is very challenging. The study guides that she gives out are almost exactly what is given out on the test. There is a lot of HW but if you put effort into her class you will pass. She is also willing to help you if you dont understand the material.
9396,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,5.0,She is super hard she has bad accent  a lot of homework quizzes and test
9397,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,1.0,5.0,"I absolutely regret taking her class, literally I am ""learning"" all by myself, she just posted all the book chapters with some youtube videos so you have to learn all by yourself. She should be on live sessions or at least recorded sessions. It is difficult to keep on with all the homeworks, lectures and tests in just one week. Just don't take her."
9398,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,4.0,1.0,"Online Minimester. Daily Homework on My Open Math. Test for every chapter, midterm, and final were done through Respondus Lockdown. Will open work that is past due for full credit. Understanding, attendance was not mandatory but gave extra credit for perfect attendance. Went over chapters through recorded sessions. Easy to reach by email."
9399,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,4.0,4.0,"Her online college algebra class was so hard for me! However, being a 4 credit course I feel the work was fair. There are many quizzes, tests, and homework assignments but MyMathLab is great for helping you solve the answers. She grades the mid-term and final fair because if the answer is wrong you will still get points if the steps are right."
9400,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1332,1.0,5.0,Worst professor I had all semester hard grader takes so many points of for little things if its not her way its wrong.
9401,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,1.0,5.0,"Never take this Proffesor again. she gives out many homework plus is a tough grader. will take off points for any little thing, plus will give out a lot of exams plus a midterm and final. her reviews are 100 problems long and the test is only 10 questions. DO NOT TAKE HER"
9402,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,1.0,5.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER!!!! SHE IS A TOUGH GRADER, RUDE, AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT HER STUDENTS. SHE GIVES 4 EXAMS, A MIDTERM AND A FINAL DURING A SUMMER COURSE. LOOK FOR ANOTHER PROFESSOR ."
9403,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,3.0,3.0,good teacher.
9404,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,2.0,3.0,"She is tough. I took her class for summer 2. She assigns lots of homework and a test for every section. She assigned 9 things 3 days before finals. We took a test the day before the final. She is an extremely tough grader. She takes off points for the littlest of things. She also says ""isn't it?"" a lot."
9405,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,1.0,5.0,"Don't take her online classes if you're not good at math! I though I'd be able to work through her class but I just got an F in her class. Lots of hw every week and you basically have to teach yourself because all the math lab videos are out of date, super old recordings."
9406,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,4.0,3.0,Very simple and direct. Lessons correlates to your homework assignments.
9407,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALGEB1414,4.0,3.0,"Great teacher overall. She teaches very detailed and structured and takes you step my step along the way. However, if you miss class youll miss out on a major part of the discussion for the day that will affect your homework, since the lesson corrallates to the homework"
9408,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,4.0,3.0,"Really good professor, easy to understand and if you dont , she takes her time to explain it to you again :)"
9409,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1332,3.0,4.0,I would advise not to take an online math course unless you're really good at it. I am horrible at math and I had to teach myself and it was extremely difficult I am barely passing the course. I advise to maybe take her in person or take another professor. LOTS OF WORK! Be prepared to have 50+ assignments if you take her.
9410,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,2.0,5.0,"DO NOT PICK HER CLASS IF YOU NEED EXTRA ATTENTION IN MATH! She doesnt go in depth when she lectures, then moves on to the next objective."
9411,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1425,2.0,4.0,"Not the best teacher if math isn't your strongest subject. Only went over each lesson once, and each class had multiple lessons so felt a bit rushed on everything. Everything is done on MyMathLab. Not the best professor I've had thus far."
9412,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,1.0,4.0,"If you're not good at math DONT take this class. Was very hard for me, didn't understand her accent very well, she's VERY RUDE! She doesn't care if you're struggling, just reccomends you get tutored lol! Hated this class DONT DO IT!"
9413,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1332,3.0,3.0,"This class was okay, but it could have been better, she did email back when need of help, but if this isn't your strong subject, I would suggest to go in a lecture class or even to the CLE for tutoring. MyMathLab was kind of tricky."
9414,832031,Lily Rajendra,Rai,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1442,2.0,4.0,"She goes through Pearson's power points to teach during lectures, but students can download them through blackboard (her lectures can very boring ). Students are required to purchase an access code for MyMathLab, so they can read the textbook and complete assignments. Depending on your experience of My Math Lab, this may be the class for you."
9416,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,His grading is all over the place but one thing that is constant is that he does not really give out As because he believes there is always room for improvement. His feedback is usually a one word response with no details on how to improve. He is very rude when you ask him a question. You will need to read a lot if taken online webcam is required
9417,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,2.0,3.0,He gives lots of oppurtunities for extra credit but prepare to lose an extra 2 hours of each week for it. His class is easy if you're a good note taker and/or have a good memory. He's kinda flighty and takes a while to return grades and never explains how he grades essays. There are worse history instructors but he wouldn't be my first choice.
9418,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,1.0,3.0,"Took him during the summer and was disappointed in how he does things. Though he does provide extra credit he mostly does it right after class, so students who have other classes after his do not get the same opportunity to raise their grades. No feedback on essays and slow to grade"
9419,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,2.0,3.0,I took his class online hoping it would be easy but it turns out to be more than I thought. when you do the writing assignments if you use a different source other than his make no sense articles and the book you will get a low grade. not to mention he is rude as well and he is slow as ever when it comes to grades.
9420,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"You need to pay very close attention to the professors lectures. To be prepared for lectures you would need to print the lectures online, no book needed. He is very funny and cool. He gives chances for extra credit and make sure you take advantage of it. He is a strict grader and gives a multiple choice plus essay in exams."
9421,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,Mr. Garcia is the best professor I've taken for history. He makes lecture very interesting. And he's cute ;-)
9422,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,Mr. Garcia was the best History professor I've ever taken. I loved his class! He always made lecture interesting. He made it impossible for anyone to fail!
9423,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,4.0,"I took Mr. Garcia online for a minimester. He as a professor is great but taking him online for a minimester is hard. 8 modules 8 essays, 1 discussion per module, 1 quiz. You NEED the books. A lot of reading but if you take an entire semester it'll be easier because you'll have more time. If you work for it you can get an A."
9424,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST101,1.0,4.0,Don't take his class!! Super hard test half of the class drop and the other half passed barely with C or F. Take it with some one else better.
9425,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"simple, attendance is a must.  A lot of material but he makes it very interesting and entertaining. Weird sense of humor and sarcastic beyond belief. Extra loud but helpful at 8am. Lots of extra credit. No book needed just review your power points plenty of times and you will pass.  You wont regret taking his class if you put in the effort."
9426,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Read his rating here before registering and i have no regrets. He has awesome lectures, he is a heavy tester but you will learn so many interesting things. Super Recommend!!!!!"
9427,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"His class was so easy to me.  Mr. Garcia is amazing. You will enjoy his class even if you don't like history. He is loud and will keep you awake and entertained. He makes you learn. Pay attention, take notes, review them before each exams. Study takes it times, so be patient. no textbook needed. Good luck! Easy A, little effort, lots of knowledge."
9428,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,AMAZING AMAZING PROFESSOR!!! You can not go wrong! A lot of information given through his lectures but the way he lectures catches your attention heavily! If you're not ready to study hard and work hard you're not ready for this professor.
9429,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,4.0,3.0,"He's really really really loud.. lol I like him but if you don't pass 2 of the 4 tests he gives you, you're done. Also a lot of extra credit."
9430,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Garcia is an amazing teacher! His lectures are awesome and he's hilarious! You need to work for your grade, but he helps you out as much as possible. I highly recommend him!"
9431,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Garcia is a wonderful professor! He is very enthusiastic and shows a lot of interest for the subject. He explain everything very well and makes lectures interesting. Offers a lot of extra credit. Four total exams that require a lot of studying. However, if you pay attention in class you should have NO problem. He replies to messages quickly too"
9432,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,Mr Garcia is an amazing teacher He makes the class very interesting You will not fall asleep He explains material very well and takes a lot of interest in the subject You will not be surprised with new material on test you have a study guide and what's on the guide will be on the test If you listen well you will not fail Self explanatory
9433,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"I highly recommend for students to take Mr. Garcia  I honestly learned more about history in his class then in any other classes I've taken in the past, he takes the time to help you understand the material and overall a great teacher, I got a B in his class even though History has always been the subject I  have the most trouble with"
9434,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,Mr. Garcia is probably the best professor I've had by far! I recommend him to every one I know!
9435,1287963,Fred,Garcia,South Texas College (all campuses),History,HIIST1301,2.5,4.0,"I took Mr. Garcia's class in the Fall. You will complete 8 modules. In the modules you will write 2 essay a papers, do a quiz and will need to do discussion comments. Its not a hard class but you will need to work for your grade. He does not answer emails consistently. He is a bit rude. You will need the books!"
9437,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2401,2.0,5.0,"Many assignments &amp; they were all over the place. He was not clear in explaining what he wanted due, and when anyone emailed him for clarification, he basically said for us to go and reread the rules. I do not like leaving ratings if they aren't good, but if you have other options for A&amp;P I recommend taking another professor."
9438,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,1.0,3.0,"The quizzes and exam answers can be found online. There aren't any lectures just useless powerpoints. The final is an essay about 15 chapters and 5-10 pages. He doesn't respond to blackboard messages until a week later. Nothing is graded until the end, only the quizzes and exams are graded automatically. The seminars are abut health stuff now."
9439,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,1.0,1.0,"He is good at teaching, however he does makes you attend seminars throughout the semester, and gives a research paper with 2-3 weeks to complete it. He doesn't really teaches, all he does its read the power points word by word. Not good at explaining. He won't answer messages through black board."
9440,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,1.0,4.0,quiz every week and exam every 3 weeks powerpoints provided will not be enough information to pass so just read the chapter and skip his powerpoints. Final is 5 topics you learned about 1 to 2 pages each topic so 5 to 10 pages. He doesnt update your grades at all and wont grade seminars or discussions till the end and his grading criteria changes.
9441,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,4.0,2.0,Dr. Tamayo is very passionate about his line of work. Mostly all the assignments are on blackboard. He gives a clear schedule at the beginning of the semester. You take a quiz for every chapter due Fridays @ 5 pm. Exam is every 3 chapters also due Fridays @ 5 pm. There's 4 seminars to attend (1 per month) on Sundays. Easy A if you apply yourself.
9442,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,1.0,5.0,Never answers email nor calls. Is almost never there when you go visit him in person. He makes you attend seminars in person even though this is an online class. None of the instructions on his assignments are clear. Everything is due at 5 on Friday so if you have a job GOOD LUCK. Is it that hard to make things due at 11:59 pm? Wouldnt take again!
9443,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2401,1.0,4.0,"Monotone, assignments are all over the place, he confuses himself and involves his religious beliefs in his lectures, even incorporated his religion into the final. His lectures are pretty much just him reading off a powerpoint and he never clarifies anything. Practicals are 100 questions in 30 min. Weekend seminars at his church are for a grade."
9444,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1322,1.0,3.0,"The class is doable if you have time to read, teach yourself, and go to seminars. I was able to get an A, but it did take a lot of my time. Due dates always change and grades hardly posted until the very end. The last test was 7 days ago and I'm still waiting on grades. smh"
9445,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,2.0,3.0,Would not recommend. Gets off topic way too much and assignments and due dates are always moved and scattered.
9446,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL2401,1.0,4.0,Don't take him.
9447,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,4.0,3.0,"I took nutrition online minimester with Dr Tamayo. He opens up all the assignments at once and you get to go through them as you see fit. Everything is due at the end of the semester. 1 12 pg research paper, 1 nutritional plan and 1 set of questions to answer as a special assignment. I did not due the research ppr &amp; got a B. Easy class"
9448,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,5.0,1.0,"Great Professor, Do what you're supposed to and it will be a easy A, he gives plenty of time to turn in work. Would definitely take him again."
9449,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,5.0,2.0,"The homework is very easy, clear and the professor is always their to help when you need it."
9450,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIOL1322,4.0,3.0,Online class is easy. 3-4 quizzes followed by a test. All are open since the beginning of class so you can get ahead. Has discussion questions for extra credit. He does require a 12 page report with a power point and a 7 day menu with recipes. Not hard at all. Easy A.
9451,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,2.0,"He's a very goo professor. hes very understanding as well. his lecture tests are online but his lab preacticle are in class, they can be hard if you didn't study. The book is needed though and his grading isn't that tough"
9452,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO2401,1.0,4.0,"Tough instructor. Has an accent which makes it difficult to understand. His 3 hr. lectures are based on some poorly made power points. Quizzes/Exams are bad, he expects you to know things based on what he thinks is right instead of what's on the textbook. What's the point of purchasing a textbook if he contradicts what is written?"

9454,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,3.0,3.0,"Book is needed gor noline quizzes and the one research paper at the end. He has some meetings certain sundays and those are part of the grade, so must attend. I thought it was easy and honestly did try and ended up with a B. He is nice, but the class is kind of boring... :/"
9455,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,3.5,4.0,"He will make class stay all the time required, very nice but to demanding, 12 page essay too much especially if we as students have other classes. A bit of an accent, but you can understand him. Attendance is mandatory, but he understands if things happen in personal life."
9456,1007315,Edwin,Tamayo,South Texas College (all campuses),Biology,BIO1322,1.0,4.0,I took a class this Fall and it was the worst! He NEVER responds to emails nor communicates. He makes you buy the book NEW when you can actually have a USED one. His assignments and tests have due times very early and are hard to meet  if you have a job. He also REQUIRES you to assist to seminars in person throught the semester on Sundays!!
9458,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,5.0,3.0,Professor replies to questions FAST!
9459,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,4.0,2.0,"AMAZING professor! NO homework.4 tests with reviews. 1 final. Stops to explain again, if you need help still. He doesn't respond to emails tho. But overall great professor. He makes it fun."
9460,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,1.0,5.0,"Very nice person. Only reads of projector which has examples ,but he only reads them and doesnt do them by hand which isnt helpful at all and you learn nothing. He lets you works in groups all semester except on final which again isnt helpful at all. You waste your time in class because you end up at the CLE after class."
9461,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,2.0,Ive taken so many math courses with various professors at STC and UTRGV after taking him and I truly believe hes the best math professor Ive ever had. I took him in the summer and somehow he made each lesson go by fast yet I always walked out feeling like I actually learned and understood. I recommend him to anyone who asks me
9462,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,5.0,3.0,"Be present, pay attention and ask questions to understand the class. Ethridge will answer your questions and help you. Go to SI support and CLE for tutoring. He didn't require the book, you will print out papers you need from Blackboard. The class is slow in the beginning but goes fast in the end, don't fall behind. Put in the work,not too hard."
9463,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,4.0,3.0,"If math isnt your favorite subject Id recommend attending as many of his classes as possible. Hes very thorough &amp; lets you work in groups on exams, except for the final. I failed my previous algebra class because I was so lost. I passed his class with a B. Hes always willing to help &amp; he provides the textbook."
9464,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1414,5.0,2.0,I honestly love this professor and would love to take more math classes from him. He gives a clear understanding of the very basics of math all the way to the depths of algebra. I took him in the summer and although it was very fast paced because of summer it was so easy.
9465,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,3.0,2.0,"This professor is very knowledgeable in his field and expands his answer to peoples questions, but he makes everything appear harder than it is. When he explains something, he expects you to understand the concept right away and even though you might not get it, you are too intimidated to ask again. I basically survived by going to CLE tutoring."
9466,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1414,5.0,3.0,"extremely funny, makes class very interesting, and makes math easy to understand, he takes his time to explain the context at extreme detail. If you are good at math, you might even get a little frustrated because you are like ""OK we got it"" but for those who have a harder time to understand its good. Tests are w/partners extra credit &amp; HW online."
9467,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1414,5.0,3.0,Summer Class I did not go often and was not able to catch up! I still passed! The grade was composed of 4 exams and 4 Hw. Exams are group and homework are taken online. I hate math but I would take the class again just to get a better grade!
9468,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,5.0,2.0,Good
9469,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1425,3.0,4.0,"lets you work w with a partner for exams, and provides a general cheat sheet. He LOVES math but isn't that great with providing additional examples when asked. he gives 2 to 3 then you're on your own. If you don't get additional help if your lost, you will fail."
9470,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1414,5.0,2.0,"This professor is amazing, he goes into detail and makes sure everyone understands him! After exam he lets you do corrections for extra points, you cannot fail this class. He drops the lowest exam. He gives you the book on blackboard! Easy A, I haven't passed a math course in a long time, and I FINALLY DID. TAKE HIM!!!!! I loved this class"
9471,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,5.0,2.0,"Suck at math? Then I recommend you to take this class with Professor Etheridge; I've sucked at math my entire life and I'm passing this class with an A. The homework is online due on the day of the test, for the first four tests you can have a partner help you, and there are corrections for the tests which help a lot, the final is comprehensive."
9472,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,5.0,1.0,Best teacher ever!
9473,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,5.0,2.0,"He's hilarious, he is really good at explaining and doesn't let the class go boring. He makes funny comments and is really smart. You can skip class all you want, he doesn't take attendance. He will help you a lot, he drops the lowest grade. The homework and study guides are the same as the exams so the class is really easy."
9474,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1350,5.0,2.0,"I highly recommend this class. This teacher is very understanding and allows you to work in partners for the exams except the final. He makes this class super easy especially if you are struggling with math. He also has a good sense of humor. There is homework that needs to be done, but it is online."
9475,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1350,5.0,3.0,"Not very good at math, but had it on lock with this professor! He's caring, funny and definitely not boring. He lets you take tests in groups/ with a partner and has you take the final alone. Doesn't give study guides but gives you homework with the material that will be on the following quiz a week before. Would take again! Plus he's a qt!"
9476,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,5.0,2.0,"Very funny teacher , explains things very well . i will take him again"
9477,1516666,Reid,Etheridge,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,ALG1414,3.0,3.0,the best algebra class ive taken! he is understanding for the most part but he does teach fairly fast. Very helpful. He has his own book that he will post on blackboard. Test are not the worst if you study and he lets you work in groups for test.
9479,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2413,1.0,2.0,A very bad professor. Do not recommend. His class isnt hard but if you get a good grade then he will automatically become suspicious and report you to the school for no reason. He wont want to help you on homeworks either. Either way do not recommend very bad professor.
9480,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,5.0,3.0,He is very good at what he does. I don't understand why these recent reviews are bad. If its an online class obviously be prepared to change your learning style. I want to take him again for Cal 1. The only reason why the recent reviews are bad is because those people didn't spend the time needed to actually learn the material. Recommend!!!!!!!!!!!
9481,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH2412,1.0,5.0,"I took the class online due to the reason I had not other choice, but Im going to put this simply he will not teach the class you the student responsible for learning the material. If you have a job do not even take the class because you will not have time to do both and he will not cut you some slack. So its either be a student or have a job."
9482,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH1414,1.0,3.0,He is not understanding at all. He was very disrespectful towards me and the way I learn. I felt discriminated against whenever I contacted him for help. I see a lot of good feedback of him but when I took his class all I saw from him was the opposite.
9483,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,2.0,"Highly recommend professor Getso! I've always disliked math but he puts it into terms where you will understand. He sends out step by step guides to help you with difficult homework, quizzes, and tests. A+ professor!"
9484,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,2.0,"Overall a pretty solid dude. He's pretty clear about what he's teaching, although sometimes it's pretty hard to hear him, the content itself is still clear nonetheless. If you want to get a good grade, constantly show go up to the board and do example problems. He'll take notice and give generous extra credit for that."
9485,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,1.0,4.0,"When creating your course schedule please look into other professors. Puts a bunch of questions on the board, expecting you to answer them for him. Makes students feel foolish for asking questions, or getting an answer wrong. Gives too many exams, and never posts grades. You can learn so much more on YouTube, in a short amount of time."
9486,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,P30,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Getso encourages everyone to never quit, he is a very inspirational person, he will take extra steps for you to learn, and makes math learning enjoyable. Always do your homework, participation is a must, and you will achieve your goals in his class. I will highly recommend him."
9487,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH200,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! Really outgoing person, would totally recommend."
9488,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,4.0,"Getso is awesome he will help as much as he can , he is always open to answer questions regarding the material , he is funny and if he sees you try he will help you out ! Go to the board and get problems done and dont be afraid to ask questions or to e mail him he is always there to help , study hard and you will pass his class !"
9489,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0100,4.0,2.0,"Took him online for Math100 during summer11. The book is not required as you will need to purchase MyMathLab online interactive program but I used it. It was helpful to study and review as you will be self-taught. You will be graded on homework, two practice exams, a midterm and the final exam. Note, Midterm and Finals are on campus."
9490,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH090,4.0,4.0,"Im not good at math at all, and i decided to take Mr. Getsos class for math 100, he is a really good teacher the only thing is i had to learn how to do everything by myself he does not post videos on how to do the work! Also i wish he would offer extra credit."
9491,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,2.0,Great person!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9492,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,2.0,"MrGetso has been the greatest math teacher I have had, he really helps you understand the math problems even if your not good with math trust me you will learn in this class hes a big help and really nice its such an easy class to pass if you really pay attention"
9493,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,2.0,Can I say amazing. I hate math because I can never understand it. he helped me a lot and that's because I used online classes. I Haven't studied math in like 7 years and somehow he would help a lot for me to understand math I feel more confident than ever thank you mr. Getso there should be more professors with your ways of teaching and thinking.
9494,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH200,5.0,2.0,Never met someone so excited to teach a math class. He's hilarious and does an outstanding job going over the material. I recommend him for anyone that struggles in math or anyone who actually wants to learn. I'm definitely going to try and take him in the future!!!
9495,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH100,4.0,1.0,"Awesome teacher! He has a big heart and is very caring! Attendence is not mandatory but i suggest you go everytime. He helps out alot, so ask him anything you may not understand. He wants everyone to be successful in math and makes it easier for those who struggle with it. Take him!"
9496,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH100,5.0,1.0,REALLY GOOD TEACHER!! HELPS ALOT WHEN YOU NEED HELP. I REALLY LEARNED ALOT THIS SEMESTER
9497,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0200,5.0,1.0,"He is AMAZING! Class is easy and he would let us out of class early , if you want to pass the class just do the assigments in my mathlab and you are guaranteed an A"
9498,712478,Richard,Getso,South Texas College (all campuses),Mathematics,MATH0100,5.0,2.0,Totally recommend him for anyone needing this class. Thought i was bad at math and it didnt like me but taking his class helped me and now im really good at math. Very excellent with his teaching skills . He will take his time helping and explaning problems to you until you get it . Wish i could take him for all my math classes
9500,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1301,4.0,3.0,Just do the extra credits and youll pass.
9501,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,4.0,"A great Professor! His class consist of 4 exams which have reviews and reviews are for extra credit to your exam if done. We did write a lot of notes, but you must write them because he doesn't put them on Blackboard. He also had us present to the class about our favorite gem/mineral/volcano we liked the most. Funny and great professor over all."
9502,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,3.0,"Great professor! He is fair and pay attention the first day. He will tell you exactly what you can expect for the semester, no surprises! If you work hard, an A is attainable. He is available outside of class."
9503,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,3.0,"He is the best Geology teacher out there, he cares so much for his students!! I would 100% take his class again"
9504,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,PHYS1415,5.0,2.0,Awesome teacher! Lots of note taking lectures are not boring. If you don't study you wont pass. LOTS of extra credit.
9505,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,3.0,4.0,He makes you buy the lab manual. he does make you take a lot of notes but he gives you more than enough time to write them down. I would recommend that you bring your laptop to take notes because of the study guides(70+ questions) that way you can copy and paste them. study guides worth points for test. a 3 page research paper
9506,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1301,5.0,4.0,"Samrt, really knows stuff. Loves geology. Things look different going down the road after this class."
9507,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,4.0,3.0,"I got an A in this class and science has never been my thing. Really not that hard if you study with flash cards, that you have to do anyway for the extra credit which he offers A LOT of. There are many extra credit opportunities. If you study the reviews you will pass the tests. Not that hard. Dont expect to just look over the notes and pass."
9508,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,1.0,4.0,Those of you looking to take a less difficult course than other sciences like biology.. this is not the teacher you should get. He NEVER puts grades in. He does not put the notes on BB. He changes the material from the review for exams. There's over 70+ questions on the review &amp; only 50 on the actual exam. THIS CLASS IS A WASTE OF TIME.
9509,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,2.0,"A LOT OF NOTES!! You go through 20+ slides full of notes each class. He gives lots of extra credit, also on exams. When you finish a lab he checks it and tells you which ones to correct till you get it right. There were 4 exams. 1 essay and 1 presentation. He is a really cool professor I recommend him!!"
9510,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,3.0,4.0,"If you're looking for an easy A, this isn't it. Physical Geology with Doney wasn't the most difficult class, but you did have to put in the work if you want an A. He's definitely fair. He gives a lot of extra credit, and it's on the student if they don't take advantage. Didn't need the main book, just the lab one. Make sure to do your study guides."
9511,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,2.0,"Mr Doney is AMAZING! He's funny, and gives LOTS of extra credit, on exams for your final grade as well. The notes aren't so bad, just take your laptop. On the final, he let's u use a ""cheat sheet"" which is 1 page front and back with the notes for that exam. Turn everything in, you should be okay! Easy class! Take him, you wont regret it!"
9512,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1301,4.0,3.0,"He was the bomb! He's funny, and gives extra credit before every exam, and for your overall course grade. The notes to me weren't so bad, but you do NEED them.  On the final, he let us use a ""cheat sheet"" which is 1 page front and back with the notes for that exam. Basically, if you put in work and turn everything in, you should be okay!"
9513,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1301,5.0,2.0,"His teaching method is great. Yes you take a lot of notes but everything on your notes is on your quizzes. All he requires is the geology workbook labs are easy test are a little long but he gives you extra credit before the test to do. The final he lets you have a ""cheat sheet"" which means you can use notes but it can only be 1 page front and back"
9514,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,1.0,"I love how well he describes the subject in great detail. He's approachable if you have more questions,  he is fair, and will explain to you what you need in order to do well in class."
9515,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,4.0,4.0,"Summer class. Great teacher. Lectures are interesting. LOTS of extra credit offered. Do the study guides before the exams and you'll pass the class. Lots of note taking. Graded on 4 test, labs, and research paper no text book needed, just the lab manual. DO NOT miss class, you'll miss way too many notes."
9516,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,2.0,"Great professor! I took Physical Geology in the summer and got an A.  At first was kind of sceptical about Geology but he made it really interesting, I learned a lot. There is a lot of note taking however he gives you lots of time to take down notes. Recommend taking laptops. He also gives extra credit if needed. Would highly recommend Mr. Doney."
9517,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,2.0,"Awesome professor!!! i sincerely learned a lot !! And I enjoyed his class, very funny. I totally recommend this professor"
9518,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEO1403,4.0,2.0,one of the best professors i have ever taken. I usually hate science but his class was always fun to go to. definitely recommend for physical geology and historical geology. just be ready to take notes but very easy and fun class. only uses lab manual not actual textbook but he recommends to rent the manual
9519,913691,Carl,Doney,South Texas College (all campuses),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Doney is one of the most easiest professors I've ever taken. His lectures are very long 3 hours of note taking. But his labs are supper easy, and if you keep asking him question he will practically give you the answer. He give you a long study guide before the exams, but its optional and if you complete it he give you 10-15 point on the exam!!"
9521,976593,Ricardo,Rodriguez,South Texas College (all campuses),College Success,COLLEGESUCCESS,5.0,2.0,"Hes awesome,never have to worry about failing his class. I would take 100 times if I could."

9530,976593,Ricardo,Rodriguez,South Texas College (all campuses),College Success,EDCS0101,5.0,1.0,"Amazing professor, lectures are super simple and fun. I see a lot of peoplw say they didnt learn much in terms of college prep, but honestly, if you pay attention and learn, not memorize, the stuff he teaches, you're already learning more than other students are. I definitely recommend his class to absolutely anyone."
9531,976593,Ricardo,Rodriguez,South Texas College (all campuses),College Success,EDCS0101,5.0,1.0,Can you say best teacher ever I mean he cares so much for each student... he understands what every person is going through... he even had students who passed the tsi  and did not want to leave because he is such an amazing professor I recommend him a 100%

9537,976593,Ricardo,Rodriguez,South Texas College (all campuses),College Success,ORIN0101,2.5,1.0,"He's cool, but for a college orientation teacher, I don't feel that he helped new college students know how to succeed in college.  If you like to sit back, relax, and get an easy C grade, you'll do fine.  If you show any attempt of trying to get good grades, you'll pass with an A+ no problem.  You won't learn much, but I guarantee you'll have fun."
9538,976593,Ricardo,Rodriguez,South Texas College (all campuses),College Success,ORIN,5.0,2.0,"Vas a ir a pasarte un buen rato a esta clase, el profe es divertido y no hay tareas aunque si requiere el libro pero casi no lo usamos. Sus lecturas son fÃ¡ciles y es una clase que te enseÃ±a cosas de la vida. Este profesor va a dejar un gran impacto en tu vida y va a enseÃ±arte cosas que ningÃºn otro maestro en STC te podrÃ¡ enseÃ±ar. "
9539,976593,Ricardo,Rodriguez,South Texas College (all campuses),College Success,COLLEGESUCCESS,5.0,1.0,"I think just about everyone attended his class because they wanted to. His class is so much fun. You only take three tests the whole semester and that's it I swear to you that's all you do. No assignments. Book for the tests, you'll need them. Should be a comedian. He's so cool I wish all teachers were like him. BEST TEACHER EVER! NoJoke. NoRegret."
9540,976593,Ricardo,Rodriguez,South Texas College (all campuses),College Success,COLLEGESUCCESS,5.0,1.0,"Mr. Rick Rodriguez he makes learning fun, very helpfull and he likes to make jokes but it's all examples about the lecture he is giving. Wish all the instructors where like him.  I highly recommend his class you can't fail."
9542,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART2346,5.0,4.0,Took him for ceramics spring semester and loved it. He is very relatable and funny. One bad thing is he took forever to grade but it was fine because I got an A. Definitely a good guy and is willing to help you with more than just ceramics.
9543,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,4.0,2.0,"This class was so easy. Do all your work and you will be fine. He doesn't like when you're on your phone or eat in his class, but overall so easy!!"
9544,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ARTS1301,4.0,3.0,Good Professor. The class is easy if you do all the art lessons and take all 5 Test!
9545,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ARTS1301,4.0,1.0,"Overall this class was cake. Provided chapter quizzes (not a grade) &amp; let you copy the questions and answers and use on the tests. Can be condescending &amp; sometimes takes the class a bit too seriously. Attendance isn't a big deal, he states often that he won't drop you for not showing up. Will stop class to call you out for being on phone or eating."
9546,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,2.0,2.0,"Okay I will tell you all that this professorss class is easy. When I took it the material and quizzes are a breeze if you keep up. But like most comments say, there are no phones allowed, he does give breaks though. I did get a D due to not keeping up sometimes but other times he doesnt keep up with grades. But easy B-A dont be intimidated."
9547,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,1301-40765,5.0,2.0,Professor Molina is wonderful! He truly cares about you learning. The class is easy if you attend and pay attention to his PowerPoint. I would like to further my education in art due to this class. It went by way to fast in my summer session.
9548,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,5.0,1.0,"Loved this class! Very Easy!  He's great at giving feedback, All test were identical to quizzes.  If you study the quizzes you will pass!  A museum visit was required but you have all semester to complete.  Great Teacher!"
9549,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,5.0,1.0,"Very easy class if you show up, do your work and show some respect towards the professor. The assignments are straightforward from the book, which are quite easy and quick to do (if you just glance over the book tbh). Goes through the entire book and tests come verbatim from the quizs. Really values respect, so easily annoyed by phones and snacking"
9550,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1304,1.0,1.0,Teacher forgot classes started &amp; that he needed to give an assignment until the week of finals. Gave assignment we could not turn in the way he wanted due to file size made by required images. Fails to respond to communications. Refuses to accept work turned in by deadline. Has been reusing the same quiz for years and on day one i was  1 year late
9551,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,2.0,3.0,This can be an easy A if you show up and do the work. The test questions are taken from the quizzes and the only other major grade is a museum visit due at the end of the semester. His lectures are boring- he just reads from the powerpoint and book- and he gets upset over the smallest things. He is changing his attendance policy to mandatory.
9552,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,5.0,1.0,"he is grading the home work without reading any word, his tests so easy. but,he said  : i will change the tests to comprehensions next semester."
9553,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,2.0,4.0,Everything is  worth 2 points  besides test and  museum   Visits . You don't have to show up he don't care. Does not want you on your phone or eating only time you can get on phone is group work and test if you eat or get on your phone he will stop the classes tell you put it away or leave he gets mad if you step out the class to take a call
9554,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ARTS1301,3.0,3.0,"I took this course online during the summer, so I don't know how the professor is personally. MUST have the textbook. Do NOT procrastinate, the work will pile up and become a pain to complete by due date. Test questions were exactly the same as quizzes. Final exam-go to an art museum and pick various works and write your thoughts about them."
9555,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,CERAMICS1,3.0,3.0,"Eh. He's an okay professor. Sometimes he's nice when he wants to be. He gets mad when you don't ask him for help but when you do, the way he talks to you makes it seem like he thinks you're stupid. It's a pretty easy class but I would not take him again and wouldn't recommend him."
9556,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,1.0,4.0,This is the worst class I have had at TCC. He He flips out if he sees your phone. Very rude and disrespectful
9557,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,4.0,2.0,"Good teacher.  He has certain rules for class like having the book and no electronics in class unless specified, but he is still not very hard. As long as you do the homework (a lot, but simple) and a few outside assignments, you will pass. Not very hard at all.  He prefers you attend but not required. Grades on a curve.  Nice guy to be around."
9558,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,1.0,5.0,"WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD.  Be careful what you read on here, he gives extra credit if you write a good review."
9559,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,5.0,4.0,"He is a good instructor, attendance is mandatory which to me is a goos thing. I took the maymester class, pretty intense but, it worth everything. The only thing I don't like is the online acess code you have to buy."
9560,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART2346,5.0,3.0,"Great ceramics class, but for ceramics I you must follow his instructions on how and what he wants. Your creativity will be saved for Ceramics II."
9561,880945,Rafael,Molina,Tarrant County College (all),Art,ART1301,4.0,2.0,"Professor Molina is a very nice Professor. He is very fair to his student. Although there is a lot of work in his course, it adds a lot of value to the class and really builds on the material. I was not exited when told there was a mandatory museum visit, however it was actually kind of fun to go. Overall Professor Molina is a great professor"
9563,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2308,5.0,3.0,She is one of the best professors I have ever had. She responds fairly quickly. You have to put in some effort reading the chapters and powerpoints and taking notes. Powerpoints are really important and so are the videos that are used sometimes. Great professor and class is super easy if you do the work.
9564,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,2.0,3.0,She's okay but doesn't really help out or explain anything to do with the textbook. Quiz every week and she tries to trick you. I really don't enjoy this class and wouldn't recommend her.
9565,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2308,5.0,1.0,"This is my second time taking Professor Williamson! I loved her class both times! I must warn you, there will be a lot of reading! Put in the work and you'll for sure get an A"
9566,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2308,3.0,3.0,This was my first class where the textbook was not provided by the professor for an online class. This is the first online course I have taken where all the assignments were not released on the first day. Be prepared to read a lot throughout this course.
9567,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2308,5.0,2.0,"There are so many nice things I could say about her! I took this class during a short summer period, at NINE months pregnant and she was the best professor I've ever had! She cares about her students and what she is teaching. I could honestly take her class a million more times. She is awesome! If you are on the fence, TAKE HER CLASS."
9568,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2308,5.0,1.0,Dr. Williamson was the BEST. I took her for multiple psych classes and loved both of them. Her lectures are so interesting but you also learn so much. Tests are very easy if you just pay attention in class. Definitely recommend!!
9569,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2308,5.0,2.0,Took professor Williamson online and it was smooth and easy. Quizzes twice a week and occasional papers that were easy and fun to write. Midterm and Final proctored - study the quizzes and you will do great! She also drops two of your lowest quiz grades at the end of the semester and offers extra credit. Recommended professor for Child Psychology!
9570,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2308,5.0,2.0,"Loved taking her for Child Psychology! Her class is very straightforward and as long as you do your assignments and pay attention, her class is an easy A."
9571,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSCY2301,5.0,3.0,"I took a wintermester class . She is a great professor. She gives great feedback, quickly responds to emails and follows the syllabus. She also gives extra credit and drops the two lowest quiz grades. Read the chapter outlines and pay attention to what she points out to be prepared for tests/quizzes. Easy A if you apply yourself."
9572,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"If you have an opportunity to take a class with Professor Williamson, you need to jump on the opportunity. She is extremely caring and will leave feedback on every assignment - which seems to be a lost art on some professors. She outlines her expectations clearly in the syllabus and if you do the work, you will get an A."
9573,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSCH2301,5.0,3.0,Great professor. Her tests are based off the lecture outlines. She gives a lot of extra credit.
9574,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,Enjoyable teacher! Textbook isn.t needed often but will come in use for few questions on tests. She is pretty clear on what will be on the test from the lectures. Gives extra credit and bonus questions. Rarely ever gives homework.
9575,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,Dr Williamson is fantastic. Extra credit opportunity at the end of the semester. Assignments and their point values are available starting day 1. Schedule is clearly outlined before you even start the class so there's no excuse for missing work. Gives feedback on *everything* and is supportive and helpful. Would take any class she teaches.
9576,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2308,5.0,4.0,"I loved Dr. Williamson! Her class was fantastic! She gives you notes, but also expects you to read. The textbook and information were interesting, so I really enjoyed it! She is caring and easily accessible after hours. She's really nice, gives you several extra credit opportunities and drops the lowest 3 quiz grades- for our online class at least!"
9577,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSCY2301,5.0,3.0,Dr. Williamson is by far the best professor I have ever had! Her teaching style is precise and easy to understand. I took her last semester for Intro to Psychology and I'm taking her Child Psychology class in the fall because I enjoyed her class so much. I would absolutely 109% take her classes again and I would reccomend her.
9578,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,Dr. Williamson was amazing I would take any other classes she offers. I took her online class and her expectations are given to you clearly from the beginning of the semester. Be sure to read and take notes on both the text and lessons sometimes there is hidden gold in the lessons that are really helpful.
9579,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSCY2301,5.0,4.0,"She is an excellent professor, I loved her class she is also so funny! But you do have to focus on studying every day-litterally everything you learn in class is on the test"
9580,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSCH2301,5.0,2.0,"I highly recommend her to learn about psychology, professors out there that actually love what they're teaching are always the best to learn from &amp; she's a great example of that."
9581,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,I really enjoyed her class. Yes you will need to read the chapters but she takes more weight from her lectures and videos used in her lectures. She gives extra credit if you go to her during office hours and review your tests. Use her lecture guides to take notes with. She is legit wants to see you succeed in her class.
9582,943020,Angela,Williamson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSCH2301,1.0,5.0,"I do not like reading and everybody recommended this possessor wasn't for me, got a D and took an easier one without reading."
9584,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,I'm now taking his 1301 class online and I'll probably take his other class too. He gives a bunch of quizzes and gives recorded lectures that are optional. Always there in office hours. But he does require you to work. That's college. Two writing assignments that aren't hard.
9585,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST13011302,5.0,3.0,He relates the class information to his own personal life. That made him more approachable. He likes to handle things over the phone and that makes it more personal.
9586,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,5.0,2.0,"I learned a LOT in this class. Took it online during the COVID summer, so it was hard to keep up. He gives podcasts on the textbook and they really helped me. They'r optional. He lays out the course pretty well. He also called me back when I needed extra help."
9587,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,Online summer course. Very clear instructions laid out. Free textbook. Just study the materials he gives you adn read carefully. Especially the syllabus.
9588,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"I took his summer 2020 course, there were only ten graded assignments( 8 quizzes and 2 discussion boards). The discussion board were graded very hard and the quizzes were very difficult as well."
9589,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT1302,5.0,3.0,ONLINE SUMMER COURSE with 8 quizzes(800 points) and 2 DB ( 200 points) for a total of 1000 points (A+) Reading is crucial in order to do well on the quizzes. I actually learned a lot in this class and Im really glad I took Professor T
9590,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT1302,3.0,3.0,"Only two discussion boards, 8 quizzes and thats all! Work at your own pace. Grades arent uploaded till after the due date, but all quizzes are on blackboard. Free textbook too."
9591,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"Professor Tovanche is a good professor when it comes to teaching about life, but when the quiz comes around, most quiz questions are very difficult to answer due to being so similar to each other. He Has 8 quizzes and 2 essays and is a very hard I mean hard grader. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS."
9592,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,4.0,4.0,"Zero tolerance for tardiness, no shows, side talking, electronics (phones, laptops etc.)or any disruptions. Comes off as a strong hard ass but he is actually very passionate about history. He's smart, funny &amp; informative. He was the first person to mention COVID-19 to me before it hit US. He's on top of his game &amp; expects you to be too! Just read."
9593,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,Online course was good for me because I like to work on my own. Gives free textbook. Most of his tests are multiple choice but has two writing assignments. Clear syllabus gbut it's kinda long.
9594,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,3.0,5.0,He is a good teacher for those who need to prepare for the real world. I label him hard because he does not sugar coat. He will probably read this on the first day. He teaches you responsibility in your education. His material is not suppose to be hard. It is both what he lectures and what you read on your own time. He prepares you for uni.
9595,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,Took him for online class. Not a lot of discussion boards but has a couple of interesting ones. Use the free textbook and you'll be ok.
9596,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"I was scared to take Prof. Tovanche based on these reviews, but I ended up loving his class. He's strict, but fair &amp; interesting. The quizzes are difficult, but not impossible. If you hate history, find another professor because he takes it very seriously, but if you like the subject &amp; don't mind taking notes, I'd definitely recommend his class."
9597,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,"His lectures are absolutely wonderful. I took his class twice, I failed the first time because his class is based off of some quizzes in which you have around 25 minutes to answer 20 questions but they're all based off of his lecture. I failed the first time because I didn't bother reading. Reading is the key. His lectures are fun and he is honest."
9598,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"He seems to take teaching seriously. I took his online class. Everything is layed out for you, so I didn't even have to email him. I go to UTA and took this for a summer class. It wasn't that hard for me. I got a B."
9599,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST13011302,5.0,3.0,"im not sure what everyone thinks college entails? Yes, you have to read to pass (this is normal??). Yes, he wants you to show up on time (its incredibly rude not to ??). Tovanche is, and has been, one of my favorite professors. If you feel his class is too hard or that he is unfair maybe you need to take a look at the amount of effort you're giving"
9600,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Prof. T is a great lecturer. Be on time, act like a college student. He doesn't answer stuff in the syllabus so you need to read that real close. You have to read."
9601,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST13011302,5.0,3.0,"if you don't want to learn, don't take him"
9602,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,"he is not a easy, talkative teacher. this class has 8 quizzes in a semester and 3 discussion boards. the quizzes are extremely difficult and, seems to me, made to trick you. say, theres a question being asked. all answers you can choose from are the exact same except for one word making a difference. this is definitely a class i dont recommend."
9603,1177918,Juan Joel,Tovanche,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,"He is the worst professor I've ever taken. I took his class online he grades very late, his quizzes are tricky. He changes the wording from what's in the book to confuse you. BEWARE! You only have 20 minutes on test and you don't have time to review notes so you need to study extra hard."
9605,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL2316,5.0,2.0,Professor Reed was an absolute marvel. His great storytelling and keeping the lectures interesting and open for discussion. I had always been interested in Philosophy and he was the perfect guy to teach it. 110% Recommended.
9606,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,2.0,"I'm not the best at philosophy, but nonetheless it's something I really enjoy learning about. Prof. Reed does a great job at teaching it and making it fun. There's extra credit opportunities that are easy peasy, and don't fret about the short essay answers, he basically gives you the answers when he goes over the study guides in class."
9607,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,2.0,I took professor Reed PHIL-1301 during my first may-mester. He is an amazing professor who added humor and a lot of opportunities to raise your grade through extra credit to his class. His exams are around 26-27 questions long with two short answer responses he allows you to have pre-written before you take the exam. Overall would I recommend him
9608,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,2.0,"Great class for introduction to philosophy. Gives good test reviews and gives good lectures, however you do have to go over the lectures. Professor Reed is passionate about philosophy and this is an interesting class to learn about wisdom!"
9609,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,2.0,"plenty of discussion boards, a very interactive class. Professor Reed really cares and wants to empower his students with philosophy. A life-changing class in my opinion."
9610,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,3.0,Took him in his 5 week summer course. He makes the text book so you wont have to buy one. Tests are multiple choice with 1 open ended question. He will give you the questions before hand so all you have to do is copy and paste. You will read a lot but you will learn a lot. He also offers extra credit. I made a B. Great Professor.
9611,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,2.0,"Philosophy is hard. At least for me it was. Professor Reed was great though. He provided so many ways to learn the material and that really helped. He has 2 FRQ's per test, but he gives you them before the test so that you can prepare the answers before hand. He gives you plenty of chances for extra credit from the beginning of the semester."
9612,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,3.0,Awesome professor!! He is so super nice and I never dreaded gong to class. I had trouble on his test because his lectures would not stick in my head so I ended up teaching myself some. I passed his test but he does give extra credit which brought me up a WHOLE letter grade ! I must say I had an empty feeling leaving the final exam :( ill miss him!
9613,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,3.0,"This professor is great. He uses his own material so need need to get a book. He gives 30 points in extra credit!! His lectures are wonderful and the class discussion help so much!! The test are 15 multiple choice and 15 true/ false, with one essay. He even gives you the essay questions a head of time. Great great professor can not say enough, A+++"
9614,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,3.0,"I loved this class and professor Reed is so entertaining and gives great lectures and scenarios to actually allow you to learn. I was worried going in but the tests are not too hard if you go to class, listen, take notes and go over them before the test. He gave 30 points extra credit and dropped a test to help us out! Very understanding guy!!!"
9615,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,2.0,"Reed is a good guy funny too, i really enjoyed this class even at first i thought i would hate it. If i had to take another philosophy-esque class again i would take him. I highly recommend him. How to pass? read the notes and study the review easy."
9616,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,1.0,"Took his online Philosophy class during Summer 1 and really enjoyed it. Fairly easy class. There should be no reason to obtain anything less than an A. Quizzes and Exams are based on the material provided, there's not book needed, and allows more than enough extra credit up to 30 points. Drops a quiz and exam. I would definitely take again."
9617,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,4.0,"THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR! I loved his philosophy class. He wants to corrupt the youth and surprisingly he does haha. He is hilarious, he has good amount of extra credit, 5 tests drops one; 25 multiple choice and 1 essay. Plus some cool assignments that make you question a lot. If you're open minded you will love this class."
9618,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,2.0,"Really good teacher, he was cool and if you need help he's always there. interesting class discussions. I missed a lot of classes and still ended up with a B. he gives reviews and has a whole day he goes over them. He gives 4 test and he drops ur lowest one plus there is a non comprehensive final."
9619,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,2.0,Mr. Reed has become one of my favorite professors. I really wish that I could continue taking him for more classes. The textbook is free since writes it himself and there are 5 exams. One the lowest grades out of the first four will be replaced the fifth exams exam which is the final but it is non comprehensive.
9620,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL2303,4.0,1.0,"Textbook necessary, both to learn and for HW. 10 HW assignments from the book spread through the semester. 5 Unit Exams. You'll want to attend class, as some of the concepts in the book are not immediately intuitive, and you'll want to talk about them. Reed is pretty laid back, and willing to banter and discuss random things if not behind schedule."
9621,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,1.0,"No textbook to buy. All material online. While it's probably not necessary to show up every class, you would be missing out on a LOT of interesting discussions. Class itself is very easy. I took no notes and didn't really study, and still got an A. 5 Unit Exams (including final), 2 critical thinking assignments, and 1 reflection assignment."
9622,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,4.0,3.0,"Great online class, read the lesson notes and you should find all the answers to the quizzes and exams there. Gives you a study guide with three questions for you to answer so you can already have them done by the time the exam comes. easy class, you juts have to read notes and participate in discussion boards."
9623,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,3.0,"I was a bit skeptical before taking this class, but I really enjoyed it. It actually became my favorite class because it challenged me to see things differently. I would recommend him to anyone wanting to take philosophy."
9624,753047,Mark,Reed,Tarrant County College (all),Philosophy,PHIL1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Reed really makes you question your thinking while being a great teacher. He offers extra credit and his tests are exactly like the study guide, so getting an A is easy if you try. If you miss a class it's okay, but he likes if you participate in class discussions. Go to his office hours if you are struggling, he will try to help you."
9626,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,3.0,"I thought I was not going to move forward with my nursing due to me having a hard time with Biology. I am so glad I gave Biology another go because Dr. O explains things in increments and goes into detail. He wants his students to understand the material, always responds to emails, and loves what he does. Best Biology professor in my book!"
9627,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,4.0,"He is probably the best professor I have ever had. He gives examples to make understanding something easier, he makes these funny little jokes during his screencast. I have not finished the class yet, but if I somehow fail, that would be all on me. He makes a hard class seem less miserable. BEST PROFESSOR!!!!"
9628,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,1.0,4.0,"O'connell was very unclear about what you needed to know in lab, and put the work entirely on the students with no direction. He would say things weren't important, or not cover them at all, and then put them on the test or quiz. He wasn't so bad in lecture as long as you studied all your notes, but his test questions were extremely vague."
9629,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"I loved Dr OConnells A&amp;P class! Its definitely tough, you have to show up and study, but he gives you every opportunity to succeed if you put forth the slightest effort. He is entertaining and makes lectures fun. If you are struggling with something, just ask and he will help you make sense of it. By far my favorite professor!"
9630,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AANDPII,5.0,3.0,Good professor . You just have to make sure to study the material or you will fail the quizzes. And the exams are basically the quizzes put together which is super easy
9631,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIL2402,5.0,3.0,Dan is a great professor. He understands what everyone's going through and he encourages you when the class starts getting tough. Make sure you take extensive notes and ask questions when you're confused. In lab make sure you video the dissections and take pictures of the models
9632,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,3.0,Dr OConnell is a great teacher. But you have to put in the work in order to do well. He goes over everything that will be on the test in his lectures but very rarely will he actually say what will be on the test. No power points and no reviews. Record him and take detailed notes. If you are confused just ask and he will clarify.
9633,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,3.0,"Dr. O, is a great professor, makes you understand A&amp;P. However, there are no power-points, your notes is what is key, so make sure you don't slack off. You are able to record his lectures which I strongly recommend and take great notes. Took him for A&amp; P I and II and got an A for both! If you put in the work, your will be able to pass."
9634,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Oconnell is by far my favorite professor Ive had. Yes, I got a D, but that was completely on me, I didnt devout much of my time to studying. Hes hilarious. Answers questions well. NOTES ARE IMPORTANT!!! HE DOESNT USE POWERPOINTS! But hes still 10/10"
9635,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1407,5.0,4.0,Bio is a hard subject. Took him for summer &amp; he made Bio my new fav subject. He was funny &amp; lectures were always amazing. I never wanted to fall asleep. Im passionate about my choice in career because of him. Will take him again for A&amp;P. You have to buckle down &amp; study for exams. Take notes &amp; pay attention. Lab was fun too &amp; do-able.
9636,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,"By FAR the BEST TEACHER! No powerpoints, so yes, you will need to attend class and take notes! Best Advice, record him on top of taking your notes. Helps alot! Also make sure you participate and ask questions if you don't understand. He is very helpful in relating his stories or examples for you to better understand a subject."
9637,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,"O'Connell is one of the best profs I've ever had. His lectures are straight to the point, he's the most consistent teacher I've ever had when it comes to tests. It helps to record him because he doesn't always write everything he says on the board. He's charming, funny, and always has a random but good story to tell about himself. Highly recommend!"
9638,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,He is the best professor I've had. His lectures are entertaining and funny. He also makes the very abstract world of A&amp;P a lot more relatable with his explanations.
9639,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,3.0,"Professor O'Connell is literally the perfect teacher -- gives informative lectures (no lame powerpoints), always has a positive attitude, engages with the class constantly, and has pretty okay jokes. The class itself makes you know a lot of info, but he always give everything you need for tests and quizzes. As long as you study, it's an easy A."
9640,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,3.0,"Not sure why this professor doesn't have a 4.9 rating. He is an amazing lecturer and makes learning actually really fun. The only thing I would say is to just ask a lot of questions in lab because he is kind of hands off and wants people to take control of their own learning, but he is always available to help."
9641,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1407,5.0,3.0,"Took him for summer &amp; he was so fun! Prob the best bio professor I've had, learnt a lot. Connects well with students, we had a small class which was even better. You have to put some effort in as its a Bio Majors class but as long as you put the time to study &amp; SHOW UP, you'll pass. He's nice &amp; will work with you. Taking him again for A&amp;P"
9642,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,4.0,He's very knowledgeable and hilarious. He is willing to help if you need it! I got a B and I put in 75% effort. He gives you a lot of outside study materials. Tests and quizzes are hard if you don't study. I am taking him again for A &amp; P 2. I recomend him if you're a visual learner.
9643,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,3.0,"Best professor I've ever had. Absolutely hilarious. Every class was enjoyable and his expectations are very clear. He's really understanding, and cares about his students. A&amp;P sucks, but his class makes it worth it! Take him!"
9644,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,5.0,He is a good human being and I liked his lectures ( no powerpoints just fyi). The hard part was knowing whats going to be tested on since there are no reviews extra credit or curves :( he did however make class enjoyable but test were short with 40ish multiple choice then around 6 short answers Quizzes nothing like the test sadly different wording
9645,1001786,Daniel,O'Connell,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,4.0,"O'Connell is an amazing professor! You do need to show to class and be prepared to take notes, no power points, and all tests except for the final have short answer questions. Book is beneficial to supplement some topics from his lectures. Sometimes would get off topic during lecture but I found him to be quite funny! Take him!"
9647,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,1.0,Took this class online . with working 9 til 5 and one online course you may want to reconsider. He has no exceptions. This is not an easy A. He is clear on grading but if you fail you fail no make up work no extra credit. 3 major exams strictly from the book. Also 10+ reading assignment you must read or you will not pass trust me. 1 writing essay.
9648,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,3.0,4.0,To do well in this class you have to read from the textbook which take up a lot of time. Your major grades are 3 tests and an oral presentation. Not an easy class.
9649,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"great guy and great teacher. funny, engaging, understanding, and makes you want to come to class"
9650,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"Honestly a really great professor, his tests are a lot of material but he explains everything well and is really passionate about the class. He also would give side knowledge about the topics in class. A freaking M A N!"
9651,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors Ive ever had! Very understanding, basically saved my life when I got my dates confused about my final exam &amp; let me make it up. (even though giving me a 10 point penalty). I took him for summer II online, do not regret it one bit!"
9652,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"The perfect professor, passionate about what he teaches and makes it interesting. Took him for both courses that he has for American history. Totally hot, too, in that daddy way. Surprised I could focus."
9653,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hacker was great! Make sure to keep up with the online quizzes and you'll do fine. Tests aren't too hard and instead of essays, he gives short answer questions. Occasionally he'll give out a pop quiz but they only counted as extra credit. You have you go to his office to see the specific results of your exams. Make sure to read the book."
9654,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"THE FUNNIEST MAN EVER!! He makes 80 minutes of class feel like 5 minutes. I never look at the time because it goes by so fast. He's very funny, yet content in what he teaches. His lectures are very helpful and easy to understand. He will always help if you need it, whenever."
9655,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,Hacker is a wonderful professor. He lectures 24/7 but makes it fun and relatable. I recommend taking his class. Do all your reading quizzes and study hard before exams. 10/10 reccomend
9656,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Very clear grading criteria. Prof. Hacker has fantastic lectures! You will leave this class with a love for history. Take his class, you will not regret it!"
9657,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST13012,5.0,4.0,"Fantastic professor, all his lectures are interesting. His exams are based on them so don't miss any classes. I had him for 1301 and he gives one major research paper; the guidelines are very clear, I made a 100. He asks you to buy the textbook but I didn't use it all, everything you need to know is in the lectures. I highly recommend taking him."
9658,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"Professor Hacker is easily one of the best professors I've ever had. His lectures are interesting and actually make you want to learn. He has a point based grading system. He has a reading quiz every week on blackboard, they are easy 10 points. His exams are based on his lectures, so don't skip class!! If you are a good student, you will get an A."
9659,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"I took Mr. Hacker for the second half of History and absolutely loved it. I am actually taking him again right now for the first part of History. He is very funny, and makes History enjoyable to listen to. Staying on top of your assignments is important, as he only gives 2 tests and the final. 10/10 recommend to those who do or do not love History!"
9660,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,I took Hacker for HIST1301 and had so much fun so I knew I had to take his HIST1302 class. I was not disappointed! Hacker is such a great speaker and makes the topics interesting. I didn't really need the textbook but it is CRUCIAL that you attend class since most of the questions on the test can be found from your lecture notes.
9661,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"A very funny teacher that convinced me to become a history major. As long as you pay attention in lecturers the test should be relatively easy, especially the final. Also don't forget about the reading quizzes!"
9662,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,He's very knowledgeable and can teach very well. He's also funny and makes learning history interesting.
9663,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"I took Professor Hacker for both HIST 1301 and 1302. He is the most amazing professor I have ever had in college. His lectures are all clear, he explains the material clearly and funny. You must come to class everyday and take notes of his lectures. Focus on the study term and read the book before exams, and you will get an easy A. Highly recommend"
9664,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,3.0,"Hacker is such a funny man. You can tell he's really passionate about history when he lectures. He makes jokes and makes the class laugh, so it's not just boring old blah blah blah about history. He answers questions thoroughly when you ask. He has pop quizzes, but they're 5 questions each and don't count against you. He wants to see you succeed."
9665,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"I love Professor Hacker and I wish he taught more classes. Make sure to always come to class and take good notes on his study terms, because if you do you'll easily make an A on his exams! He's very clear on how he grades- a few exams, easy online reading quizzes, and a paper. I highly recommend him for all your history classes!"
9666,231828,Peter,Hacker,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST2301,5.0,3.0,"My favorite professor! I took him for US History parts one and two, and for Texas History! I wish he taught more classes so I could take him again!  Hacker for Prez.!!!"
9668,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,This professor by far was the funniest and the most outgoing professor I have ever had because he was always in a good mood every day when he came to class which also made me enjoy his class much more than any other lecture classes. His discussion would make every topic interesting and funny in order for his students to learn.
9669,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,"His is unlike any others I have seen. He lectures, but he also shows examples and presents material in a way that is engaging and interesting. He is able to present it in such a way that we make connections very easily, and therefore, we are able to better learn the material. Overall, he has a good personality and"
9670,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,My absolute favorite class! He is funny and actually learned. He is passionate which made me more interested Definitely will take him again.
9671,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2314,5.0,4.0,Took his online class for a Maymester. Very structured and he was very quick to respond to emails. He had a calendar with all the due dates. He told us from the beginning we would need to cover an entire semester into a few days. It was work but worth it to get the class done!
9672,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2314,1.0,3.0,I took this professor for a maymester and never again. I had like 7 mental breakdowns in one week. His calendar for assignments was very unorganized and that is what made it tough for me. I kept missing assignments even though I i was on top of the assignments every single day.
9673,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2314,3.0,4.0,"I took his online class &amp; wish I would've taken him on campus considering all the good comments. You have to study hard to make a good grade. There is no slack cut here, you either apply yourself or you will NOT pass. I barely passed. This is one of the most intense classes I have taken so far online, but I did learn a lot."
9674,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,"His class is the only one I ever really looked forward to. Although the online transition was tough, he still tried his best to make his video lectures intriguing. His tests aren't too bad but still prep. in advance! his tests aren't the type you could study for the night before. I would take his class again if I could!!!"
9675,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,Funny and smart and really showed he cared when we went online. I miss the in person class!
9676,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2314,2.0,3.0,"I wouldn't recommend his online course. There's a hefty time limit to the tests and quizzes. You won't even get a minute a question. I ran out of time a few times and had reached out to him and I pretty much got ""too bad"" as my response."
9677,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,"Prof Robinson was very respectable and knew what he was talking about. He had interesting and interactive lectures that made you want to pay attention, even if you don't like psychology. Would definitely take another one of his classes. You have to show up and read the textbook if you want to be successful, though. Overall, good class."
9678,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,Professor Robinson makes expectations clear from the beginning of the course. He has amazing lectures. He makes psychology terms and concepts relevant to everyday life.
9679,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,Amazing! Somehow he can be funny and serious at the same time. Best class I have taken. Looked forward to going every day!
9680,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,Great teacher... lots of laughter in class.
9681,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,3.0,"Amazing and helpful. Go to class, listen and you will do fine! He is there for you if you have questions and wants you to succeed. I wish every professor was like him!"
9682,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,2.0,4.0,Robinson is a nice professor but the point grading is difficult to understand and there is no clear schedule that helps you be organized. There is at least one pop quiz every week and testing starts as soon as the second week.
9683,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2314,4.0,3.0,"Professor Robinson was extremely interactive, frequently uploading videos for us to watch. I felt like I had an endless supply of study material which was amazing. Very thorough and excellent teacher!"
9684,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,Amazing instructor! Keeps class engaged. Interact and allows students to have moments to share their thoughts. Keeps class laughing. I enjoyed being in his class. Clarifies anything that I may have a question about. Wish more instructors were more like him.
9685,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,"One of my Favorites! He makes the class interesting, if it wasnt for him I feel like I would have fallen asleep"
9686,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,Amazing! I actually learned and felt like I was in college.
9687,592670,Karl Des,Robinson,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,I LOVED HIM! He is funny and smart. The weekly quizzes weren't bad as they basically give you the answers. They are there to help you. The best class I have taken at TCC! I changed my major to Psychology because of his class!
9689,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOV2305,4.0,2.0,"Took Professor Murphy for GOV 2305 and actually enjoyed the class. Her lectures are really short and sweet, unlike other professors. At the end of the week, there's a quiz and it is based on the short lectures and she gives a review and optional helpful videos to study."
9690,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOVT1302,5.0,3.0,"She is sweet, kind, and makes her lectures enjoyable with her comedic personality. No textbook is required because she has notes on blackboard. All pop quizzes are in class but its always open notes. This course is also not homework heavy."
9691,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"This is one of the best Professors I've had so far, she is very clear and up front about everything to expect. Her syllabus clearly lines out your time with her. If you can't walk away, your not trying. She focuses on our surroundings and if nothing you will walk away with the knowledge of whats going on in Texas. Highly recommended, very positive"
9692,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOV2306,5.0,2.0,This professor is amazing and sweet! She truly cares about all her students. Tests and quizess are really simple because lectures are posted on blackboard
9693,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"Professor Murphy is the best, so don't hesitate in taking her class. Quizzes and exams just study and you will do fine she provides a review sheet so you know what you really need to focus on. A few assignments, fairly easy. No textbook required she provides the notes. I recommend printing out lecture notes because her spoken details matter!!!"
9694,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOVT2306,5.0,1.0,"I love her!! She's such a great teacher, I don't like politics but she has gotten me interested in this subject much more! :)"
9695,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,Makes learning about government easy and fun
9696,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOV2306,5.0,2.0,alright so here's the tea. TAKE HER. BEST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD. I was honestly sad I had already taken federal gov or I would have taken all my history with her. she's literally a comedian she was my first morning class and I never missed. TCC is blessed to have her. PAY HER MORE ( if tcc reads this) she deserves it.
9697,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,FEDGOVT2305,5.0,1.0,I love Mrs. Murphy she is one of the the few teachers who ACTUALLY cares and want to see you pass. What she talks about in class is actually something useful that you will use outside of class. She is very well respected and one of the realist teachers I know. Theres no way you will fail her class unless you absolutely do nothing.
9698,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOV1301,5.0,2.0,Mrs Murphy is well educated and amazing! Tests were based off of class lecture and powerpoints. I reccomend taking her. She also has a great sense of humor.
9699,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,"Amazing experience! She will educate you, make you laugh, and inspire you! Loved her class, I would take it again a million times."
9700,891604,Marilyn,Murphy,Tarrant County College (all),Political Science,GOV2302,5.0,2.0,"Don't skip class. Take notes. Great instructor. You have to know the material for the tests but she can get caught up answering student questions which means self-teaching some material. She's more than happy to answer questions and is a great teacher. It's a political science class, but try to avoid talking politics -- she'll make you look dumb."

9711,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,I am not even finished with taking this course but I absolutely love Professor Riley. She is very personable and light.

As well Professor Riley is very understanding!

She sometimes had us doing class work that seemed pointless or discussions that just really werent helpful. She almost babied us as well.  One second you think on track youre doing great, the next your hopelessly confused and everything is everywhere."
9717,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,3.0,2.0,"EASY. 3 essays: Defintion, Rhetorical, final on syllabus. Short readings, potential quiz. Service project; good idea, poor introduction. Doesn't provide important details or enough time to plan. Harsh essay grader; irritated if you ask her to elaborate. Passionate + cares but few unruly peers made her rude to all. Was an unpleasant environment."
9718,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,COMP1301,5.0,2.0,Professor Riley is always willing to work with you. She is easy to communicate over email and easy to reach her in her office. She is caring and understands what it feels like to be a student and have a job and life outside of class.

9719,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,COMP1301,1.0,4.0,"I won't ever take her again that being said. She is a VERY tough grader, I got my paper proof read by the writing center multiple times but the paper was still below her standards. She is very inflexible with students who can't make it to every class. Plus if you don't have time to just worry about her class ... I don't suggest."
9720,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,1.0,"She is an amazing teacher!!!!! She has brought food to class multiple times and really cares about her students. Show up on time, be respectful, and stay awake then you will pass."

Keep up with the given reading assignments and ask questions. If you put the effort in, it's an easy A!! Keep your phone on silent that way if you need to take a call you can. She's understanding if you talk to her beforehand. Lots of moms and wives so communication is key with Ms. Riley"
9722,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,Ms. Riley is an excellent professor if you want to improve your writing. She's really strict about attendance and will throw more daily assignments in when she sees that attendance is low - there are SO many daily classwork grades. Her material is very interesting though - we analyzed Tupac for a poetry assignment.
9723,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,EGNL1302,5.0,2.0,"Hey honestly, it was a lot of reading for the first half, then it got easier. she is a very good teacher and encourages you to express your opinion and she will give you feedback. I was never bored, I took this for maymester- so that's why it was kind of a lot the first week. I would take her again if I could. The website making is the best part!"
9724,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,4.0,4.0,show up and pay attention. In my opinion if you're on your phone or doing some other class work that Is rude and she will call you out on it. sit through your lecture and do Hw and you pass. You get what you put into it.
9725,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,1301AND1302,5.0,1.0,"I have had her two times now and enjoyed her class a lot. She always gives the semester a theme so you are not just doing pointless work, it always relates to a theme. In my composition one class the theme was failing forwards and composition two was about Disney movies. She is very caring and wants you to succeed. Very easy to make an A."
9726,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,1301AND1302,5.0,4.0,Professor Riley is absolutely incredible. I took 1301 in class &amp; couldn't have asked for a better professor. I took her 1302 class online not knowing if I would drop or not because I was extremely pregnant &amp; due that semester. I received an A+ in both classes while writing essays with a newborn on my chest &amp; no sleep. If you dream it you can do it.
9727,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL1301,5.0,1.0,"Took her over the spring term, she is very nice and tries to help you succeed. She choses a theme to use throughout the semester that makes things really fun and interesting. Grades easy on papers if you use the correct format and answer the prompt you'll do great. A little of short reading passages and easy quizzes if you read. Would take again!!!"
9728,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,COMP1301,2.0,3.0,"Professor Riley was an alright teacher. Her instructions on assignments weren't always clear. However, they weren't the worst, only a few short response essays and 3 major essays that were actually fun to write about. She's really strict on phones and will call you out for them in front of the entire class"
9729,351319,Shewanda,Riley,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,4.0,3.0,Professor Riley is very upbeat and enthusiastic about the material she teaches and her classes are always interesting.

Her glaring flaw is that she is extremely strict about students not using phones(or even laptops for the most part) during class.
9731,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG2328,4.0,4.0,"I took Ms. Adams online class for Summer 2020. All the course work was available a week early and that gave me a great advantage since I work. There is a lot of reading, journals, videos, quizzes, and discussion board. If you take the opportunity that Ms. McAdam gives for the quizzes and the extra credit, you will do great in the class."
9732,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG2328,5.0,4.0,"I took this class online for Wintermester- she requires you to buy a book online which will be used the entire class.

WORK FOR IT AND THIS CLASS IN AN EASY A!"
9733,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL1301,5.0,2.0,"Does not require a textbook but is big on ATTENDANCE. There are only 3 essay papers throughout the semester.

Offers up to 200 points of extra credit at the end of the semester which boosted me from a B to an A. This class is super easy and is a great GPA booster. You need textbooks to complete everything in this class."
9736,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL2327,5.0,3.0,"Dr. McAdams clearly sets out the expectations and due dates for everything at the beginning of the course. She gives you access to all of the material and an amazing extra credit opportunity from day 1, which would open later in the semester. This allows the student to go at their own pace, which is amazing! The book is required! Amazing instructor"
9737,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL2327,5.0,1.0,I took American Literature I with Dr. McAdams. She uploaded all her coursework before class even started.

9741,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG2327,5.0,3.0,"I took this class during the summer online class. Prof opens entire course so you can work ahead. Extra credit allowed me to push for an A. Clearly lays out point system to know your grade so if you already have an A, you don't have to take the final. I would take again."
9742,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,2.0,"Great professor. Her class isnt a typical English class where youre gonna read books NO ! show up to class and do the work and you will definitely pass. Also, she likes to garden so you will have to garden and if you dont than I prefer you to drop. You do have 1 research paper for the final and she does give the opportunity for extra credit."
9743,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG2328,4.0,2.0,"Professor McAdams is an awesome teacher. She gives tons of quizzes but no tests till the final, all of the answers are from the quizzes. Discussion posts are an easy A, just do it.

9746,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL2327,5.0,2.0,This class was really good. All the work is open at the beginning with the exception of the final. She is available to help and gives good feedback. The schedule of all assignment due dates are given ahead of time as well and they lock at on those dates. The only way to fail is missing assignments
9747,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG2327,4.0,3.0,"I liked that the whole class was opened from the very beginning. The video quizzes were annoying but overall the class was good. Her schedule was odd as it was spread out on random days so make sure you keep track of due dates! If you have an A, you don't have to take the final."
9748,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL2327,5.0,2.0,"so many quizzes with 15 minutes to do but 2 tries, 4 'journals' &amp; 4 discussion boards. There are deadlines but she said you can have it all done the first week if needed. Loved this class. Loved the stories &amp; McAdams really loves this subject. Super easy. But if you have over 1600 points then no final. Answers questions quickly. must have book."
9749,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,4.0,4.0,Good teacher. DON'T BE LATE!! She thinks out of the box and is FUN! She is tough but she teaches you everything she wants you to know.
9750,757244,Ruth,McAdams,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,3.0,"She has a super extreme tardy policy, with a 1 minute grace period, so if youre 2 minutes late dont expect to get any participation points or credit for any assignments due that day."
9752,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1409,5.0,3.0,Professor Huse is an awesome professor. I underestimated her lectures during a summer class(I didn't have too much time due to work). Definitely need to listen to her lectures word for word and take notes because if you dont you will not make it. Her class is not hard its actually easy. Just make sure you have the time to do the work.
9753,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1407,5.0,4.0,Great professor and this is why I took her for Bio 1406 and Bio 1407.
9754,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,4.0,I wish Ms. Huse taught more Bio classes. She is awesome and easy to approach if you are struggling. Her lectures are reflected directly to how her exams will be like. It is important to attend the study groups in the SLC as this can be really helpful. I would take her class again and wish she taught other bio classes.
9755,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1406,5.0,4.0,"I took this class expecting the worst outcome, however, ended semester with a B+. She is very passionate and has a good sense of humor. Prof. Huse always finds relatable ways to explain the information. I don't think I ever used my textbook but I did take very good notes! Subject is a handful but if you study, you will do great!"
9756,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO14061407,5.0,3.0,"Took her for both biology 1406 and 1407, and she is one of the best professors I've ever had at TCC.

9757,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1406,5.0,4.0,She is a 10/10 professor.

9758,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1406,5.0,2.0,"If you're into Biology, her lessons WILL NOT BORE YOU. She's the best professor I've ever had on this campus so far. Clear &amp; easy to understand, and BE SURE TO WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING IN CLASS. 3 Unexcused absences will not give you the ability to drop one of your lowest test grades."
9759,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,"Huse was a great professor, her lectures are easy to follow if you listen and take notes. there are 4 exams but you can drop one as long as you don't miss more than 3 days in the semester. her tests are just like the lectures as well as the lab practical. Definitely recommend taking her"
9760,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1407,5.0,2.0,"I took professor Huse again for Bio II and I'm still impressed by how well she can maintain attention and keep her lectures so interesting. Make sure you study lecture notes very well for exams. Honestly, I wish she taught other branches of science so I can take her again and again. I would recommend everyone to take her class!"
9761,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1407,5.0,3.0,"Absolutely LOVED her! She really knows what shes teaching and you can tell shes passionate about it.

9762,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1407,5.0,5.0,"The lectures are great, the material given in class matches the test but you must listen with great notes. She make her expectation known and if followed all will be well. Attendance is critical and helpful to great success. There is an SI attached to the class which will push you harder to study the material. Great teacher for health career."
9763,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO14061407,5.0,3.0,"I absolutely love professor Huse! She's fantastic. I've taken her for twice and plan on taking her for a 3rd time in the summer.

9766,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1406,4.0,4.0,"One of the tougher classes i've took, however you walk away with a lot of knowledge. I would recommend studying 2 weeks in advance. Take good notes, record, and study EVERYTHING. I had her for lecture only and javlilvand for lab (dynamic duo, highly recommend). Test are super tricky but an A is still achievable. 3 test, 1 final (can be dropped)."
9767,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1406,5.0,3.0,"Im not sure what class the last reviewer was in. I also took her this semester and she was great. Not a high school teacher. Tough, yes. Lots of material, yes. I want to go to med school so I need to know this stuff. Anyone who didnt pass just wasnt working enough."
9768,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1409,4.0,3.0,"Mrs. Huse is an amazing professor. The stories she told in class were my favorite thing out of the class, really made it fun. There's 3 tests including the final but you can be excluded from it if you are passing with a C. The tests are exactly as the notes STUDY YOUR NOTES. Lab is harder than lecture-heads up. Good luck."
9769,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1409,5.0,4.0,"She has a great personality and tells jokes that relate to the material, keeping things fun and entertaining. There is a lot of material, but her tests relate directly to the notes, so if you write everything she has on her PowerPoints and study that, you'll make great grades on your tests. She is a great Professor, and I'll really miss her."
9770,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,2.0,"In her lectures, she makes sure to go in depth with the important things and not focus on the negligible. If you have trouble understanding, she's willing to go through the material over again to make sure you get it. Very nice lectures, especially if you have a natural interest in biology - she keeps your attention well. Study well  easy exams."
9771,337881,Regina,Huse,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1409,5.0,3.0,"Amazing Professor. She has such a great sense of humor, and covers everything on the test with her lectures. If you study the notes, you'll do very well. It's biology, so it's a lot of things you most likely won't know (words like Deuteromycota or Diatoms), but if you study a few days before exams, you'll be fine. She makes learning enjoyable."
9773,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,1.0,4.0,"His reviews and homework have nothing to do with what is going to be on the test, so doing the review seems like it doesn't even matter. I would recommend looking for a different teacher."
9774,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH2414,5.0,3.0,"I took professor Disu for Calculus II. Homework is easy because of MML providing examples and multiple tries. Tests are more difficult, but reviews are provided and if you take the time to review past homework and practice the review they're definitely doable. I enjoyed class discussions and bringing in homework questions to work through together."
9775,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,1.0,1.0,"By far the worst professor. Major language barrier, which is fine, except he refuses to accept that and argues with everyone when they say he's made serious mistakes. He sends hundreds of emails with incorrect info, then argues with you for informing him on his error. Avoid this prof. at all costs. Even the assistant didn't know what he was doing."
9776,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,1.0,5.0,"If this professor is the only one available, do not take him. I took him online after seeing his score on this website and thought it couldn't be that bad. I was wrong, instructions for tests are unclear and he will never answer your emails or phone call. I could not go visit him during his office hours because of COVID-19. Do not take him online."
9777,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,3.0,3.0,This was an online class. It wasn't bad until I procrastinated. He expects you to read the textbook and his notes. SAVE HIS NOTES he deletes them. He has a brief explanation for each chapter and discussion boards in the beginning of the semester. There is a lot of hw on pearson mylab. I suggest study everything for the test not just the review
9778,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,STAT1342,2.0,4.0,"Took the online stats course, it seemed difficult. He is hard to get an email back from, some students were emailing each other with questions. He removed the syllabus during the first part of the semester, so make sure you save it. Tests are harder than the review, and some of the stuff on the reviews wasn't even accurate. Drops lowest test."
9779,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,3.0,5.0,"Was he the hardest professor I've ever had? Yes. Were his tests not like the reviews, sometimes. But he tells you up front, if you do the work and TRY he will work with you. When my class switched to online because of covid, I was the only student who attended his video chats. He told me that showing up helps my grade."
9780,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"Professor Disu gives his students everything they need to be successful in such a notoriously tough class. He uses MyMathLab for homework, assigns a few short assignments, 4 total tests, and posts super helpful handouts for each section that explains concepts and instructions to use the ti 84 calculator- huge help! He is AWESOME!"
9781,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,4.0,This is one of the worst instructors I have ever had. Mr. Disu showed up to class late almost every day. Sometimes 30 minutes late. Lectures were often about the wrong subject or just incorrect. He did not care about assignments as there were lots of problems he never cared to adress. Sent emails at 2 AM asking us to meet at 8:30 AM that day. Awful
9782,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,2.0,4.0,"Mr. Disu seems like a good guy, but I don't think he is a good teacher. He did okay at explaining stuff, but when it came to tests they were NOTHING like homework or reviews. He gives out a lot of homework too. He makes a lot of mistakes when doing problems on the board as well. He may be a good guy, but he is definitely not a teacher I recommend."
9783,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1301,5.0,3.0,"This guy is perfectly reasonable, he emphasizes the right things and had a simple structure to his class."
9784,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,1.0,5.0,took his online class if you take it make sure you save or write down all the notes he deletes them as soon as the assignment is due . definitely DO NOT recommend his class unless its your last choice as he doesnt respond to emails often and if he makes a mistake he doesnt fix it for the whole class as well as he doesnt post notes or book pages.
9785,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,2.0,3.0,He isn't very clear on his math and what he is doing. He doesn't like being asked questions until after class. And the tests are NOTHING like the test review. I recommend taking another teacher is available but if hes your last option it isn't the end of the world.
9786,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,2.0,"First of all, I dont why there is such a low review about Mr. disu. He is one of the finest professor at Northeast. I took him online for statistics on summer. Being honest here, he assign lot of assignments to do. But, yeah we are in college. He drop the lowest exam grade with your homework assignment. Do not have second thought. Just take it."
9787,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,5.0,Professor Disu was great. I took him for statistics maymester. It was extremely hard because it was a 10 day class. He was good at working problems out and explaining the problems. He made sure you understand it. I didnt do so well but he was a good instructor and I would take him again for another math class as hes very knowledgeable.
9788,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH2318,1.0,4.0,"He is a tough grader and he makes so many mistakes on the board but he doesn't want you to do the same in the exam. Please learn to memorize and paraphrase the theories in the exams others you're doomed to get and big F. I took in for linear algebra and in my entire math series, I have never met such a teacher who is full of mistakes."
9789,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH2415,4.0,3.0,He is good. Can be strict. He is caring . He loves to impact his knowledge.
9790,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH2414,1.0,4.0,"He is not organized at all. He is obviously not prepared for his lecture. Makes too much mistakes every day, and he does not clear the confusion. He just writes the book down on the boards, and cannot understand and answer student's question. His lecture is a mess, and he expects high difficulty in the test."
9791,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH2414,4.0,4.0,I took him for Calc-II this spring. I was well know about him since first. If you are a mathematics major then I recommend to take him because his tests are challenging and it's fun to do it. He is always ready to help.
9792,1220727,Olamiju,Disu,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,2.0,3.0,"I have never been very well at math, so professor Diju was good at ""dumbing"" things down when it came to it, but it all reality some of his ""lectures"" were videos that we would watch for the entire hour and a half. There were also several times where us, the students, would correct his math. He also burps a lot under his breath while lecturing."
9794,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1311,4.0,2.0,Professor Brown does a great job of breaking down concepts and making students feel comfortable with the material. He also creates interesting projects that add to the class as well as giving out reviews for exams. He makes every student feel comfortable with speaking in public. Highly recommend him as long as you don't mind putting in some effort.
9795,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,2.0,"I was skeptical to take public speaking online, but he really made an effort to teach &amp; improve our speaking skills. He's very nice &amp; truly cares for his students. He gives all of your work for the week each Monday and it's due by Sunday at 10pm, so you can work at your own pace. It's a lot of work, but doable &amp; you can easily make an A if you try."
9796,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,Professor Brown was so sweet! I took him online for the Maymester course. It was a ton ton ton of work because it was in two weeks so it was understandable. He truly cares about his students and replies to emails very quickly. Super easy class if you do all of the assignments. 4 test and he drops your lowest one. Test are easy as well.
9797,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,1.0,"He's a good teacher, but sometimes he kinda babies you and treats you like you're in elementary school. There aren't really a lot of assignments, just in class participation and the speeches. He tells you whatever you need to work on to get a better grade for the next speech. Super easy class though."
9798,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1301,5.0,2.0,Professor Brown is a brilliant and hilarious lecturer. He truly cares about his students and the discipline of speech. All expectations and rules for each assignment are clearly stated. He makes sure you understand how to do each speech and he really helps you get out of your shell. Highly recommended.
9799,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,1.0,"Professor Brown was great at creating a classroom environment that would help calm your nerves, or made it so that you wouldn't be too worried about messing up on a speech. It might be awkward at first, but just break the ice and get to know your classmates and the professor. Express yourself in your speeches and learn to control your nerves!"
9800,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,2.0,"Love, love, loved him. A great professor and person all around. If you're not good at speaking he really helps calm your nerves. He helps people get that grade they deserve even if they don't speak as much as other people, he works with you on that. He's very caring and hilarious and you wouldn't regret taking his class :)"
9801,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,4.0,"He is awesome and Hilarious. Is an easy class to pass, come to class , do all assignments and you will be good. Amazing Professor!!!"
9802,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,3.0,1.0,"Professor Brown is super extra and annoying but his class is easy. He dosent grade harsh. You have to do 4 speeches throughout the semester. He is very kind! Attendance isn't mandatory but he takes daily grades. So if you wanna get an A, make sure you show up every class!"
9803,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,1.0,"GREAT TEACHER!! Attendance is not mandatory he will not drop you, but you do have a lot of daily grades. Not a heavy grader and Mr. Brown is a hilarious teacher. I would take his class again for sure."
9804,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,"If you do not want to enjoy a class with a funny, hilarious professor.. Brown is not for you. He is not a tough grader as long as he sees that you are trying your hardest he will give you a decent grade .I see why people might get annoyed of him because he does talk a bunch but at least i got used to it. his lectures are smooth and easy to learn"
9805,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1301,1.0,4.0,"Don't get me wrong, he's funny and the class is enjoyable, but I do regret taking his course. All other speech professors were waaayy easier. His requirements for the speeches were unnecessary and he's super strict on how he grades them."
9806,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,4.0,"So with Brown, he's a really good teacher but he's so extra!! Like he treats us like 5 year olds. He doesn't let us use the restroom! but other than that he's a good teacher.. a lot of work needs to be done BUT its easy work!! most of the time I did it the night before its due! A lot of assignments and Presentations but like I said its really easy!"
9807,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,2.0,"very sweet, caring, and funny guy! will get you out of your comfort zone for the better! Doesn't mind if you email him 25/8! total 10/10... this class will make you love life"
9808,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1315,5.0,3.0,Mr. Brown is my life saver. He is the best professor I've ever had he is real. he will tell you exactly what he means. hes funny and even on my worst days he still finds ways to make me laugh i love him and recommend to all!!!
9809,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1301,5.0,2.0,Hilarious. Clear guidelines.  He wants you to do well. Definitely would take him again.
9810,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"One of the best Professors to date. He takes a very anxiety inducing class(Public Speaking) and relates it to you as an individual, assisted with plenty of comedy and great constructive feedback. I really wish there were more Professors with his mindset."
9811,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1311,5.0,1.0,"I took him in summer 1 of 2018 and he has by far been my favorite professor. He is hilarious and cares so much about his students. If you have to take speech this is the professor you want. He does make you wear your grown up pants though, if you don't show up for a speech he automatically takes points off. He's understanding if you just reach out."
9812,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,SPCH1305,5.0,1.0,"Professor Brown is seriously the best professor I have ever had. Not only does he give you numerous opportunities to be successful, but he actually genuinely cares about his students and is hilarious. I actually looked forward to his class everyday for maymester. Take his class! You will not regret it!"
9813,679803,Stephen,Brown,Tarrant County College (all),Communication,COMM1,5.0,2.0,"Awesome teacher! Met some good friends in this class. Only class I've taken so far that I can honestly say I enjoyed all of it. He's a bit strict when it comes to leaving the room, but other than that he's great."
9815,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,"(Before Covid) This was the best class I'll ever have the honor of taking and I'm so thankful. I went into her class with 0 writing experience, came out with a B (comp 1) and an A for comp2. Do your work, ask questions, and you'll succeed. Professor Davis not only helped my writing skills, but saved my confidence. Don't take if you want an easy A!"
9816,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,2.0,I never liked reading/writing but she really really helped me improve my writing. She encourages you to pick topics that matter to you which made the research a whole lot more interesting. She helps you whenever you need it but expects you to do your work. She's kooky and sarcastic AF which I love but may not be everyones cup of tea.
9817,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGL1302,5.0,3.0,"Especially during the COVID mess, Mrs. Davis went above and beyond to show she cared about us not just as students but as humans. She is kind and thoughtful and cares about what she teaches too. I think both extremes are hard to do in her class, to make an A or an F. She does her best to keep everyone on track who is trying. I'm grateful to her."
9818,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,i'm so grateful for what i learned from her. she really cares about her students and her subject. if you ask for writing help she always gives it to you. you have to keep up with reading assignments. she gives quizzes on the reading. but its easy if you just do what you're suppose to. she's really funny too which makes it easy to stay interested.
9819,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,COMP2,1.0,5.0,Just all out rude and disrespectful.
9820,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,She will challenge your writing skills only for the better. There are 3 papers total and she dont cut corners with grading. she will make you work hard only if you want it. She is the best engl professor ever. I have learned and grown in pro davis class(both times) love her attitude and spunkyness . Makes learning fun &amp; worth it Will help you also
9821,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,"It was my last class at TCC. After working so hard on best of my ability, i was ended up with 'B' grade. My GPA went down to 3.95 from 4.0 , i have 'A' grade on my all other classes and she is the reason behind falling my overall GPA. She is harsh grader. Won't recommend at all!"
9822,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,3.0,"one exam, 4 essays (first one is only two paragrphs, longest one is 3 pages). shes clear on what she wants on the essays and is helpful in office hours. i'm taking her again for comp 2."

9824,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,"Made class enjoyable, tough but honest grader,gives feedback, wants students to learn and get good grades."
9825,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,4.0,"3 essays, 2 tests, about 10 daily grades. Great lectures, encourages deep thought and conversation. Very structured and expects people to not only do the work but think critically and follow directions. Not a blowoff class. In my opinion she is intelligent and hilariously witty. I loved going to her classes. FYI I hate writing essays with a passion"
9826,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,4.0,Harsh grader. Wanting to pass with good grades to get into uni? Don't take this class. You will work day and night and she will still give you 50 and 60's after looking over your essay and saying she likes it. Does not give any in class work either. Do not take her class.
9827,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"This is a class i would not recommend to anyone i know. she does NOTHING but essays in there with little to no in-class work to pick up bad grades. I have done everything i can and have gone to the writing center there multiple times yet i still got 50s and 60s, even going to her office hours yet still no results. just don't take her class."
9828,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,5.0,3.0,"Professor Davis is easily among my all-time favorite teachers. I loved the class.

9831,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENGLI1302,5.0,4.0,"I absolutely adore this professor. Shes hilarious and you can tell she cares about what she does. Shes hard, but fair. Gives great feedback and wants student participation in class. She walks you through exactly how she wants the essays. I was bummed there werent any other classes I could take with her."
9832,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Davis is one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. She really cares about her class, she takes the time to learn everyone's names and she gives funny anecdotes. But heed this word of warning: only the worthy shall make it out alive. Good, hard-working students make good grades in this class, and lazy people or cheaters do not."
9833,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1301,1.0,5.0,"Tough grading on essay, you need to be a genius writer to get an A. Overall this is the hardest class ever."
9834,1077905,Lindsey,Davis,Tarrant County College (all),English,ENG1302,1.0,5.0,Just don't take her if you are a full time student and expecting for easy time with grade A. She cares about student and also loves her job. The way she grade paper is awful. I was barely able to satisfy her on essay. My GPA got down because of this class.
9836,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1411,5.0,3.0,"You need to be very prepared for class in order to make an A. There are quizzes every week,&amp; you need to stay on top of your work. You definitely do not want to fall behind in this class, there's a lot to cover! She creates videos to watch over each lesson; she's very dedicated &amp; cares about her class. Overall a great professor, I would take again"
9837,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1411,4.0,4.0,"When I first took Dr. Patrick, this was the second time that I took Gen Chem 1. She helped me understand the material much better than the first time I took it with a different professor. It is a lot of work, however, but as long as you invest the right amount of time and effort into it, you'll be alright."
9838,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1409,2.0,4.0,"This was by far the hardest class I have taken. Got an A in my calculus 2 class but this class was so much harder. I would studied over the things she would tell us to study and the tests would be different from what I studied. So if you're like me and you HAVE to take her, here are some tips: study over EVERYTHING. Especially the handouts."
9839,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1411,5.0,3.0,"Just know Chemistry 1411 is a lot of studies. I took her on my second attempt and passed with an easy B. You have to listen to the lecture, she will give all the instructions for tests. Her lab is very intellectual, so u will learn and do well for sure. Check her online resources that include her own lecture videos. U are sure to pass this class ."
9840,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM2311,5.0,5.0,By far the hardest class I ever took. Chem for engineering sounds hard. She tried to make it as easy as possible. I suck at chemistry but still managed to pass. :)

Since taking her class I now know how wonderfully she explained difficult topics. Her examples, practice problems, and guided notes are above and beyond her job obligations. You will not find a better chemistry professor"
9844,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1406,3.0,4.0,This was my first blended class so lecture mostly online a lab once a week on campus. She does review the lessons but its really up to you to understand it. she does give videos and powerpoints to help but i guess its just not my style. I prefer detailed explanation especially something like chemistry. Also she counts off for minute things.
9845,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1406,5.0,3.0,"She is extremely organized, communicates well with students, provides reasonable tests, timely, and polite. I took this class for a blended lecture. With that being said, there was a decent amount of homework.

I do not recommend taking this class with another science class its hard. She gives you all the stuff to succeed just go to class practice and get your free points by going to SI or tutoring lab."
9847,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1411,1.0,1.0,"She will hand hold you to an A. However, she often taught antiquated/wrong chem concepts irrelevant to someone who is trying to prepare for the future (MCAT, 4yr uni.). She needs to work on her professionalism, as her answer keys posted are always riddled with errors, she is quick to anger when asked to clarify concepts, and she is slow to grade."
9848,520151,Susan,Patrick,Tarrant County College (all),Chemistry,CHEM1411,1.0,4.0,"Dr. Patrick is lazy, she posts videos on Bb instead of actually teaching she treats her lecture class as an online course.

You should really take this class!!!"
9860,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,I love the lectures he has tons and tons of amazing stories of his experience as a psychologist. I would recommend people to take his classes because he tells you what you have in the test.
9861,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PHSYC2301,5.0,1.0,This class was AMAZING! He made sure to always keep the students involved and gave incredible speeches. You always walked out knowing something new. I highly recommend this class and him as the professor!
9862,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"I took this eight-week class, and it was my favorite. He made the class very fun, and his stories were unbelievably funny. It's a comfortable A/B if you do the papers assigned, and community service is required. If he taught another curriculum besides PSYC 2301, I would take it. The papers assigned were straightforward."
9863,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,SOCI1301,5.0,2.0,"By far the easiest class I've taken so far. I took him for the 8 week course online and only had 3 papers and 3 exams. He provides powerpoints to the book so you don't have to necessarily purchase it. He is a very fast grader, just follow his guidelines and be on top of the due dates and you'll get an easy A."
9864,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,Homework assignments were one page summaries of videos or articles. Three Chapter Test. Service Learning required. Does not accept late work. I enjoyed his lectures. He has real great stories and encourages class participation in the lecture discussion. A real kind and funny man. I would take another one of his classes if given the opportunity.
9865,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PHSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"He is my favorite teacher. He helps students get involved, and he really seems to care what students/you as an individual have to say. He is really funny, and it is a great and interesting class. It is actually pretty fun to participate, as he is encouraging. Just make sure you turn in your papers (they are easy) and your volunteer service. Study!"
9866,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC1301,5.0,2.0,"This professor was by far one of my favorites. I enjoyed his class, i looked foward to going. You do not have to buy the book, he has an option where you can download it. I took his 8 week course. A paper is due about every class. However, they are not difficult papers. There is a required service learning assignment (donate food)"
9867,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,You do not have to buy a book he understands the struggle life for college students. His work is super easy. You take interesting notes in class and he goes into detail about the powerpoint. He is a great professor really funny. His lectures are so interesting. All his test are online at home. I was super sad when the class ended.
9868,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,SOCI1301,5.0,1.0,I took this class over the summer very easy 3 papers and 3 exams. A+
9869,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC1301,5.0,2.0,"An easy A. He explains well, gives clear and interesting lectures, he's funny, gets to know all of his students! I would easily take his class again."
9870,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"3 words: Have Fun Reading! Well, you need to read the book, i was kind of lazy. The exams (3) are all open note and open book. and those are the only tests. ------He was entertaining and fun, pero now I'm done. mic drop I mean, I have an 87 right now, but I will probably get that 90, so i'm just going to put that A for good luck."
9871,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PHSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Menchaca is my favorite teacher! I always look forward to his class. He is hilarious, and Ive learned so much in a short period of time. You do have to read the book and take lots of notes for the tests (they arent the easiest)! We also have one page papers due every other class. I would definitely recommend taking his class!"
9872,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Such a good professor. He answers all questions and tells you what you should write down and is very good at helping you know what's important. About 13 papers and they're all 1 page and you get 10 points no matter if its a bad paper. 3 exams all online. So open book, note, and internet. Very easy to pass if you dont read and easy A if you do read."
9873,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,SOCI1301,5.0,3.0,"Took in the fall of 2018, like others have said there are 3 test and 3 essays. First essay is kind of long but the other 2 are super easy with great topics. Test are on quizlet and are not proctored. Easy A."
9874,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PHSYC2301,3.0,1.0,"I took his Sumer II on-line class. He is a very easy grader and may be the most lenient one I've had so far at Tarrant. His tests don't match the book, but there is time to google everything. It's an easy A. He won't answer any questions and he takes a week+ to grade assignments (in a four week class.) No point in reading book really, just google."
9875,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"By far my absolute favorite professor. His lectures are awesome; you won't believe some of his stories. Read the chapter before class so you can fully participate. He encourages discussion and is really trying to get you to think, ask questions and participate. Very kind, very caring. TAKE HIS CLASS, YOU WILL LOVE HIM. I call him ""Fun-chaca."""
9876,599031,Hector,Menchaca,Tarrant County College (all),Cultural Studies,PHSYC2301,4.0,2.0,"Very easy grader,No late work,Do the assignments the best you can and you get full credit, the assignments were easy to do as well,You do need the textbook and read the chapters, He replies emails in two days,The only thing that was confusing is that he doesn't go by chapters but by lessons so you need to see the lesson Title to know the chapter"
9878,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Gargan is an amazing professor! She truly cares about her students &amp; wants nothing but the best. She is really approachable &amp; is willing to answer your questions. This class was NOT easy but, you have h/w &amp; bonus points to help you boost your grade. Cannot stress it enough, attend SI &amp; read the textbook! If you do, you will get that A!"
9879,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,3.0,5.0,"Our lecture was dominated by 30 yr old moms who liked to hear themselves talk, therefore not covering a lot of material in class from wasted time talking. Homework backfired as a study guide, as we just wanted to get thru the copious amount &amp; not review it. Exams are hard &amp; blindside u. Loved her as a person but don't recommend. Lab book sucks."
9880,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,5.0,"I LOVE Gargan as a person as she is determined to get her students into programs, she knows her class is more valuable than a credit. However, it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get an A. She is seemingly disorganized, no powerpoints with words and gets off topic quickly. Exams are heavy essay portion and level 1-3 question MC. Dont recommend sadly :-/"
9881,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,5.0,So I will give her a fair review because I do not agree with people getting on the internet to bash people just because they are mad. I am very disappointed I chose to take her. She gives way too much homework. I didn't have time to focus on actually studying. I have a bachelors degree and I have never had this much trouble in a class.
9882,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,3.0,5.0,"Dr. Gargan is a very sweet, very passionate, and caring, but her class is hard. Most of the time I found myself having to teach myself even after lectures. There is a lot of homework that takes time away from your studying. I loved Dr. Gargan, but A&amp;p is already hard and everything that we were given just doesnt give you time to study."
9883,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,4.0,5.0,"Gargan is wonderful. She is extremely intelligent&amp; loves to teach A&amp;P2 BUT.. her class is very hard. She gives a lot of HW such as APRs which are 100 questions, WDYLs &amp; those are about 25+ questions with long answers &amp; requires you to read a lot, &amp; case maps which take hours to finish. If you dont mind learning independently, shes for you."
9884,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Gargan is a great teacher. She really cares about her students. There is a lot of homework and case studies to do but it really helps you learn the material. Dr. Gargan will always talk to you any time, she will answer your emails quick and will always make time for you to discuss concerns. She is one of the best teachers I have had!"
9885,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,4.0,"Love this class! Shes very clear on what to expect on her tests. Multiple choice, fill in the blank,&amp; drawings. Will help you understand and answer all questions you have. Very passionate about what she teaches. Ap2 is never easy with anyone you take but shes great! Lots of HW but its super helpful. As long as you communicate, youre golden."
9886,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP1,1.0,4.0,"The class is very hard and she will make you work for your grade. She sometimes loses track of your papers and puts in them in as zeros. She ultimately makes argue with her even when you completed the assignments, and turned them in on time. Gargan does not offer any reviews for her lecture, thus making the class extremely hard."
9887,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,4.0,4.0,"This class is NOT an easy A, but I also think how hard you have to work in this class adds to what you get out of it. Gargan talks very fast, so you need to show up every class and pay attention. I couldn't keep up with her so I would take notes ahead of time and highlight what she went over. Overall, difficult class with a passionate teacher"
9888,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"Quite simply, she loves what she does, and she want you to succeed. Time management is key. She looks for more of an understanding within her tests rather than just memorization. Study hard and talk to her, and you're bound to succeed."
9889,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP1,5.0,5.0,"I cannot give Dr. Gargan enough praise. She is an exceptional human being who has a passion for teaching, her students, &amp; a dedication to science. If I could have one professor throughout my nursing educational career, I would choose her in a heartbeat. She will teach you the obligatory material plus MUCH MORE to prepare you for whatever you need."
9890,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,4.0,4.0,Dr. Gargan is an amazing professor! She genuinely cares for her students and wants the best for them. Anatomy is not easy but she makes you love it!
9891,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,4.0,"I am a non-science major and took this class thinking anatomy was easy in high school-not paying attention to science major class. Although Dr. Gargan is amazing! A lot of hw and you NEED to study a lot to get a good grade. She is funny, caring and will answer ANY question you ask and make sure you understand. I managed with a C so focus and study!"
9892,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,5.0,"A&amp;P is a challenging class no matter who you take. Dr Gargan is entertaining, funny, smart (she helped write the lab book!) Clear about what is on the test, right down to what the essay will be and what the drawings are. Don't listen to neg reviews. There are so many resources to do well in this class. You have to put the time in to get the A."
9893,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,5.0,She really cares about students!! Also helps you out if you need more of an understanding! Great professor
9894,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,5.0,"Extremely tough class, but it was well worth it. Going into any health related career, you have to be ready to commit, and this class gives you a pretty good glimpse into how much you'll need to commit. I loved Dr. Gargan's class and I worked at it every day for the whole semester. She explains difficult concepts well and is very laid back. 11/10"
9895,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,4.0,"This class will not be for the weak. She is amazing though. This is only the beginning of hard, if you cannot handle her class you probably shouldn't be going into a medical field. Her class defiantly prepares you and you get what you put into this class. This is my second time takeing it and im honestly glad I choose her for this round!"
9896,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,5.0,"Tough class but she's kind &amp; funny! Passing/getting an A in her class is all about how much effort you put into studying the material she gives you - read, write, study, do her extra credit (it helps you study!) A&amp;P is just the beginning of challenging classes if you are getting a medical degree, so take Gargan b/c she will prepare you for that!"
9897,353684,Lynn,Gargan,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,1.0,5.0,"APII she will give you test with short essay and drawings, and multiple choice. The multiple choice is hard. You need to memorize the Drawings and explain what you draw. Last lecture exam is 20 multiple choice and the rest is written response on blank paper which she provides. Final is 200 multiple choice questions. Take someone else."
9899,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,Mr. John was so good and he is very good at details on solve problems. He willing help you if you are struggle then ask him!
9900,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,4.0,"One of the best Math Professors I've taken, I am horrible with math but am required to have this class with a B or better for my degree, make no mistake you will work for your grade, but he breaks it down to a level of understanding that is easy to remember."
9901,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"BEST math prof. He makes the material simple and bite-sized so you're NEVER overwhelmed, girl. Questions are answered with an understanding tone and usually a ""Math Joke."" :)"
9902,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,1.0,Amazing professor.
9903,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1304,5.0,2.0,By far the best professor I have ever had. He truly cares about you passing.
9904,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,4.0,"Very great professor, he explains thing where you understand it and always eager to help when you need it. Its a really straight forward class if you pay attention you will definitely pass."
9905,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"I feel lucky to of had him as a teacher, he's a real gem. He's organized, funny and he really breaks it down so it's easy to understand. You can tell that he truly loves what he does. I highly recommend him whether you struggle with math or not."
9906,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"Great professor, he is so smart too. Class is easy if you put attention and if you have any questions he will help until you understand the problem."
9907,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,ALGEB1314,5.0,1.0,I absolutely loved going to class. He gives partial credit for wrong answers. Also he almost never keeps you for the full class. therefore there is plenty of time to do take home quizzes and other classes homework.
9908,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,Great professor! Funny and gets to the point.
9909,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MAT0304,5.0,3.0,"I loved taking Professor Martin. He cares about you and your grade. He wants you to pass. I liked the way he helped you with your work. He didnt make you feel dumb, he understood you and your struggles and helped you see your mistakes. I would take him for all my math classes if I could. Took him in June. Great guy and personality really funny."
9910,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,Hands down one of the best teachers I've ever had. Not only is he funny &amp; down to earth but you can tell he loves what he does. I've always struggled with math until I took his class. He breaks it down &amp; makes it easy to understand &amp; he doesn't make you feel stupid for asking questions. I refuse to take any other math teacher while at TCC.
9911,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1304,5.0,1.0,"Greatest teacher and easy to understand, a must have for all algebra students"
9912,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Martin is probably the best possible prof you could have for algebra. He makes his lectures incredibly easy to understand. He DOESNT use MyMathLab which is fantastic. Show up for lectures tho so u dont fall behind. Take him especially if math isnt your strong suit. 10 take home quizzes, 4 tests (1 dropped) and a final."
9913,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Martin is thee best math professor you will ever have in any college. Prof. Martin somehow explains everything so nicely, and he makes it fun to come to class. Missing a day will throw you off, just cuz its math. His teaching style and personality make math comprehendible. Don't schedule any classes after his, so you can do hw right away ;)"
9914,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Martin is an excellent professor and I cant say enough good things about him. I am horrible at math &amp; enrolled in his class coming from developmental math. He is very good at explaining things &amp; he is hilarious. Honestly, I could have made an A if my attendance had been better. I HIGHLY recommend him, especially coming from developmental math!"
9915,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,"Math is my worst subject but he's such a great profesor I managed to ace his class. It consists of weekly take home quizzes(1-2), 4 exams, plus the final. he drops the 2 lowest quiz grades and 1 exam. He usually gives reviews for the exams and as long as you know how to do those problems you shouldn't have any trouble when it comes to the tests."
9916,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,2.0,"I took Mr. Martin for developmental math and statistics. He is such an awesome teacher. He took the time to keep explaining when I didn't understand something. I wish he taught at uta also! Would take again!! He is hilarious, so come to class :)"
9917,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1301,5.0,2.0,"Took the ALEKS class with Mr. Martin. He's just awesome. Nice guy, very helpful if you need it and very supportive. There's not a lot of interaction in the ALEKS classes, but you can tell he likes being a teacher. He doesn't sit at his computer the entire class time, he walks around and helps. I look forward to taking another class with him."
9918,565070,John,Martin,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,2.0,Love his teaching style. He is funny and doesn't overwhelm you with too much at once. I wish he taught higher levels of math so I could stick with him. Tests are based off the quizzes and he drops the lowest grade of each. He will help you with questions and really wants to see his students succeed. Take him!
9920,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,1.0,5.0,DO NOT TAKE ONLINE!!! Worst decision I ever made. Especially if you have no prior knowledge you will not understand a thing and you will be very lost. Exams are proctored and the videos he send barely helps. His notes help a little. You will literally be teaching yourself the whole time.
9921,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,Dr. Adam was an amazing professor and he did offer lot of extra credit too. He is good at details on lecture. His tests was pretty hard but you must study harder this class.
9922,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,ANP2402,3.0,4.0,"His test are extremely hard. I would try to avoid him. However his notes are extremely useful but testing wise is a bit to hard to handle. Hes a great teacher who loves his profession. I feel like he was easier past years, he may have changed up his teaching style to now were its pretty difficult and challenging. Good luck !"
9923,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,2.0,5.0,His tests were extremely hard and not just because of the class. His questions didn't make any sense and they would have spelling and grammar flaws which made it hard to understand. He didn't use his time very well either
9924,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,4.0,"Fair professor. There are NO OPEN NOTE FINALS or TAKE HOME TESTS (so Im not sure why someone said that) He writes needed information on the white board and students copy them into our notebook. Get ready for your hand to hurt, you WILL be writing notes the entire class period. If you dont study youll regret it. Does not give out review sheets."
9925,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,"Professor Adams has been the most helpful and understanding professors that I have ever had. I truly struggled in this class, but he is more than willing to help you and gives you a second chance if needed. There are TAKE HOME TEST(S) and OPEN NOTE FINAL(S)!!!! If you are wanting to learn as well as be put to your limits this is the class for you!!"
9926,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,2.0,"Had Adams for both A&amp;P 1 and 2. He is a very knowledgable, personable, and fantastic professor! I already have a BS but Adams taught better than any other professor I had. I don't get why people are saying his tests are so hard when they're literally straight from his notes. As long as you study his notes, the tests are easy!"
9927,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,1.0,"Adams is a true blessing. Im not gonna lie his test are extremely hard. He teaches from papers so use your text book for clarity. Omg he gives so much extra credit, super understanding and really wants you to make it. I wouldnt take him again only because his in class test were so hard. You get 3 take home test and extra credit is negotiable"
9928,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,5.0,"Hes changed his teaching style, from what i heard his class used to be easy. 2 take home test and 3 in class test, the take home test arent worth as much as the in class test. He let us use a note card on the test, the class still failed. He doesnt teach from a power point he reads from PAPERS. If i knew what i know now i wouldn't have taken him."
9929,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2402,3.0,4.0,"Honestly, don't know why Dr. Adams has such good ratings HIS TESTS HARD. Took him over summer, tests: 2 in class, 1 take home, 1 open book(it was the final &amp; hardest one). Also, the lectures are not interesting because they are from his notes and it's easy for your mind to wander. But he is a great person! I loved talking to him!"
9930,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2302,2.0,4.0,"Dr. Adams is a great person who has a wonderful ability to connect with students which is great for teaching. The only problem is that he can't teach. His lectures are extremely hard to follow as he loses focus often, and then when you get the test you recognize absolutely nothing. Hes an easy grade because he give out 3 test. Will not learn."
9931,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,5.0,"Professor Adams is a very caring and funny guy, however, his tests are extremely difficult and tricky and for someone who never fails tests I managed to do that in his class. Getting an A felt nearly impossible even with all the extra credit done"
9932,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,5.0,5.0,"I have mixed feelings about Dr. Adams. Hes very caring, actually the most caring professor Ive ever had! Lectures were interesting I felt like I learned and understood. I studied &amp; felt confident until I saw his exams... very tricky. Labs are like lecture. I could have made an A, but like I said his exam were a challenge for me."
9933,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Adams is a nice and funny professor. He cares about his students for sure. His tests can be quite tricky, however, if you read the notes and your book, you should be okay. A&amp;P is a difficult class so don't expect to make an A without studying. He gives us a few take home tests that do help out our grades and his final is not comprehensive."
9934,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,4.0,1.0,"Had Adams for lab. We didnt do a single dissection or lab. He lectures the entire time from the lab book, homework is due every class. You do look at models at least. 3 multiple choice exams, hard exams w trick questions. Nice professor, but gets off topic. Gives extra credit &amp; tries to review before tests, but again just gets off topic."
9935,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP1,5.0,2.0,All I will say is he is awesome and he knows the material.
9936,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP240140524,3.0,3.0,"I took him for lab, but were mostly like lecture. Didn't really dissect, but he is really straight forward to what he wants on the lab exams. He is really interesting. Would take him for lecture maybe not for lab.... but good prof. Make sure to buy your lab book, we definitely use it, but just the lab reviews."
9937,990535,John,Adams,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,ANP2402,5.0,4.0,10/10 reccomend. Make sure to pay attention.

9962,310342,Laura,Wood,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HIST1302,1.0,4.0,Other reviews are a lie. Took over the summer and the workload was unbelievable. Do not take unless you're a history major. Her lectures are long and all over the place. She posted a review to take notes while watching her lectures and I had to look up most of my answers online. She was all over the place and unhelpful.
9963,310342,Laura,Wood,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HISTO1302,1.0,4.0,Do not take this class as a quick class done in a month or even over the summer. Only take this class if you are taking one class and love history. She teaches as if you are a history major and expects you retain all this information in a short period of time. Her lectures are boring and off topic! She is a history major professor nothing more.

9967,310342,Laura,Wood,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HIST2322,4.0,4.0,"Very difficult! You have to work hard for your grade, but she is a very knowledgeable prof! Exams are intense so make sure you use her outlines. Once you figure out what she expects from you, it becomes easier. If you like History you will like her class. Better than US History for the 58th time."
9968,310342,Laura,Wood,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HIST301,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Wood was pretty strict and make you work harder too. She is talk very fast, and you must effort this class. This is not easy to get A."

9973,310342,Laura,Wood,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HIST1302,4.0,4.0,"Had Professor Wood for the 2019 spring semester, and she was a great teacher. She was enthusiastic about what she was teaching and whatnot. You had to work for your grade and take detailed notes in class, which is why if you don't go to class, you won't do good in tests. Assignments and Quizzes were not hard, but they were time-consuming."
9974,310342,Laura,Wood,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HIST1302,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Wood may sound like she's strict, but really she's just doing her best in helping you succeed. However, you will have to work for your grade, and by that you're gonna have to take handwritten notes in the lectures, and watching additional videos she puts up on Blackboard.

9977,310342,Laura,Wood,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,3.0,5.0,"She ""teaches"" as if you already know the material. She expects you to keep up with current events as she frequently refers to them. She gives pop quizzes and there is not much leiniency in her grading. I felt like I was behind the whole time because she acted as if these things are common sense. Wouldn't recommend if you aren't great at govt."

Took him for both A&amp;P I and II!"
9984,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AANDP2401,5.0,4.0,I took him online over the summer in an 8 week A&amp;P course. I was prepared to fail because we could not meet in person and the class in so hard. I was 8 months pregnant while taking this course and he worked with me with extended test dates when I was sick and even gave me 4 extra days to take the final when I was in labor. He is so caring! 10/10!!
9985,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,3.0,3.0,I received my 2nd C in my college classes while taking this class. A &amp;P is hard not too even mention taking it online during the summer. Professor Barton is so passionate about teaching and really cares about his students. He really wants everyone to do well.

9986,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"Professor Barton is an amazing professor. He truly cares about his students' success and gives you the materials needed to do well in the class.

9988,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,2.0,5.0,"This class was the hardest one I have taken in my 2 years of attending. I basically had to teach myself, the test were very hard. No review or hints as to what may be on them. Listening to lectures didn't do much help, he talks about his family most of the time getting sidetracked. Powerpoint format was crappy, and had a lot of unnecessary slides."
9989,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"Professor Barton is the most caring professor I have ever met! He really cares about his students and gives great advice on how to pass his class! You really do need to study for this class.

9990,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP1,5.0,3.0,Professor Barton loves his job and it shows in the way he teaches. He breaks everything down so you can understand it and also records his lectures so you can go back and refresh your memory when youre studying. AP1 is hard so youll have to study a lot to get an A but its all worth it in the end!
9991,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP1,2.0,3.0,Attendance mandatory so GO! got off topic too much and test was hard!
9992,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP1,5.0,4.0,Mr. Barton is far the best teacher I have had at TCC.

But if you follow his lectures and power points you will pass. The review is his PowerPoints and and they help out so much.
9993,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,"Interesting, clear lectures make even hard concepts make perfect sense. Offers lots of extra credit. Detailed tests with some fill-in-the-blank, but fair."

When studying something I just didnt understand. He met with me on multiple occasions until I understood. Hes tough, in a good way. What you put in will determine your grade. Work hard, you will learn a lot and will pass."
9996,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,"Overall a very good professor. He makes analogies that we can understand to help us remember, also tells a lot of stories that go with the lectures. Tests are very in depth and you have to study and put work in this class or you won't pass."
9997,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2402,3.0,5.0,"Definitely very smart guy, knows the material very well, very passionate about the subject, also entertaining, but when it comes to the test they are very very hard and his PP is not enough to pass this class, so you have devote your all this class to read the book and listen his lecture otherwise it is hard to make a good grad!"
9998,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,4.0,"Absolutely the best professor I've ever had. Its a shame I only get so many characters to say something. Definitely a class that you have to work for your grade, but that has more to do with the content rather than the professor. Barton makes it so easy to pass and keeps you interested from the first to last day. Absolutely cares about his students"
9999,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP1,4.0,4.0,Professor Barton was great! This class is incredibly difficult and I wont say he makes it easy but he makes it bearable. He is a great lecturer and his tests come mainly from his ppts. (pay attention to the small details like charts &amp; illustrations). He does not give study guides but he did cowrite the lab book so use the objectives as a guide.
10000,190262,Jerry,Barton,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,4.0,Mr. Barton is a great professor. This course is a lot to take in but he tries to make it as understanding as possible.

No tests. 1 group project over a book, super easy. Not necessarily the best teacher if youre looking to actively learn psychology- her class is more like watching a documentary and then chatting with friends than it is learning information"

Professor Nolte is sweet and understanding."

All you have to do is really study to memorize and you will be fine. I rated her difficulty a 4, do to the fact that she wants you to memorize it and learn it, not just take a class and move on. Easy A ""if"" you truly study."
10026,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1315,5.0,4.0,"Took this class only because I had to, but walked away glad I did. I learned so much more than I expected to. Her lectures are pertinent, not just to humanities but to life as well. Sure, this class wasn't the cakewalk I anticipated, yet I looked forward to it and appreciated the challenge. Wish more professors had her passion and knowledge."
10027,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUM1301,5.0,3.0,"Prof H was sweet and really helpful. She lectures about fine arts, dance, art, music, different eras and ALWAYS provides a visual for her students to see. Always willing to answer questions and help you out. Its mainly lecture and 4 tests that are easy if you study well. You should walk out the class feeling more aware of the world and enlightened."
10028,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1315,5.0,3.0,"Umm, yeah--notes were allowed, just discouraged. HELLO! Free study guides provided, no texts required to buy! Funny how OTHER students took notes and got no grief about that. Four exams means plenty of opportunities to pass--and that is the norm for Intro courses, so don't know what the whining is about. Hilarous and engaging lectures, take her."
10029,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1315,1.0,5.0,"This was probably one of the worst professors I've ever had. Her tests were way to complicated and she expected way to much. Did not like her at all and wouldn't recommend her to anyone. We weren't allowed to take notes and we only had 4 grades the whole semester so you screw up on one test, you're done for."
10030,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1315,5.0,2.0,Ms. Hosty's class was my favorite class this semester. Her lectures were something I would regret missing if I was absent. You will know immediately though that she dislikes postmodernism. Very easy A if you can memorize images of paintings and the according artists. She will introduce you to art that you probably hadn't considered much. Take her!!
10031,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,5.0,2.0,"By far the best professor I have ever had, and will probably ever have. She cares about what she teaches and presents the class with useful information that you will use for a lifetime. If you ever get the chance to take one of her classes, DO IT!!"
10032,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMAN1301,5.0,1.0,Professor Hosty was the best teacher that I've had at that campus.  She was real and wasn't afraid to speak her mind.  She spoke the truth and I believe that no other humanities teacher would've like her.  She's one of a kind and very intellegent.  I would like to thank her for taking the time out to teach us about what's important.I will miss her.
10033,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1310,4.5,2.0,Great professor! Very knowledgeable and up to date with current events. She spends her class time actually teaching you with great information. Wish I could take her class again!
10034,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,5.0,2.0,"I MISS HER ALREADY. SHE WILL ENLIGHTEN YOUR WORLD WITH KNOWLEDGE.SHE IS UNIQUE, INTELLIGENT,AND CARING.ITOOK HER CLASS,THOUGH IT WAS NOT REQUIREDAND AM WILLING TO RETAKEITANYTIME.TAKE HER CLASS IF YOU DESIRE A REAL EDUCATIONAND TO MAKEWISER CHOICESIN LIFE.SHE WILLFILL YOUR BRAIN WITH USEFUL KNOWLEDGE AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO BECOME A CRITICAL THINKER."
10035,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMAN101,5.0,1.0,"The best professor i have taken for humanities. I enjoyed this class so much that i can retake it again for the fun of it.This professor is highly educated,intelligent, and quite clear. i would recommend her class to my friends."
10036,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,4.5,3.0,Hosty is the bee's knee's.  Never had a class as important to my life as this one!
10037,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,5.0,1.0,"Awesome Professor and an awesome class! She is ALWAYS on time and is ALWAYS up to date in ""Our World"", she know's more about stuff and is so willing to share if you'll just listen. Class is Not Mandatory, but if your smart; you won't miss a single lecture.  All the staff at TCC and other campuses could use her class, she is the bomb of knowledge!"
10038,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,4.5,1.0,If you cant stand the heat Stay out of her kitchen! She is CRAZY! Tells it like it is! She's not afraid to admit fault or point the finger. She doesnt sugar coat stuff and will offer her opinion in droves! Most irritating thing is she tries to talk overe the volume of the videos she's showing lol Awesome teacher. She shd get a raise!!
10039,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,5.0,1.0,"Prof Hosty is one of the best instructors I have been fortunate to have. Every class seemed to be a new adventure. She takes her job seriously, so she does everything possible to give you all the facts. She doesnt mind expressing her opinion, but loves to get feedback. Her class is a must. Thanks Prof H"
10040,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1310,5.0,1.0,I am really going to miss this class! If you have the opportunity to take a class taught by Ms. Hosty then do so!
10041,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,5.0,3.0,Prof Hosty is one of those educators that you know you'll never forget!  Take all the classes you can with her.
10042,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,5.0,1.0,Professor H is awesome!!!  She is so funny and just tells it like it is.  I laughed so hard in this class.  Great teacher exams are easy.  She gives you everything you need for test!
10043,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMAN1301,5.0,1.0,Professor H is awesome!!!  She is so crazy and you will be laughing during every class. She is honest and gives you everything for her tests. If you don't make an A then you never will because she is one of the few professors who literally tells you what is one each exam.  Take her for humanities you won't regret it!!!!!
10044,1129930,Margaret,Hosty,Tarrant County College (all),English,HUMA1301,5.0,1.0,I had her for Intro to Humanities. She was the most refreshing teacher I've ever had. She likes to be honest with you and to the point. She also wants you to succeed so she gives you study guides based solely on the conext of the tests. Another awesome thing you don't need a text book!
10046,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEOL1405,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Fairbanks is seriously an angel! I am having to have surgery in the middle of the semester, and he is working with me so I don't get overwhelmed or behind. He is one of the kindest prof. I've ever had. Also, if you put in the work and turn everything in on time, it's a really easy class and an easy A."
10047,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEOL1405,5.0,1.0,"Trust these reviews; he's the best prof I've ever had! He only has 1 assignment a week that's mainly done as a class. He assigns 0 HW, even test reviews are done in class. He genuinely cares for his students, is always available &amp; happy to answer any questions. He allows you to retake HW/tests many times if you just ask. His class fills up quickly."
10048,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1404,5.0,2.0,"Best teacher I've ever had! He explains things so you can understand him. Online, he gives videos to explain each assignment so you can't fail. You get three tries and he will tell you what you did wrong so you can fix it. You learn so much, but he makes it easy. Only lessons and quizzes, no tests. No proctorio. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!"
10049,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1404,5.0,2.0,"Absolutely the best professor i've ever had, there's a good reason his rating is so high- not that he checks it. He genuinely and earnestly cares about every single one of us, and goes so far as to openly apologize if he thinks he's made us uncomfortable or spotlighted us too much. Had him in covid lockdown and honestly, thank god. He's amazing."
10050,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,2.0,Josh was such an amazing instructor and just all around one of the nicest guys. I am jealous of you if have the opportunity to take his class or the first time!
10051,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEOL1401,5.0,1.0,Mr. Fairbank was so amazing professor that I've ever met! He willing help you so much.
10052,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1301,5.0,3.0,"The best professor you could possibly have! Open to feedback and has genuine compassion for his students, really respects your boundaries and apologizes freely. One of the best people I've ever met, and an outstanding teacher."
10053,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEOL1403,5.0,1.0,"TAKE HIS CLASS. Josh is so great. I took his 8 week courses for Physical &amp; Historical Geology (1403&amp;1404) and it was the easiest most interesting class I've ever took here at TCC. He's really caring, helpful, and hilarious. There are at-home quizzes for each lesson, and all of the answers are given during lecture, the exams are super easy! Easy A!"
10054,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1401,5.0,3.0,Hes a 500/10
10055,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEOL1401,5.0,1.0,Mr. Fairbanks was by FAR the best science professor I have had and definitely the most caring professor I have ever had at TCC. He works hard to make sure you understand the material and gives you many chances to make a good grade. He is understanding and very helpful.
10056,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1404,5.0,1.0,"Great guy, super inspirational and tries to relate rocks to your degree ! Anyone should take him. My favorite class ever!"
10057,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1404,5.0,1.0,"He's the best Professor I've ever had! You wont regret taking him! He supplies all the tools you need for this class, aside from paper and pen, but then again if you asked I'm sure he would get some for you! TAKE HIM!"
10058,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,1.0,"Josh is AMAZING, Show up to class and you will pass with an A, If you miss a lot you'll probably get at B. The content is a little challenging but all you have to do is ask questions and he will explain it perfectly to you!!"
10059,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,1.0,"Best Professor I have had at TCC. I had him for my community learning class (GEO-ART) and it was my absolute favorite class. The material is very straight forward and he makes it simple to understand. Quizzes are online and you're given MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS! Pretty easy class, only way you could fail is if you don't put any effort. Totally recommend!"
10060,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1404,5.0,1.0,"Josh was the best professor I've had at TCC in five semesters here. He's funny, so encouraging, and notices and appreciates when you listen in class. His lectures are super easy to keep up with and he keeps the class busy by moving mentioned rocks around the class to touch. Quizzes are straight from the worksheets. Unlimited attempts. TAKEHISCLASS"
10061,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1405,5.0,2.0,Loved the community learning classes and how they combined material from Art and Geology. The instructor work well together.
10062,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,1.0,"Cool teacher and nice class. Show up, pay attention, do the assignments and it's an easy A."
10063,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1404,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I've had. Very helpful if you miss class, or you don't understand."
10064,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,1.0,Awesome professor and he's very helpful if you don't understand.
10065,1193454,Josh,Fairbanks,Tarrant County College (all),Geology,GEO1403,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Fairbanks makes learning science fun and understandable. His teaching style implements hands on, media/pictures/videos, and class discussion. Prof. Fairbanks can help those that don't like/don't have experience in science, and turn u into loving geo! Field trips r optional. don't take geo1401, take his classes instead, u wont regret it ;)"
10067,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,2.0,3.0,"I know most of this his rates are good but during this pandemic he has not made attending his class easy. Even in the tough times of online classes he wasn't very helpful or lenient on grades. I asked if there was anymore I could do to help my grade because i was taking 4 other classes and teaching myself and he basically said ""Tuff luck""."
10068,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,Burnside is honestly an amazing teacher. We all went through many difficulties this sommer due to the pandemic but he made up for it. My course was originally supposed to be in person but was moved to online. He goes out of his way to teach you how to learn in his class and as long as you watch his lectures and memorize what's needed you're golden!
10069,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,Amazing lectures he explains everything so thoroughly and gives a lot of examples.
10070,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Burnside is an amazing professor! With all of the circumstances currently going on, he was extremely understanding and provided ample time to complete exams and assignments. Was easily accessible outside of class and answered all questions fairly. Awesome and funny as well!"
10071,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,3.0,"Dr Burnside is a pretty good professor. I had him for A&amp;P 1&amp; 2 and would take him again in the future if hes an option. Hes fair, makes up for his mistakes, and gives extra credit. I had him online due to COVID and he taught to the best of his ability. If you pay attention to lecture you can def get a good grade. I wish I had him for lab too!"
10072,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,2.0,1.0,If you are taking class online - avoid. Not very organized communication. If it was ftf class would be different..
10073,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,5.0,3.0,"I took this course in the summer and due to COVID 19, it was online. Although it was challenging and there were many technical difficulties throughout, Dr. B taught the class online to his best ability. When there was a mistake on his end, he was always fair and gave us extra points. His stories were always interesting and I learned A LOT!"
10074,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,3.0,"He really made me love biology again, he finds a way to put it in a storyline, everything you learn is a puzzle piece from him, and he fits into perfect sense. I loved the atmosphere in his class, he always made it comfortable and fun to learn."
10075,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,2.0,He IS the best professor I've ever had and I wish I could take him again in my future classes you will not regret taking his class.
10076,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1406,5.0,4.0,"Dr. Burnside is such a gem! He's very dry humor but it helps lighten up Bio. Very willing to work with students outside of class and will take time to explain concepts thoroughly. He does put about 14% of grades in pop quizzes so stay with your reading and lectures. Listen closely, he usually tells you what to look for when studying for exams."
10077,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,5.0,3.0,"Amazing! Lot of typical ""dad jokes"". Uses bunch of analogies for better understanding . Few pop quizzes. Just study the powerpoints and you will for sure pass. Didnt use book. Highly recommend taking him for AP 1 and 2. Only a few oppurtunities for extra credit. Not that many grades in gradebook so one small mishap could effect grade tremendously."
10078,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,3.0,"I necessarily would not take him again for lecture because he gets off topic very easily but if you can take him for lab TAKE HIM. He gives you mini tricks that many other AnP teachers don't give, he gives free time in lab so you can study."
10079,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,3.0,"Good professor took two classes from him, and would've taken a third had it worked out. Makes the lecture easy to follow along and does best to ensure that the students understand content before moving on. Pay attention to all things mentioned even if it seems unrelated it might show up as a test question. Pop quizzes are to be expected."
10080,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,4.0,"I didn't know this was a nurse course nor that I needed to take Bio 1 &amp; 2 before Which I took neither. Im just here for an associates taking this class was like taking spanish 2 before spanish 1, but if I was still able to pass without any prior knowledge that should tell you what kind of professor he is. 11/10 he was great and knows his stuff"
10081,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2401,5.0,5.0,"Good professor! The class was hard because the material is hard and there is a lot to learn. To me, the hardest part of the class were the lab practicals, but I would still suggest taking him for lecture and lab. For the lecture tests, study his PowerPoint slides and for lab, just study, study, study!"
10082,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO2401,2.0,3.0,Took a&amp;p I with him over the summer. 3 tests and accumulative final. Reads straight off the powerpoint and will go off on some random tangent and waste an entire class. I am surprised he has not gotten in trouble for some of the things he says. Nobody minds other viewpoints but nobody cares in a science class.
10083,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL2402,3.0,4.0,Dr. Burnside pop quizzes and test questions come from his powerpoint presentations. His final is comprehensive and consists of recycled questions and new ones. The key is to memorize the powerpoint slides even the details because they will show up on questions. He has 1 extra credit for 5 points for a 5k . It was a lot of info for a summer course.
10084,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,AP2401,5.0,3.0,I am now in nursing school and I can say that he truly prepares you for what is coming. I am passing all my classes and he gave me the strong foundation I needed for nursing school. Take notes from what he talks about in class and STUDY the power points. I never touched my book. He's hilarious and makes a hard class fun. Hands down he is the best!!
10085,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1401,4.0,2.0,"Burnside is all in all a great prof. Eh, kinda funny. Youll figure out pretty fast that he loooooves talking about his life stories but his lectures are WORD FOR WORD what will be on pop quizzes and tests. If you take him, you will for sure pass."
10086,1845127,Craig,Burnside,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO238,4.0,5.0,"Burnside was a sight for sore eyes with A&amp;P. Difficult subject but teaching style and humor was worth it. Gives extra credit you just have to run/walk a 5K (easy, right?). I recommend attending the SI sessions, they will guide to. The final is a collection of past exams questions, so when he hands the back analyse your mistakes."
10088,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOV2305,4.0,3.0,Good professor she is very smart and talks very professionally I didnt buy the book and I passed so its not really necessary even though she said to buy it. Her lectures can seem a little boring but other than the small amounts of work its pretty easy
10089,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,"one of my favorite professors this past semester, she is so caring and really tries to help us learn. some might say her class is boring but i really enjoyed it since i learned alot ! would totally recommend her for gov. just as long as you take noes and pay attention youll easily pass her class."
10090,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOV2305,4.0,2.0,"Dr. Musgrove is an good professor. Her lectures can be a little long, but short enough to always get out of her class early. Also she only give out extra credit, 3 assignments, 4 test, and a final exam, which you should all pass if you just study and listen to her powerpoints. This class can be a good A/B."
10091,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,Dr. Musgrove is an amazing professor and she cares about your success in her class.
10092,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOVT2305,5.0,4.0,AMAZING PROFESSOR! THIS IS WHAT COLLEGE IS ALL ABOUT. I LOVE IT!
10093,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOVT2305,5.0,4.0,"This was the best online course I have ever taken. I wish all of my online classes were this good. Dr. Musgrove responded to emails within about 8 hours, which was good because I know she also teaches in-classroom classes. When I stopped by during her office hours, she was always amazing and thorough with explaining everything."
10094,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOVT2305,5.0,2.0,This lady is so smart. I love her class. You will learn something every day in her class. A lot of reading and note taking is required but that's what a college class is supposed to be about.
10095,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOVT2305,5.0,4.0,Dr. Musgrove is one of the best instructors I have ever had. I hate government but she makes it so interesting. Anyone who can't pass her class probably doesn't need to be in college. Her lectures are so interesting and relatable.
10096,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOV2305,4.0,2.0,Enjoyed the class. Beware that sometimes what she writes on the board will be on the test and it is no where else (book/powerpoints) so show up to class. Doesn't use scantrons. She made one test a crossword puzzle which was fun. A few papers but they are super easy. If you present your paper you get 10 points toward your grade. Very nice teacher.
10097,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOVT2305,1.0,5.0,"Worst class i ever take , she barely does power points and when she does , she goes really fast , also she talks through the whole class, and doesn't give test reviews, she expects students to read the chapters and still her test are not over them, she barely responds to emails, not taking this class again, waste of money."
10098,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOVT1301,4.0,3.0,I had her for government 1301 and she was very lecture based and she made us write 3 papers and we had a midterm and a final exam. She does provide powerpoints that help a lot when studying for the exams. Attendance was not required but if you want to pass then you need to go. Very boring lectures.
10099,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOV2305,5.0,2.0,no
10100,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOVT2305,3.0,2.0,Not a hard class but she does require a lot of work. The only thing i did not like is there was no test review.
10101,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOVT2305,1.0,4.0,her email responses when you have a question about an assignment are so shady and immature.
10102,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,FEDGOVT2305,3.0,4.0,"Good teacher, wouldn't take again though. She focuses only on tests. MUST take notes on everything she writes/presents on PPT, or you won't pass anything. She says a textbook is mandatory, but I did perfectly fine without. She has powerpoints that cover the textbook. She talks from beginning to end so be ready to focus."
10103,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOVT2305,4.0,2.0,"Professor Musgrove was a great teacher! Her class was easy, her test were easy and the little assignments she assigned were not hard at all. She didnt provide extra credit. That would have been amazing, but you really didnt need it due to how easy the class was. I WOULD RECOMMEND"
10104,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOV2305,3.0,4.0,She provides enough info to pass the class but you have to study well. She is kinda grumpy and tedious but she is great for this class.
10105,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,2305GOV,5.0,1.0,"The whole class is laid out for you on the syllabus. As Long as you listen during the lectures and take notes, you won't need to read the book. the only time I opened my book was to reference in one of the essays. Easy A class if you remember what was said in the lectures and review notes before test."
10106,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,2305GOV,2.0,3.0,"She will sit in class all day and tell you about how much she loves Bill Clinton and Obama. It's actually gotten to the point where it is down right annoying! She belittles the President almost daily. I don't care who you voted for, at all actually, but you should NEVER shove your opinion down someone's throat day in and day out. DO NOT BOTHER!!!!!"
10107,872733,Martha,Musgrove,Tarrant County College (all),Humanities,GOV2305,4.0,2.0,"I took this class online for summer II. Clear instructions,  4 DB, 2 one pg essays, 5 tests including final. Just ready your book and turn assignments in on time and you'll do fine."
10109,1023463,Cheryl,North,Tarrant County College (all),Sociology,SOCI1301,5.0,1.0,"No textbook needed. She is very nice and as long as do do your work, it is an easy A"
10110,1023463,Cheryl,North,Tarrant County College (all),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,3.0,"A really fun class! not many assignments, pop quizzes but you can use your notes. In class participation matters or it will be awkwardly silent when she asks a question. Also she offers extra credit. She doesn't assign much homework if any but when she does do it! it will save your life. She comes across as hard but she is really caring &amp; determine"
10111,1023463,Cheryl,North,Tarrant County College (all),Sociology,SOCI1306,5.0,3.0,"Ms. Noth is amazing. she really cares about her students. She is very funny and makes her class feel at ease. It's a big discussion, before you know it class is over. Gives tons of extra credit. She makes it so that everybody understands, and if for some reason you don't understand or ""get it"" she will explain until you do. Love this lady"

The class is mostly taken up by lectures and discussions to help you understand the concepts and apply them to situations around you. She also has a lot of extra credit opportunities."
10117,1023463,Cheryl,North,Tarrant County College (all),Sociology,SOC1301,4.0,2.0,I had Ms. North for online sociology and the assignments were very straight forward. I learned a lot of things in discussion boards and the assigned readings. the only thing is her feedback is very simple which left me a little confused on my grades.
10118,1023463,Cheryl,North,Tarrant County College (all),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"Professor North is one of my favorite instructors ever. Her class is so interesting and also very easy, there's never a dull moment in her lectures."

10127,1023463,Cheryl,North,Tarrant County College (all),Sociology,SOCI2336,3.0,3.0,"She is a pretty typical teacher. She allows some class time for discussions but for the most part her lectures are off of a power point and you will need to read outside of class. She gives reviews for the tests, though, and I find that very helpful."
10128,1023463,Cheryl,North,Tarrant County College (all),Sociology,SOC1301,5.0,1.0,"I took Professor North in a 16 week online class. She is very clear, organized, and gets your grades back to you within a few days. The assignments she has us do were easy and always on interesting topics. You get two chances on your quizzes, she accepts late work (with a penalty, of course), and offers extra credit. I highly recommend her."

All quizzes are given 3 chances and can mostly be found quizlet, not that you need it really. The discussion board questions can be tough but as long as you sound like you read up on the questions at least a little it's an A."
10137,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"*Not a history fan BUT I took this class online. Syllabus is spot on. There is quite a bit of reading involved, chapters are long. Overall workload was manageable as long as you read. Weekly quizzes with a midterm and a final that were not outrageous. If you HAVE to take history- I Would recommend Cervantez!"
10138,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"Took him for a maymester class. The class was very brief but for lasting 3-4 hours a day, Professor Cervantez did a great job! You can feel his energy and enthusiasm for history. He keeps the lectures interesting and extremely informational. Our class had no homework and 3 easy tests. Each test had 2 easy extra credit free response questions ."
10139,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,Lectures were more like told in forms of a story. Cracked some jokes here and there. Tests are not hard but do study. Overall a great professor.

10141,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,I took this class during the summer and it was very manageable. Professor Cervantez was clear on the assignments and his grading criteria. There were quizzes for each lesson but they were fairly easy.
10142,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Took him for summer and I highly recommend Professor Cervantes. He responds to your email, give you feed backs, there's several quizzes and tests are fairly easy."
10143,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Took his class during the summer. No homework, only 4 tests in total. His lectures are very interesting, make sure to take notes and you'll get an easy A."

10146,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST2312,4.0,2.0,"Professor Cervantez teaches a great Western Civ. 2 and made the curriculum easy to understand and the assignments easy to complete. He offers extra credit which is very helpful and was very understanding by bumping my 89 to and A. I would make sure to attend class as all the information for tests and quizzes come from the lectures, not a book."

10148,974624,Brian,Cervantez,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"If you have the opportunity to take a class with Professor Cervantez do it! There is no BS or fluff, he is very straight to the point and so are the assignments. I am hoping to get the opportunity to take HIST1302 with him as the Professor. If you participate and do your homework in a timely manner you will pass."

10151,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,"Professor Cowan is the best, Im not good with math classes and he makes the subject matter easy to understand. He cares about every student and if you show effort youll pass the class. I took a few different math classes and finally found Professor Cowan and was able to pass his class with a B. He drops lowest test grade, take him trust me."
10152,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,1324MATH,3.0,4.0,"Ok so let me start off by saying he's a really really nice guy and doesn't have a mean bone in his body. However, his style of teaching isn't necessarily for everybody. If you already are solid with algebra this will be a walk in the park. If not you're going to probably require tutoring and some one on one time with him."
10153,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,2.0,"I'm not super math savvy, but I did learn a lot during this course. Prof Cowan truly cares about EVERY single one of his students. I honestly hadn't taken a math class in a couple of years and I, overall, did good in this class. 100% recommend."
10154,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,2.0,This is by far the best math course I have ever taken. Prof. Cowan truely cares about his students. He has been teaching for many years and puts allot of words of wisdom within his teachings.
10155,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,2.0,"I'm mathematically inept and this class was honestly one of the best courses I have taken! I've never been very confident with algebra, pre-cal, or even calculus but Prof. Cowan breaks its all down for you! He's such a sweet guy and offers many opportunities for grade improvement. He's always open to questions and very helpful! I'd take him again!"
10156,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,4.0,Super nice and truly cares about his students. He will go out of his way to make sure everyone understands what is going on. He gives reviews and curves his test to give you credit for what you do know. I will definitely be recommending him to friends!
10157,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,3.0,Sweetest man ever!! Class can be confusing at times but he is always willing to help. Gives free 100 for seating chart grade. Homework every week but it is not graded. Gives partial credit and curves on tests. Take this professor if you want someone that cares about your success!
10158,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Great professor!!! Ive been out of school for 12 years. I passed his class with an A. Even though he does not grade most the homework assignments I recommend doing them, it will help keep your memory fresh on what was taught in class. If you are not sure about something he is happy to explain. I have registered to take his 1325 class next semester."
10159,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Cowan literally helped me through this math course with his lectures and eagerness to make sure the class understood the lecture, the tests were tough but he provides a test review on blackboard which is exactly the same as the test, the quizzes are very helpful towards the test as well, third time taking this class and he was worth it"
10160,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,4.0,3.0,"Took him online. Very helpful, responsive to emails and is willing to make test deadline exceptions if you have personal conflicts and communicate early &amp; respectfully. Tests are hard. Homework &amp; quizzes have multiple attempts and theyre left open for grade improvement. Would take him again."
10161,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"I am so thankful I took Mr. Cowan, he made getting an A in math easy and is always willing to help students outside of class if they need the extra help."
10162,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,2.0,"VERY VERY good teacher, i failed pre cal and dropped cal, but when i did them both with him i passed both with B, i could have passed calc 1325 with an A but i did slack off towards the last 2 tests. all u gotta do is pay attention in class, i did both 1324 and 1325 in the summer with him at a very fast paste, it wasnt bad, he gives test reviews."
10163,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1324,5.0,1.0,"TAKE HIM!! He explains everything very well, and if you are having trouble he wont make you feel dumb and will actually help you!"

I passed with an A and definitely recommend taking his class if you need a math course and are looking for a more forgiving professor. He normalizes the tests grades, so he gives your grade some help, and he has jokes. Hes a very nice guy and attendance is not mandatory at all, he never drops students."
10165,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,1324MATH,5.0,1.0,Hands down best teacher I have ever had for math. He is a great teacher and offers reviews for every test. He is willing to explain any questions you may have and he does not make you buy a code. Easy A!
10166,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1325,5.0,4.0,"Professor Cowan is incredible! He breaks down lectures and has clear grading criteria. Completion of homework and class attendance are super important. He gives warning that the calc course is more difficult than past math classes.  He gives extra credit, partial credit on tests, and drops lowest test and quiz grades. He will always help you!"
10167,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,STAT1342,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Cowan is the best professor I have ever had in my entire college career. This is the second time I have taken him. His class is awesome, a lot of fellow students do not understand the material and all you need to do is ASK. He will go over anything you need to. He wants you to understand math and he is able to teach it well. Love this man."

10170,1152492,Danny,Cowan,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cowan is the most careing professor I have ever had. He goes above and beyond on explaining the materiel and will do anything he can to help students. He is very respected, approachable and very good at what he does. He has worked with me throughout the semester.  I'll be taking him for statistics. He truly is the best!"
10172,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,3.0,"The only graded assignments in this class were the four tests. Other than that, all you have to do is watch the lectures, take notes, make flashcards, and study those flashcards. The lectures are really enjoyable to me so it's not even a chore. You can tell he cares a lot about the subject matter which makes the whole class a genuine delight."
10173,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,3.0,4.0,Took his class for fall of 2020. All online. Theres only 4 assignments... and theyre all exams. No reviews. The review is another lecture and he doesnt even go in depth about the essay questions. I think he made it only 4 exams to lighten the load of classes in general but hes doing a disservice. You will not make an A w/out SI.
10174,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,5.0,2.0,"Took his class online and was the best choice I ever made. All lectures are uploaded so you can go at your own pace. The lectures are long but he describes everything as if he was actually there which is pretty amazing. It's like listening to a podcast, that's how interesting he makes it. Take notes, review the notes and the tests are fairly easy."
10175,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,2.0,5.0,"I have no idea why this professor has good rating, he doesn't have review or anything, just taking notes down for an hour. Also, his test isn't easy, it's annoying."
10176,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,3.0,4.0,I wouldnt take this professor again. the work load was crazy. so much busy work. I took him during a mini mester which didnt help the work load. I mean I I got it done. but each chapter he had us do 6 assignments per chapter and 3 chapters a week.
10177,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1302,5.0,2.0,"Amazing Prof!!! Nice, clear expectations, entertaining lectures, and no homework. If you dont take notes you'll fail. The extra credit is EASY. He gives 4 tests and an optional 5th. Its a mixture of multiple choice, fill in the blank, and a short essay. THERE IS NO WAY TO FAIL IF YOU TRY"
10178,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,5.0,2.0,"Dr. H was an absolute gem! Took him during summer semester and am so happy I did. He clearly laid out his expectations for us: listen to lectures, take close notes during them, and find a study tool like Quizlet or making your own outlines to help you understand all information, you will be golden. He tells history like a (very awesome) story."
10179,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"Professor Hathcock is one of the best teachers I've ever had! Lectures are interesting and engaging, and you can tell he loves what he does, which adds to the quality of his lectures. Tests are pretty easy, and he doesn't grade essays harshly. 4 tests which consist of 20 MC questions, 10 fill in the blank, and one essay. Absolutely loved taking him"
10180,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,4.0,2.0,"I took Hathcock for a summer semester and I'm glad I did. Each week you're tasked with watching the pre-recorded videos (you NEED to take good notes when watching them), studying your notes, and taking the associated exam. If you take notes and study, you'll be able to get an A. He also posts the possible essay questions which was super helpful!"
10181,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST13011302,5.0,2.0,"He is a Great Professor! Lectures are in chronological order and very organized. All you need to do is listen and take good notes then the test should be easy. Grades are based on 4 tests (no homework) extra credits are optional. Even during COVID-19, he managed to finish in a high note. I end up taking both history 1 &amp; 2 with him. Highly Recommend"
10182,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,4.0,3.0,"15 Chapters to read (long!), 15 DB's, two reply's to students, and 4 exams over 4 chapters, last one - 3 chapters. It was kind of difficult for me because of so much info to absorb. If I were to retake, I would take it in person. Take notes &amp; try to study a few days prior to test because there are 10 fill in questions (hard) and 35 multiple choice."
10183,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,4.0,2.0,"The only thing you are graded on are tests. There are 4 tests, and the avg is your grade. Final is optional and replaces the lowest score. Tests are multiple choice, fill in the blank, and an essay. If I studied better I would've gotten an A. Nice professor with interesting lectures but boring for early mornings. Wish there were more grades"
10184,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,5.0,3.0,"My friends convinced me to take a different professor for 1302 and I regret it big time!! His lectures are very interesting and I learned a lot. He's also very nice so if you're putting in the effort he'll work with you on grades. Simple system: show up, take notes, pass the tests, optional final at the end. 10/10 recommend but don't skip."
10185,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,4.0,the DB and focus questions are easy grades - dont skip those. exams are only hard if you don't read the whole chapter (they're so long!) great professor though. work is manageable and not overwhelming. take this class if you want a semi easy A-B.

Homework is straight from the book, answer 3-5 questions, discussion board, and 2 responses. Grades pretty easy on homework. Read the chapters because there are no PowerPoints provided. There are 4 exams worth 100 points."
10187,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"He is super lecture heavy to get ready to take notes. No homework, just 4 mandatory tests and the final is optional and can make up your lowest test score and he offers 10 points extra credit for attending campus activities. Hes tests are consistent and fair 10/10 would recommend. Make this teacher your top choice for history."
10188,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIS1301,5.0,2.0,This Professor is amazing! Im an auditory learned so his lecture heavy class was very easy to me. You have to take good notes and study a little each day and youll do great!
10189,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Hathcock is my favorite professor at TCC by far. I hated history and it was my worst subject until I took his class. He really loves and knows his history, and he made every lecture interesting and enjoyable. All that is required to get an easy A in his class is pay attention and take notes. I highly recommend his class."
10190,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,USHIS1301,5.0,4.0,"Honestly, as long as you showed up to class and paid attention to the lesson he is giving you. You never needed the book!"
10191,1624417,James,Hathcock,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Do not get turned off by the syllabus, he sets very clear expectations and as long as you follow them you will get an easy A. This class is writing intensive but if you take time out of each day to work on homework it should be no issue. Great Professor!"
10193,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN1412,5.0,2.0,"Mrs Herrera's class was not hard at all. As long as you do your work you should be fine. I took an 8 week online class and I did not feel over whelmed at all. I made a high B only because i didn't do the Supersites in there entirety, but that was because i over loaded my schedule with enrolling myself full-time in another school. I recommend her!!"
10194,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,4.0,2.0,"There are several one page essays, and the essays are based off of movies. Neither the essays nor the presentations are unusually hard. The tests are difficult but you can make up for them on the projects."
10195,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,4.0,"Great class. Good refresher if it's been a long time since you've had Spanish classes. You'll have to study, but class is fun and relaxed."

10197,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,3.0,"The wintermester class had long and few class meets, but the professor helped time pass with movies and film reviews at the end of class."
10198,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,3.0,"Though attendance was not ""mandatory"", you do get graded on participation during class. So, it pays to be in class and participating. She also gives good feedback on presentations and written assignments. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and learned a lot in the process. If you put in the effort, you'll do fine."
10199,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,2.0,"Took her for the Wintermester and she is great! The wintermester class grades are composed of mainly movie reviews, presentations and tests. She goes over on what will be on each test. Presentations are simple and fast and not at all hard. I enjoyed taking her. Really recommend!!"
10200,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,3.0,"I would take her again, shes a great instructor!! I definitely recommend taking her!"
10201,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,2.0,I took Professor Herrera for SPAN 2312 as a Winter class. I felt like I learned the material so much better then in previous Spanish courses with other professors even though it only lasted a couple weeks. She is engaging and helpful.
10202,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, she knows her stuff. Would recommend anyone especially if you are not fluent. She's a great help."
10203,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,1.0,She cares about her students and is very patient.
10204,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,4.0,I really enjoyed this class. I did not know what to expect at first. My face lit up when I saw her walk into the room. She is a great teach and very helpful.
10205,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN2312,5.0,2.0,"Amazing teacher, one of my favorite classes I've taken."
10206,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN1411,5.0,4.0,There are alot of work for the online section. You must turn it in on time. She doesn't accept late work. 2 speeches you have to do. The first one you have to memorize it. She is a nice teacher and willing to listen to your situation. You can pass her class if you try your best.
10207,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN1411,5.0,1.0,Really nice professor and she always gives you a chance to get extra credit.

10210,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN1411,5.0,4.0,"There will be 2 speeches. The first one, you have to memorize it. The second one is a group speech. She may deduct points if you were to read from the note the whole time. She gives extra credits. There is a quiz every week, every two quizzes then there will be a leccion test. There are 5 leccions in Spanish 1."
10211,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN1411,4.0,3.0,Awesome professor and she helps out when you ask! Do not take if you are expecting a easy A. Do the homework and show up to class you will learn alot.
10212,2378745,Anel,Herrera,Tarrant County College (all),Languages,SPAN1411,5.0,4.0,She won't take late work. She gives extra credits from time to time. There will be alot of homework for the online section. There will be one speech that you have to memorize or you can read from a note but you can only get a B on that speech.
10214,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1301,4.0,3.0,"I think she is a great professor. She might sound like she is a terrible person, but she is actually really nice and helpful. She provides lecture outlines for each chapter, so it is much easier for you to understand what will be on the tests. And theres these chapter assesments, those are literally questions from the test. Make sure you STUDY!"
10215,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,4.0,"I took Professor Cash my first semester of college (Fall of 2019) and it is the best decision I've made! Her teaching goes beyond biology, she teaches you how to study, take notes, and overall prepared me for other college courses. It is definitely not an easy course, but Professor Cash wants you to succeed! Definitely recommend!"
10216,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,1.0,4.0,Do not take this class unless you are willing to invest a good amount of time. Even trying to get past Proctorio for tests is a bit challenging with how she words questions. If you work and are doing multiple classes be very ready to get very annoyed with this professor. She is not lenient in the slightest. Stay away unless you love wasting time.
10217,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,4.0,5.0,I will leave a very honest review in hopes to help someone else but keep in mind Everyone has a different exp with instructors. Ms. Cash was hard at first and the concepts were hard for me to grasp because i was dealing with a lot of personal things but if you can focus in class and study the material you will do fine. but you have to put in work.
10218,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,5.0,"Shes insane, but focused. Shes funny. Shes tough, shes fast so record the lecture, but she grades fair. She repeats important info all the time so you just have to be present and listen. Reading ahead helps, plus xtra cred. Shes clear about whats on the test, follow the study guide. Not an easy class, but if you care, youll be fine!"
10219,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,2.0,"she is a great teacher, you definitely have to work for a good grade, but she is very funny and if you read the book and watch bioflix you will be completely fine"
10220,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,2.0,5.0,"I'm an All-A student, but I had to drop her class because of the extremely harsh lab quizzes. I failed nearly every one; they're super difficult and plummeted my grade way down. I would not recommend her class!"
10221,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,1.0,5.0,"Get ready to go overtime in lecture and cash never has time for questions during lecture but she has time to make inappropriate jokes. She expects you to know that theres six of these things when the book only lists 5, and we wouldnt know that without her telling us. To add to this shes a very negative person. 1st test 70 questions AVOID HER!"
10222,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,1.0,5.0,I have her for bio in the fall this year and from what she has posted so far am sure she's going to be one of those instructors you will have to kiss up to in order to make a decent grade. She expects us to come in already having read chapter one and knowing the material. for someone like me who hasn't taken bio since high school this is insane!
10223,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,1.0,5.0,Class starts on the 20th and today is the 13th. she has already posted outlines and a test for us to do before the first day of class. Not sure why she would think this is a good idea because no one wants to do a test before they actually need to. She only posted the syllabus 13hours ago and expect us to get this book last minute. planning to drop!
10224,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,2.0,4.0,"She clearly has a passion for biology but isn't the best prof. out there. She talks way too fast, doesn't answer questions very well, and the tests have an insane amount of complex material that you need to learn for a course that is for non science majors. I would love to go out into the field with her but wouldn't take her class again."
10225,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,4.0,"Professor Cash will seem scary on the first day, but I promise she cares about preparing students for her tests. There are extra-credit assignments that will add towards your exam that unit which will help with studying. She allows one 3x5 index card you can write on for the test. You won't fail if you put in the effort."
10226,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,4.0,"Ms. Cash at first may seem like a hard head, but don't be fooled. She genuinely cares about each of her students. 5 opportunities to earn 5 bonus points toward each test. 4 lecture tests, lab quiz each week, and comprehensive final. She understands that students who r taking this class aren't going into the sciences and wants everyone to succeed."
10227,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,4.0,4.0,"She will scare you on the first day of class by yelling her expectations but if you do as she says and really try, you will pass the class. There are no grades other than the tests but she does allow you to make extra credit for each test. There are 4 tests and a comprehensive final. She allows the 3 x 5 index card on each test."
10228,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,3.0,4.0,"If you like a challenge, then I consider that you take this class. This is not 1 of those classes where you sit around &amp; get an easy A, you have to put in effort. Ms. Cash is a funny instructor, she has no filter which makes her lectures inserting. I have learned a lot about biology thanks to her. Also she lets you take a 3x5 note card to her exams"
10229,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,1.0,5.0,Mrs. Cash is one of the absolute worst professors I have ever encountered. She does not care about the students or your grade. Her test are very hard! She doesn't think that over half the class failing is a problem. Lecture heavy &amp; hard to know what she wants you to know from the information. Talks very fast &amp; horrible at answering questions.
10230,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,3.0,4.0,She goes too fast during lectures. Took a non biology major course and it was pretty difficult. Record lectures. Make sure not to miss lab. Extra credit points are low not worth it .
10231,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,3.0,"The BEST biology teacher you can take, 3x5 note card on test, gives extra credit quizzes, obviously you had to put your part to pass. You will not regret taking her!"
10232,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIO1408,5.0,2.0,You wont regret taking Mrs. Cash! Extra credit assessments on test and 3x5 notecard on test. Her lectures explain the material she expects you to know for the test.
10233,785124,Claudia,Cash,Tarrant County College (all),Biology,BIOL1408,4.0,4.0,You can pass Prof. Cash's class if you use all the resources given. The book is necessary so find it as cheap as possible (Amazon rental: $40). She gives outlines for every unit that follow her lecture and the book. 3x5 notecards are allowed for each lecture test! 1 point xtra cred assessments are a must for great test grades. Solid &amp; fair class.
10235,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"Great class. We switched from in-classroom to online, but it was still a interesting class. As long as you study your notes and do the reviews that she gives prior to tests then you should be fine! Highly recommend her for any psych class!"
10236,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2315,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. McCoy is AWESOME!! I love, love, love the class and this professor. Her class is interesting and was my favorite class Spring 2020. She doesn't trick you on tests. She gives great test reviews and if you participate in class you will learn and want to pass. And you will. I took the 1st test without ever studying and made a B. Final was an A!"
10237,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,3.0,"Read all supporting material/ take notes. Professor is very clear on grading, gives a few extra credit points. A few quizzes, tests, and short essay assignments. Overall, great class/professor."
10238,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,I took her class online. There was 15 quizzes and all open book. You will take 3 exams that are proctored. I made a B in this class and did not open up the book once. Just do the work and you'll pass.
10239,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,1.0,"I loved this class! she is super easy all you have to do is show up for class, she gives extra points by showing up, she does not give out any assingments but the tests are not hard either just show up to study session which gives you extra points as well. Her tests are multiple choice and it is really easy to make an A in her class!"
10240,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,2.0,4.0,Her online course is too heavy for summer season with frustrating proctors (16 chapters). The proctor is not important for the exam. Please do not take her online during summer.
10241,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC1301,5.0,3.0,"I LOVED THIS CLASS!! You have to come to class. She does not give out her powerpoints. She gives extra chances to gain points for the attendance assignments. If I had gone to class a bit more, I would have been able to get an A in this class. She loves what she does. She does REPLACE your lowest test grade with the comprehensive final. 4 MC tests."
10242,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,4.0,3.0,Took Professor McCoy's psych class online and loved it. Everything was well organized and easy to find. Would easily recommend her for anyone looking to take a psychology course.
10243,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,4.0,"McCoy was far by the greatest psychology professor ever. I took her online, I was nervous at first because it was my first online class, but she made the structure of the class organized. But she's a tough grader on DBs and essay so make sure you edit your writing a LOT. Provides extra credit opportunities. Replies fast to emails. Would take again!"
10244,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,4.0,3.0,"She's GREAT and knows everything about Psychology. I was very intrested in this class because she relates everything we learned to everyday life. She makes her own powerpoints and won't post them on Blackboard,so if you do not show up to class you miss valueable notes. The tests are exactly from the powerpoints notes, so show up and you'll succeed!"
10245,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,3.0,"Professor McCoy is by far my favorite professor ever! She is the nicest woman ever, and she wants you to succeed you just have to work for the grade. Pay attention to her reviews because they will help you get an A on the test. Not only does she teach really well, but she makes it very entertaining. Overall, she has a wonderful personality."
10246,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I have had. Understandable,and uses a lot of media to help explain the material. She's good with students who have social problems like me. And the tests are clear. Don't miss her class,as she doesn't have her PowerPoints on BB. Try not to miss her class,or get a friend to take notes for you."
10247,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"Prof. McCoy is an amazing teacher. Her passion for the subject she is teaching is obvious &amp; her lectures are engaging &amp; hilarious. Grade was based on 4 tests &amp; in class participation - show up! Lots of extra credit opportunities. Book is optional if you take good notes in lecture, but definitely useful. Moves quick, so learn to short hand."
10248,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2315,5.0,1.0,"I took her for the Fall semester, and she is so amazing. She really cares about her students and makes sure that everyone is engaged into the lecture. The lectures are super fun and interesting and she is very funny."
10249,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2314,5.0,3.0,TAKE HER! I enjoyed her class very much. She's funny and gives a lot of random extra credit. She also has test reviews for each test. Tests are all based of off her powerpoints though so if you miss one class then you have to ask someone for the notes
10250,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2301,5.0,3.0,I took her class in the Spring 2018 and loved the class! She made the subject very interesting and gave us a better understanding. She does move fast but thats college lol. Definitely recommend her! Randomly she would give extra credit if we showed up and a lot of students were missing
10251,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2315,5.0,2.0,Professor McCoy is awesome! Her lessons are very easy to follow and understand. Gives extra credit opportunities. Easy homework. She can be pretty hilarious and will make you laugh.
10252,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC1301,3.0,1.0,"I liked her but when we took notes she went super fast, she would just read then changed it and when asked to slow down you could tell she was annoyed. But other than that the class was interesting and easy, just put effort and you will pass."
10253,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"She's great! Very clear about what you need to know, even given a very specific study guide for exams. She uses PP but you can't get them online, so SHOW UP and TAKE NOTES. Her lectures are fun and usually interactive. She's an amazing professor and I would love to take her again."
10254,1148003,Yvonne,McCoy,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,4.0,2.0,"She is very upfront about what you need to know, and it all comes from the PowerPoint. She will not give you the PP if you skipped class, though, so always show up. She asks for class participation, but makes you feel stupid if you don't say exactly what she wants to hear."
10256,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,He is simply amazing!
10257,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rzeppa is just an amazing teacher in general. He had in-depth interesting lectures that go over exactly what will be on the test. He would always give us interesting historical facts that made his class enjoyable, then at the end of the semester had us write them down for extra credit. a great teacher who is relatable and fun take him!"
10258,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"He is a wonderful professor. He gives 4 exams for the semester and that is all he gives. Plus, he gives you a review for each exam. there is no reason not to get an A in his class. He gives Powerpoint lectures, but he makes them fun and entertaining. I am grateful that I get to have him again next semester for Hist. 1302. He is a great guy."
10259,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HISTORY1301,5.0,1.0,"Its 2020, I am taking a Govt class with a teacher that is very bad and just made me remember how good I had it with this professor. He is a very good teacher funny and doesn't try to make the class impossible to pass. He understands that were not trying to be history majors we just wanna do a lil work, but not too much and pass."
10260,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Prof. Rzeppa is a real gem. He is the only one who makes History looks super easy. You just have to record/note his lectures really carefully, and here you go an easy A. Try not to skip his class, every exam is from lecture."
10261,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,Oh man Professor Rzeppa is one of my all time favorite Professors! I wish i could take him for all my college courses! His class is based on lectures so if you miss a day you might want to get a buddy to pass you along some notes since all his exams are over his lectures. I really enjoy his class and would deff. take it again! Best wishes to him!
10262,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"Professor Rzeppa is an amazing teacher if you're going to take History. He can be a bit inappropriate at times, but his lectures are informative and he treats his class as less of a teaching area and more of a voluntary learning session. Don't take his online courses however since he's a pen and paper type of guy."
10263,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"I took this professor for the summer and it was the easiest class I have ever attended. His teaching method was really good and made me grasp the information. I would highly recommend, its truly an easy A."
10264,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,1.0,"Professor Rzeppa is an extremely laid back professor. Basically his only requirement is that you show up. It's almost impossible NOT to get an A if you pay even a little bit of attention. Tests are super easy. I ended with 98 and I barely had to study. He can be unprofessional at times, but if you're looking for an easy A, definitely go with him."
10265,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"100% recommend. Only has test grades, and 4 of them at that. The tests are around 15-20 multiple choice and an essay. The final is non cumulative, it simply serves as the last test. All you have to do is show up, take good notes, make some friends to help you study and you'll get an easy A. Shows a lot of movies and is really funny."
10266,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"Rzeppa is an amazing professor! But if you are planning to major in something involving history, I would not recommend. His tests are extremely easy, very short essay and 17 questions (normally fewer questions). He's very easy for the credit, he covers everything that you need to know and nothing extra!"
10267,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,Only grades are 4 tests which aren't difficult at all and even extra credit. He lectures most classes and they are entertaining and informational. Easy A if you show up. Great guy.
10268,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Rzeppa was by far the best professor i had all semester, not only because he gave me an A, but because his class relieved a bit of my stress from my other classes with his funny lectures and overall positive personality."
10269,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"Professor Rzeppa is amazing! I absolutely recommend him. I didnt like history in high school, but he absolutely changed my viewpoint. Makes the lectures interesting and funny! He lets you out of class early, and sometimes plays movies during class days if hes tired. He also gives always some test answers, so pay attention to his lectures! :)"
10270,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,You don't need a text book but make sure to take notes. He's a cool professor.
10271,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,2.0,1.0,"Mr. Rzeppa talks a LOT about his personal life. I wish we had a textbook because you have to completely rely on everything he says in his lectures, if you miss something you're screwed. No assignments which is nice. His tests are short but worded weirdly so somewhat hard."
10272,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,5.0,1.0,"Took Mr. Rzeppa for summer 1301 and 1302. He is an excellent, caring teacher and his lectures are never boring. (listen for answers) I would definitely recommend. Class consisted of 2 test and 2 essays."

10274,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,Mr. Rzeppa was an amazing professor. I took him this summer. He is a very caring person. I would highly recommend him. You will definitely learn a lot from this course. I can't wait to take 1302.
10275,1223943,Joseph,Rzeppa,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,1.0,"I use to hate history but he made it fun and interesting so i actually payed attention. He jokes a lot and gives ""downtown specials"" (answers) to the quizzes, all you have to do is listen and he will give you the answers to all the questions. I always looked forward to his class. I would definitely recommend him to others."
10277,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,The document that was given to us at the beginning of the class with all the due dates for everything was the one thing that helped me stay organized while taking the online class and I wish every professor did it like Ms. Santiago.
10278,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,the document she gives us with all the due dates really helped me stay organized and was the one thing that helped me the most.
10279,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,1.0,"BEST PROFESSOR, she cares about you passing! She'll do anything to help you pass.

She is VERY helpful and really wants you to succeed in her class. Gives videos of her explaining homework &amp; plenty of time to complete. Calander is provided at the beginning of the semester with all assignments &amp; due date so there are no surprises! Do the work and you will pass!"
10281,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1332,5.0,2.0,"Can't say enough good things about Mrs. Santiago!! If you can take her class, DO IT. I failed my TSI twice and I suck at math, and she made it so so easy. She makes the class fun and she is so dedicated! She definitely deserves a raise! During COVID19 she made it easy to work online and put time and effort into the course. TAKE HER CLASS!"
10282,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1332,5.0,4.0,"Mrs. Santiago is the nicest professor ever. Math has always been my hardest subject but thanks to her and the math lab at Tarrant County it's my favorite class. She is engaging, very helpful and with a good sense of humor. She is the only one I would recommend taking math from. Can't say enough nice things about her."
10283,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,3.0,Professor Santiago was amazing you can do the homework as many times as you need until you get the grade you want up until the due date. She posts helpful lectures on youtube as well to help you understand the homework. She makes sure you really understand the work so you have every opportunity to really learn
10284,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,2.0,"If you need an easy A in stats, pick her! Her tests are exactly what is off her reviews and gives extra credit. I took her online and she was great!! Tests are proctored(webcam) BUT if you study, you will do great! she lets us use notes on exams too!"
10285,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,4.0,"She is really awesome. It is hard because math online is hard in general. I find myself at the math lab every single day for homework, but thats because I work F/t. Her tests are proctored, but dont let that scare you, this class is hard regardless who you take. Her test exams are EXACTLY like the test review, so it's really helpful."
10286,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1332,5.0,4.0,"I'm awful at math, but Prof. Santiago helped me SO much. I actually made a far better grade than I expected because she made things easy to understand and was always willing to help. She's very funny and gets right to the point. The tests were kinda difficult, but not impossible. I'd definitely recommend her class to anyone struggling in math."
10287,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,4.0,3.0,"Do the work, watch the videos and do homework."
10288,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,3.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE her! She is SO hilarious! I love the way she lectures. She is very detailed in teaching and doesn't make you feel dumb if you ask a question. She emails after each class the lecture notes she wrote in class for future reference or for those who missed. Very thorough communication and grading. Definitely won't be disappointed.
10289,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,3.0,5.0,"Mrs. Santiago is not a bad Professor, and she is a lovely person in general. But she doesnt give any extra credit at all and her tests are difficult. You CANNOT skip class because this course is very lecture heavy and taking notes is essential in order to pass. She covers a ton of material in each class, so lectures seem extremely long and tiring."
10290,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1332,5.0,2.0,"I wish she could teach all of my math classes, but Professor Santiago is seriously the BEST math teacher! Print the notes from bb, and just fill in while she lectures! She gave out a TON of extra credit, and we had some multiple choice tests, which she provides the formulas! On top of that she is HILARIOUS, which makes the class that much better!"
10291,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1342,5.0,1.0,"Mrs. Santiago is an AMAZING professor. She is willing to go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material and quickly responds to emails. All homework is done on MyMathLab, there are four tests including the final that all come with identical test reviews. Show up, study your reviews, put in the effort and you WILL pass. Easy A!"
10292,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1332,5.0,1.0,"My favorite math professor ever, she is amazing! Explains things so well, and is always nice and funny. Homework is on MyMathLab and she always replies to emails quickly. There are four tests and a final! The review for the test is exactly like the test, but with different numbers! You can get up to 10.5 extra credit points on the final! Take her!"
10293,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH0302,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Santiago is an awesome professor! She explains everything in depth ,and makes sure that everyone understands the concepts. She will answer any questions, and help you with any problem that you have. She makes all deadlines very clear, and gives reviews before every exam. I would definitely recommend taking her for your math classes!"
10294,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1332,5.0,3.0,"Math is not my strong point by far. I am so glad I found Mrs. Santiago! If you are dreading math, don't! She will help you every step of the way and make you laugh while you learn. She is kind and patient and will do whatever needed to help you understand the concepts and succeed. Can't wait to take her stats class."
10295,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,MATH1314,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED THIS TEACHER!!!!!!! She makes math so easy! I'm normally horrible at it and I got an A. She will even move hw deadlines, gives chances to earn points, and is able to explain things so that you understand. She's very funny and makes class fun. Easy A! Completely recommend taking her."
10296,1315604,Brunilda,Santiago,Tarrant County College (all),Mathematics,STATS1314,5.0,3.0,Amazing. I loved her! I have never been good at math but I ended this class with a 95. Shes a great teacher whos patience and prepares you for exactly what you will be tested over! She breaks it down and makes sure everyone understands! I highly recommend her. Shes also fun and doesnt overload new material on you!
10298,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT2306,5.0,1.0,Easiest class ever! Your grade are based on 4 exams. Exams are exactly like the reviews. Take Mr. Jackson for an easy A.
10299,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"TAKE HIM!!! Litteraly easiest class ive EVER had. Entire grade is based on 4 exam grades, he does some extra credit questions on one of the exams. The reviews are exactly the test litteraly. If you attend class &amp; pay attention you can still learn alot. but showing up is not required. Just memorize every answer on the review and your good. Easy A"
10300,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,"Professor Jackson is absolutely hilarious! He's an amazing professor, and this is a super easy class. He gives an extra credit opportunity, 3 tests and the final, and two projects. This class is very very lecture heavy, and sometimes he does get off topic. However, come to class, take notes, do the reviews, and you'll get an A."
10301,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,TEXASGOVT,5.0,2.0,Super easy! I never showed up. His only grades are tests and the review is identical to the test. Easiest A Ive ever had.
10302,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT2305,3.0,2.0,His Govt 2305 class was super easy but very boring I honestly learned nothing because he would get off track a lot but if you want a federal govt credit he would make it be an easy A if you study the reviews of course. 3 exams 2 easy projects and offers a one time chance of extra credit.
10303,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,great teacher would take again for any other class. Easy A and the test questions were in the review.
10304,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,"He is the best professor! He is simply amazing, caring and hilarious! His lectures are interesting and you learn a lot. Took this class during the summer. There were 4 test no homework. Book was not mandatory or needed to pass. Study the power points and do his test reviews. He adds bonus questions to the test for extra points. Take Him!!!"
10305,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,He is just amazing
10306,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,Really enjoyed this class his lectures were interesting.
10307,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2306,5.0,2.0,"He was awesome, super funny and made the class interesting. By far one of my favorite professors. 11/10 would recommend"
10308,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2306,5.0,1.0,"Really easy, the test reviews are exactly as the tests. Attendance not really mandatory."
10309,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2306,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Jackson was one of my favorite professors! He uses his humor to keep the class interested and makes government interesting, even for those who find it absolutely boring. If you take notes and put time into studying, his class will be a breeze!"
10310,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,2.0,"Prof Jackson is an easy A, he is amazing and know his material."
10311,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,"I took professor Jackson over the summer 1 session and it was a piece of cake. His tests are the only assignments in his class. The reviews are identical to the tests but youll still need to look over the review to pass. Although he is constantly late and gets off topic, you can literally skip 70% of his class and STILL pass! Easy A!"
10312,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,2.0,4.0,"Fed Gov't Sumr '18; he's always late, slides are grammatically incorrect, slides have incomplete thoughts, the test reviews are multi - choice but hard to locate the correct answers because the answers are based on his opinions not actual book references or power points. It's strange but I've never had to spend so long searching answer."
10313,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT2306,5.0,3.0,"Funny professor and doesnt require attendance to pass. We have 60% of our class miss almost every period except test days and they still passed, the exams are available through blackboard and can be accessed and studied whenever. Super cool professor"
10314,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,4.0,1.0,"Took his class Fall '17, attendance isn't mandatory but it helps to show up to class for his lectures. He adds on more information than what he has on his powerpoints so take notes, it'll help on the reviews for each exam. Don't need the book so don't spend money. 3 exams and 1 final, super easy if you do your reviews."
10315,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"Mr. Jackson is one of the best professor's I've had. He is a little boring at times, but he knows his stuff. Three exams and a final. Show up for class and you'll get an easy A."
10316,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOVT2305,4.0,3.0,"This professor is a classic lecturer. He only gave 5 exams for grades, so if you study the reviews and the material you will do well."
10317,541609,Andrew,Jackson,Tarrant County College (all),History,GOV2305,5.0,1.0,His test questions are straight from the review. Didn't need to attend class to pass. Can google all the review questions online. But he is helpful with any questions you have. Also tries to make class entertaining and funny.
10319,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,2.0,"You definitely need to read and go to the lectures to be successful. If you go to lectures, participate, read, and study you should do good."
10320,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,1.0,5.0,"I did well, learnt loads. Won't go back bc of the anxiety watching classmates walk on eggshells. Top students feel comfortable but many classmates struggle for whatever reasons &amp; are treated with disdain - professors (of psych esp'y) should understand diversity of behaviours &amp; motivation amongst students. Not an active listener. 0 compassion."
10321,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,2.0,5.0,He is not it guys.
10322,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,1.0,4.0,You got to read to be able to pass the class. He will pick the ones who is quiet. If you don't know any answer to the question then he will be rude about it. I really don't recommend you to his class unless you are book smart. Not a lot of my classmate pass his quizes and their avg is 70. To be clear! HE IS RUUDEE! if i can i would rate him 0/5!!!
10323,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,4.0,"This class taught me a lot. Prof. Velarde will make you participate and engage in class. You are expected to read the textbook, you will fail without it. Prof. Velarde's lectures are amazing however you will need to put in the work to pass his class."
10324,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,3.0,"Brilliant and funny lecturer, every lecture is fun and really engages you in Psychology. Be prepared to read a lot, this isn't a class you can slack off in reading. He expects you to have read the content before the lecture. The quizzes are based on the textbook and exams are more lecture-based. If you read and come to class you will do great."
10325,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC1301,4.0,4.0,"I enjoyed his class, very passionate about Psych as well as ""outside of the box thinking. Have tough skin though because he is a bit blunt, calls people out, and his sense of humor is not for the faint of heart. Like some classes he had me feeling salty, but over all i loved the class and his lectures were so engaging, i plan on taking him again"
10326,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,5.0,4.0,"Mr. Jose Velarde is a pyschology gem! His class was very educational, fun, and interactive for me. He has good lectures that consist of videos, movies, and hands-on activities rather than just reading from a powerpoint. I will say, he has tests and quizzes often, so reading is the major key to passing his class. If you do the work, you'll be fine."
10327,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,4.0,2.0,He expects you to read before you get to lecture but still covers everything in great detail. He is able to keep students engaged and interested in class.
10328,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,4.0,3.0,"Pro. Velarde really gets a bad rep for no reason. His classes are engaging and make you actually think about the material you're learning. He's very dry and sarcastic and I think that's where he may rub people wrong, but it really didn't bother me as I am also dry and sarcastic. Just be ready to read on time, ask questions, and be active in class."
10329,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,5.0,3.0,"He's not particularly friendly so not everyone liked him. I guess he could be a little more approachable but he was fair and actually the lectures were great, if you really want to learn"
10330,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC1301,5.0,3.0,He often wants you to read chapters on your own time then he quizzes over it. Be sure to ask questions during lecture and take notes!
10331,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PYCH2301,1.0,5.0,I hope I can save atleast one person from taking him!!!! It was complete chaos. He abuses his power as a teacher. He would quite often pick on/bully the more quiet students. It was VERY uncomfortable to watch. Many of my classmates noticed this about him and agreed we didnt want to retake him. Do yourself a favor and pick any other professor.
10332,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2301,1.0,3.0,"Lectures aren't very helpful. If he tells you it's not important, IT IS! and it will be on the exam. quizzes are random so keep up on your reading. He says read 7 pages a day but they won't add up."
10333,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2302,5.0,4.0,The classes were hard work but prepare you for university study. You have to be prepared and responsible for yoyr own learni g which was hard at first but a lesson worth learning and he influenced my work ethic generally. Classes were engaging and he definitely knows his subject.
10334,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC1301,3.0,4.0,"I know all professors say you have to read to pass, but with Velarde, you HAVE TO READ!!! he will quiz over the chapter contents BEFORE he lectures, requiring you to read the chapter in advance. other than that, solid professor, really encourages deep discussion and a lot of class interaction. and he'll take the class outside on nice days."
10335,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYCH2316,2.0,3.0,"Puts emphasis on class discussion but can often be dismissive or passively disrespectful of students, discouraging said class discussion. Mr. V can be very disorganized - there is no solid syllabus, and he's failed to come to class without notice on more than one occasion. Take notes on the readings he assigns and you should make it out fine."
10336,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYC2319,1.0,3.0,"changes the due dates in the course calendar without posting an announcement or warning. a few times, when he did this, the assignment still closed at the old due date and could no longer access it. when i reached out to him, it took him a solid three weeks to respond to me and told me it was too late to make it up. very disappointing experience"
10337,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSYCH1301,1.0,4.0,"Its hard to understand some words bc of his accent. Tests are hard , his assignments were something else . Just do not take him . You basically have to teach yourself in order to pass"
10338,1105363,Jose,Velarde,Tarrant County College (all),Psychology,PSY2301,4.0,4.0,He is a great profesor knows how to teach and his classes are very fun. But he does make you read a lot and there are a lot of test. If you want a easy professor he is not the one for you.
10340,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST2311,1.0,5.0,"I'm accustomed to online learning and I study accordingly. Without assignments between tests, it's difficult to know what he finds most important, even with the outline. Also, each of the tests is based on 4 chapters of reading and it's just too much information to study effectively, especially considering how obscure some questions are."
10341,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST2311ONLINE,1.0,5.0,"Don't take him online. Only gives tests. 5 tests, he drops the lowest but I never made higher than a 75. Tests cover vague information that you wouldn't think is important, doesn't cover the important stuff. Lectures covered 10% of the material on the test, everything else is up to you to read. Shouldn't be a teacher. Again, don't take online."
10342,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST2312,1.0,5.0,"He was a decent person when I emailed about the textbook, but he was apparently very rude to the other students. His outlines barely pertain to his tests. I would study for a couple of days and still bomb the tests. You HAVE to read the textbook, and remember all the small details. This class was a summer course, and was extremely difficult."
10343,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,Hardest online class I have ever had to take. Assigns about 200 pages of reading and then comes the dreadful test! 50 questions in 50 minutes. I ended up dropping the class.
10344,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,2013FLHIST1301,1.0,5.0,"I took this class online. The tests are too hard. You are given a copy of the lecture notes, but maybe 20 out of 50 questions on the test are from the study guide. you must read the book. he will give you an outline to use. I would definitely recommend filling out the outline to study from. I will probably get a high C or low B. I get A's."
10345,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,4.0,He is a little boring but it's history soo...... 4 tests and a final (and he drops the lowest test grade) and everything on the test is mentioned in his lecture. people that fail this class are also the ones who never show up for class.
10346,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"DO. NOT. TAKE. Why didn't I read Rate my Professor BEFORE I took this course? I'm a great student, learned US Hist 1 very well, but nonetheless barely made a C.  Why? Well, missed two quizzes because the deadline was at 6:30 am in the MORNING!  Also, many test questions aren't in the  assigned material at all- so you must guess the answers."
10347,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,5.0,2.0,"I don't understand why everyone on here complains about him. He gives you an outline to follow while he lectures. Take good notes &amp; study your notes. If you do then you'll pass! His tests are easy. He's kind of a nerd. Beware of the ""In your professor's opinion"" questions. Don't be late though because he starts exactly on time."
10348,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST2312,1.0,4.0,"The entire course is based on exam grades. Exams that are only open for 1 day. I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, but don't most people take online classes for ease and accessibility? I prefer online because my busy lifestyle makes it difficult to be held down and confined to physically attending class. Shouldn't have to call into work for an exam."
10349,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,3.0,Dr. Story is a kind teacher who is interested in the success of his students.  Listen and take notes in class and make an appointment if you need extra help.
10350,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"Teacher will never communicate with you, until the day after you missed an assignment. Only to say that you missed the assignment not to offer you any chances. Online tests are usually due at random times like 0900 am instead of the usual 11:59pm like normal online classes. The test questions are poorly worded. You will fail this class."
10351,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,1.0,5.0,"Do not need book! Tests are difficult to study for because there will be questions with ""according to your professor's opinion..."" Test will be from lectures and those are hard to follow because he jumps around (chronologically) and follows rabbit trails. ONLY GOOD THING about him is that you will get your grades quickly.  DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!"
10352,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,3.0,4.0,"He's a nice guy but his lectures are hard to focus in because he literally just stands there and talks. His tests are pretty random, he gives you an outline for each unit but they're pretty vague. The online quizzes don't do much to your grade. He says to read the chapters but there are only like 3 questions about anything in the book on the tests."
10353,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST2312,1.0,5.0,"None of his tests come with any reviews.  None of his tests take any material from either the book or his notes.  Nothing is in any kind of order.  His deadline dates he gives you are due at 6 AM the morning of the day he gives you, so in reality, unless you are up before Six in the morning, they are due the night before.  "
10354,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1301,1.5,4.0,"He never sends out announcements.  His tests pull from his lecture notes... those notes look like he wrote them as fast as he could.  They're full of typos and a lot of it just doesn't seem relevant.  If your internet cuts out mid exam, the exam will submit automatically and you'll get a too bad so sad from him. "
10355,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,1301,2.0,5.0,"Unecessarily difficult course! Long and confusing oral lectures that DO NOT reflect what's on the tests. Extensive reading you have to memorize just about everything, he gives no reviews or study guides. Most of the class received a C or D and more than half ended up dropping! He tells you he will drop lowest test grade but never did so he lies too"
10356,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,1301,3.5,4.0,Pay attention to the lecture and take good notes off the lecture and the unit outline during the lecture and you will do good. I honestly didn't read at all and passed with a high B studying my lecture notes alone. Definitely would take again.
10357,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,1301,1.0,4.0,Very boring lectures. Tests seem to be much different than what he lectures on. Takes participation grade for going to class but otherwise you're better off just reading the book. The silver lining is half of final are exact questions from previous tests which he gives back to you. Can say I did learn some history but my grade did not reflect it.
10358,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HISTORY1301,1.0,5.0,Difficult class. Test are really hard even if you study. Gives a lot of unnecessary notes. He is a bit sassy when it comes to asking questions... overall its a challenging class. Good luck!
10359,179241,Larry,Story,Tarrant County College (all),History,HIST1302,1.0,5.0,Horrible
10361,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,"Loved this class! I honestly dont understand why there are so many negative reviews, he only has 4 tests and one final which is optional depending on your grade. His lectures are informative and his humor is contagious, by far one of the best professors I've had. Each test is 50 questions and you have 50 minutes to complete it, use the unit videos"
10362,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,1.0,1.0,"He requires you to use the book, but all the answers are outdated and not in the book. You will never hear from him. He didn't care about his online students. Stay away from this online professor."
10363,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,OMG I WOULD TAKE THIS ONLINE CLASS A MILLION TIMES!!!!!!!!!
10364,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HIST1302,5.0,2.0,"He doesn't really care if you show up to class or not or whether you're super late. But if you don't show up, you'll miss his lecture and you most likely won't pass the test. Show up to class, take good notes, enjoy all his corny puns, study for the test and you'll pass the class easily!"
10365,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,4.0,4.0,I took this class online 2019 Maymester (fast! pay attention to due dates!). The class was fairly easy as long as you do the study guide. of course everything on the study guide is not going to be on the test. I did make a D on the class but that is because I missed one of the tests and I did not do the study guide for another test.
10366,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,5.0,2.0,4 test final is optional just do the study guide. Funny class was never boring learned a lot.
10367,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,1.0,4.0,I took this class online &amp; never had any feedback from him other than to inform of an upcoming test. There are 4 exams &amp; an optional final. The test are timed 50 min/50 questions. Most of the study guide material will not be on the test so don't bother. I hated this class!
10368,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,3.0,3.0,"I took his online course. Never heard from him. Did the tests, made an A, and moved on. Nothing bad to say about him, but nothing good to say either. That's what I gave him the most neutral review possible."
10369,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,4 tests and 1 optional final exam; 2 extra credit assignments that aren't worth doing at 5 points each unless you think that you are going to be close to a higher grade. Great class though and I learned quite a bit by just reading the book.
10370,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,5.0,2.0,"he funny and makes government not so bad. he does a quick like 5 question quiz before every class. tests arent that hard and most of the quiz questions are on the test so you should already know the answers because he goes over the quizzes. Fun class, and im taking him again"
10371,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,4.0,2.0,"Nice guy, prefers to go by Brian, really funny.   Test are pretty easy, and he drops the lowest one. Make sure you study for the quizzes"
10372,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,4.0,3.0,"I took him for spring semester GOVT 2305, I loved his lectures truly amazing professor!! You only take 4 exams and write short essays which are pretty easy! His lectures are interesting never boring!"
10373,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,5.0,1.0,gives you the reviews if you do them you should get an easy A. all questions from the quizzes are on the test so it makes it easier. 4 test and 1 final-if you have an A you do not have to take it. He is really funny and passionate. I always look forward to his class and its never boring!
10374,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,3.0,3.0,"Good instruction, only 4 exams, watch questions/answers, some questions haven't been updated so answer may not be located in the textbook or the answers provided are wrong.  Overall, good study material provided and lowest of 5 grades dropped."
10375,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,5.0,1.0,"Hilarious, rational, energetic. Makes lectures engaging. Wish i could take him for every course. 4 tests w/ essay &amp; a optional final. Quizzes weekly.  Good: provides clear study guides for each test &amp; quiz, lots of easy quizzes to buffer grades, extra credit on tests. Study a little and get an A Bad: no clear schedule posted for semester."
10376,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2305,5.0,3.0,"He was my favorite teacher this semester! he's very funny and tries to work with each student, all the students liked him so I highly recommend him. : )"
10377,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,4.0,2.0,Took 2306 Online. With that said I took Brian Johnson in person for 1301. He is a fantastic teacher in person but is very hands off online. Received 2 emails total over the course of the semester. Course is clear cut though 1 quiz a week and a test after every 3 chapters. Drops lowest test and 2 lowest quizzes. Easy A but very dull.
10378,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,2.0,4.0,"Do not take him online. He gives one quiz a week then every four weeks a test, sounds easy right? No, he has a time limit on everything I can barely find the answers to any of his test/quizzes. Another thing, he doesn't open anything up till Friday morning and its due Saturday night, which sucks for people who have jobs. Don't take this guy online."
10379,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,GOVT2306,3.5,2.0,"Do not take this professor for an online class. He doesn't update his tests, so some questions weren't covered in the book and the automatic grading is off so I spent a lot of time e-mailing him to correct grades. The book is openly biased, so don't expect a balanced view of politics, but if you're liberal leaning, you'll like it."
10380,728135,Brian,Johnson,Tarrant County College (all),Social Sciences,HIST1301,2.5,5.0,This class is great if you enjoy writing long essays for every test. He provides you with a study guide that could be helpful if completed with the correct answers. Very tough grader. You must pay attention in class and take notes. Drops lowest test grade but does not give extra credit. Would not recommend if trying to find an easy professor.
10382,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,I do not know where to even begin! This professor is the best one you will have. She gives out about 120 points of extra credit and her assignments are very easy. Her assignments will help you and you will get so much out of them. She really cares about her students and you can tell she loves her job. I cannot recommend her enough!
10383,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,1.0,"Professor Brooker deeply cares about what you get out of this class. Not only is she an amazing professor, her class really helps to solidify your plan in life. You do need to be sure to submit things by the due dates, but she typically gives you a week to complete it. It is not a hard class, but be ready to be open and figure out your life!"
10384,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,Professor Brooker really cares and loves her job. Her assignments really help you figure out your path and can be insightful. She's also pretty funny and plays lo-fi music before class starts.
10385,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,Professor Brooker really cares about her students and the class is pretty fun. You will make new friends for sure.
10386,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,BEST TEACHER AT VALENCIA!!! I had such an amazing time in Professor Brooker's class. She does a lot of things as a group and her projects are very beneficial. She has very clear cut instructions for each assignment and helps you in any way she can. Very chill class all around but must show up to understand the material and in order to pass.
10387,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,"Professor Brooker is hands down, the most caring and genuine professor I've ever had. She truly cares, for each and every one of her students. The class is extremely easy, as long as you do your work. Tons of extra credit as well. For new college students who are still trying to figure out their college career, this professor is extremely helpful"
10388,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,"While this class did involve some assignments that required a lot of work, majority of it was very beneficial, especially if it's your first year in college and everything is new. Professor Brooker is very caring and makes class fun. As long as you turn in your assignments, it'll be an easy A"
10389,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,4.0,2.0,"Easy. I took Prof. Brooker for New Student experience, and although the class was a little pointless for me, it isn't hard to get an A in. All you have to do is follow the directions, and be at least a little genuine. She has assignments that make you think really inward, but I found there wasn't really enough time for that depth. Lots of EC too."
10390,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,Hands down the best teacher I have ever had. She is super patient and cares about every student she has and will do anything she can to help you succeed. I learned more about myself in this class than I have in a longer period of time. She is super out going and will make you feel very comfortable. If theres one teacher id take again its her.
10391,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,4.0,2.0,LOVE her and this class sooo much!! If you can get into her class before it fills DO IT!!!!
10392,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,4.0,Great professor for NSE I would recommend taking her at Valencia.
10393,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,Hands down one of the best teachers Ive ever had. She really cares about her students and does a great job creating a comfortable atmosphere. The class is super easy as all you have to do is follow directions and do your work on time and you should have an easy A. 10/10 would recommend this class and Professor Brooker.
10394,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,2.0,"Professor Brooker is hands down the best teacher you will take at Valencia. She is so insightful and is not afraid to tell you the truth. The class is kind of dumb not gonna lie, but she makes it fun. I did a mixed mode course and I wish I would've taken her normal classes they were a lot of fun, and you meet new people and learn so much."
10395,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,3.0,4.0,"Shes a nice professor, gives feedback after turning in your assignment. Gives so much work for such a dumb class its crazy, grades quick and is picky but to an extent. Just make sure you do all the work and youll do just fine."
10396,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,3.0,This class wouldve been a complete joke but professor Brooker makes it completely relatable and funny. This course does have a lot of homework but if you do it you will get an A.
10397,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,1.0,2.0,She is an okay teacher. The only thing is this class a stupid class that is required to take so I don't understand why she would give out SO MUCH HOMEWORK. It's like she wanted to make it hard because it was a stupid required class. Anyways. I got had an A+ the whole time so do the homework and your fine. Just annoying how much homework.
10398,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,1.0,Shes overall great!
10399,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,4.0,"Professor Brooker is very caring about our work and that we succeed in class as well as life. She wants us to have the tools and knowledge we need. She is accessible and understanding of many things. Often knows before I do, what it is I need to look for. She is kind and gives good feedback."
10400,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,4.0,2.0,"By participation matters, what I mean is thats one of her main focuses. She wants you to engage. She is passionate of what she does n that you have a take away for each lesson."
10401,1918687,Kaitlyn,Brooker,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,4.0,4.0,She is good but sometimes takes thngs too seriously for a class that is just about college life.
10403,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1017,5.0,2.0,"Hands down the best professor I've had at Valencia. I took his class at the downtown campus when it first opened. I am NOT a fan of talking in front of groups but he takes the time to let everyone get to know each other and feel comfortable. Not only did I learn so much in this course, but he genuinely cares about his students. I miss his class!"
10404,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,I am not a fan of public speech but I genuinely enjoyed this class. He is strict with deadlines but its set up fairly easy and leads you onto the next assignment. There are 4 speeches total in the course. He accommodates for different schedules having his zoom calls held at two different times and is clear on his expectations.
10405,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,4.0,3.0,Best online speech course. Deadlines are always Wednesday and Sunday. So easy to follow - you never miss a deadline. Course was fun. He helps you a lot. Responds to messages so fast!! You must take him!
10406,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,I thought online would be hard BUT his class is so easy to follow. The directions are so clear so you just need to follow them and you do well. He answers questions superfast and grades fast too!! He really want to help you do well so listen to his tips. Fun class and it is online!
10407,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,4.0,3.0,He worked with me and the students. The course had speeches - not too many but you get to pick cool topics. Due dates were very clear and you knew what was expected. He is a cool guy and really was nice. I would tell my friends to take him.
10408,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,"I put this course off until the end. I had some bad experiences and was told to take Professor Moniz from a friend. I am so glad I did!! He helped me so much. The course is very easy to follow online. You read the directions, rubrics and assignments. He has calls to help you and he made them fun. I am so glad I took the course."
10409,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,Taking his class was more than I thought it would be. Just make sure you follow the directions. He makes it so easy to do well but you got to follow the directions. He will make you laugh and does a good job making the class really cool.
10410,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,I saw him speak at an event and I had to take him. He was so good and fair. The course work was good and it was easy to follow. The had a good time in the class. He made me laugh. He really would help when I have problems. He gives you feedback and grades FAST. I like that. My friends are taking him next. Great guy!
10411,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,I wanted to take him in person but COVID kept it to online. He does a nice job of helping us but giving you space too. I have learned a lot. He always gives feedback and emails responses FAST. He will spend the time to help you. He makes it fun and easy. Make sure you make the deadlines.
10412,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,I have never taken an online class. His class is much more organized and clear on what is asked of you. I was worried about one of the speeches - he spent an hour helping me. Online is weird because you have to do it alone but he makes it better. I also enjoy the assignment topics.
10413,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,I was working on my outline and needed help. He was so responsive which is rare for online. The class is very clear and you just need to follow the directions to do well. I appreciate someone who helps you and wants you to succeed. I wish I could take him in person.
10414,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,"I was so scared with Covid and the course went online and didn't know what to do! My friend said to take him because he will help you! I am so glad I did. We are only a few weeks in but the course is fun, so organized and very clear what is expected. He is so much fun and keeps us going through this. He always is helping you!"
10415,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,I am taking him online and love him!! He is very clear on what you need to do. He has a very organized class and clear expectations. He has been so helpful! You need to be accountable but he did so much to help me! Take his course. Just don't lie. LOL
10416,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,His class is awesome! He is so funny ! He is very clear with the things he want ! He helped me to be more confident in myself. His class was my favorite of the semester we had such a great time . Unfortunately coronavirus didnt let us continue with this journey !
10417,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,2.0,"Amazing professor! Gives you a very clear outline of what he expects from you! He is very creative and open, class would go by so fast because he made it very enjoyable. I didn't get an 'A' because I never made time (So practice making time). He gave about five speeches which he gave enough time to prepare for. One speech was a group speech."
10418,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,"I really like the class and Michael. He was fun, clear and worked hard to help. You just need to take the class seriously, follow directions and you will do fine. I learned so much I can use in my life and other classes."
10419,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,Come to class to have fun. It was a nice class with a caring professor. Michael makes things exciting each class so get ready. Speeches are not bad and he has clear guidelines which makes it easy. Just do your work and you are fine.
10420,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,We had to go online for the end and I so missed the class. It was my favorite. Can you believe it? You give speeches but he makes it so much fun. He is funny and spends a lot of time to help you. The class is very organized which I liked. Take his course. I MISS HIS ENERGY!
10421,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,I loved his class and I learned a lot. He is so much fun and really takes the time to work with you. He is always kind. I would have done so well but I didn't listen to him about texting so that impacted me. Don't be like me - make your friends wait! The class is worth it! He is worth it!!
10422,1919054,Michael,Moniz,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Speech,SPEECH1,5.0,3.0,"He is the BEST. It's going to be a little awkward for the first couple classes because he will ask you to do somethings that you probably never did before. But after that, you will get used to it and everything will be much much much better. It's fun!"
10424,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BCC1010C,2.0,5.0,This teacher is very very unorganized I say this because you will think one week you will have no assignment and then you will have an assignment that is due tomorrow . Another thing is that if everything is not right on any of your assignments you get a zero. He's a great guy but a confusing grader and very harsh when he comes to grading as well.
10425,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BIO1010C,1.0,5.0,Grades very harshly and if you want to pass you will have to read minds because he has a very specific way that you have to write your own notes that he grades without telling you how to write them. Get one thing slightly wrong or forget to mention a word that he didn't even mention himself you will get a 0. You have to teach yourself.
10426,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BCC1010,1.0,5.0,One of the worst professors you will ever have. If you get one step wrong on any problem you get a 0 and nothing in between. The only way to pass this class is if you 1. Don't have a job. 2. Go to every help session from his 4 student tutors. 3. Find religion and pray to god. This is your last warning. DO NOT CLICK ON ADD JIM BELCHERS CLASS.
10427,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,1010C,1.0,4.0,"3/4s of the class, along with myself have dropped this class this semester. You have to teach yourself everything based off of whatever he decides to speak on that day since we do not follow a text book. Impossible grader, very rare for any one in the class to get even a B on the daily pop quizzes. A nice man but an unacceptable professor."
10428,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BIO1010C,5.0,4.0,"Professor Jim Belcher is the nicest, most passionate professor I have had at Valencia. He really knows and cares about what he is talking about. He gave us his phone number and I was able to text him literally any time of day or night with questions regarding the homework, material, anything. If you pay attention, you will understand and even enjoy"
10429,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,1010C,1.0,5.0,"This is the worst profesor Ive ever taken. DO NOT take him If you have other options. He gives a quiz out every day and is a very tough grader. Also he doesn't give any sort of notes and barely even lectures. In addition to all of this he says he wants to switch the seat of authority so, if you do not do good teaching yourself DONT TAKE THE COURSE"
10430,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BSC1010C,1.0,4.0,"Run, dont walk away! Horrible teaching style. Horrible grading style. Creates lots of unnecessary stress and anxiety! Worst class ever."
10431,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BIO1010C,3.0,4.0,"I hated him the first weeks of class. He takes points off everything if its not exactly how he wants it. You cant use THEY, IT, or THIS or its points off. BUT he let you recover. He leaves homework that barely checks but still do them! There are quizzes everyday! No lab practical. At the end I enjoyed the class so work hard and you will pass!"
10432,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BCC1010,1.0,5.0,Awful class. You have to learn on your own. He makes stuff up on the spot. Within the first half of the semester more than half the class dropped. If youre thinking of taking this Professor do not. Hes a nice person but a horrible professor.
10433,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BSC1010C,3.0,5.0,"Super chill professor but is very tough when it comes to grading. The grade is based on quizzes, packets, and some labs. He allows you to recover points but the class is really difficult overall. You also will have to teach yourself or go to tutoring sessions."
10434,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BSC1010C,5.0,4.0,Jim is a great professor! He assigns a lot of hard and time consuming work but if you are going into biomedical sciences or anything health related TAKE HIM. He gave me all the basics I needed to Ace my anatomy and micro courses! He goes really in depth with everything so if you are passionate about biology you should take this professor
10435,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,EVR1001,2.0,1.0,So... the entire time I was wondering if I was actually in an environmental class or not. It felt more like a walmart-brand philosophy class. If you're looking for an easy A and don't mind not learning anything about the environment but more about your feelings/emotions then I'd say take it. He means well but I felt like I was in therapy.
10436,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BCC1010,2.0,4.0,"He doesn't teacher you, almost all the work is given without telling you. He told the class on the first day that you have to teach yourself, he gives mini lectures that leavez you lost. He gives quizzes almost everyday, and grades them harshly on information that he barely covers in class. If you take him good luck, He can be funny at least."
10437,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BCC1010,5.0,4.0,"If you are a lazy person, dont take the course. Its not his fault that some students pass, its the fact that students dont like to work or do hw. He outlines at the beginning what the class is like. I asked questions, did hw and studied, and ended with an A"
10438,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BIO1010C,5.0,4.0,"Best bio professor at Valencia. If you are major in bio, please do yourself a favor and take him. You will truly learn bio! He is a very picky professor. Study hard and you will be amazed!"
10439,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BIO1010C,5.0,4.0,"He is an amazing professor I ever had. This class is hard buy I learned so much for him. He will there when you need help. He loves what his doing and he is very good at it. If you want to learning take him, if you want a easy A, it is not happening if you are not working hard. I'm very grateful had him as my professor."
10440,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BSC1010C,5.0,4.0,Jim is not like the normal professor where memorizing a textbook will help you pass the class. He really is there for the students to learn and grow in a better way than just memorization. His teaching style will help you in the long run (although may be frustrating at times) and if you put in the time to learn youll do great.
10441,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,EVR1001,5.0,2.0,"Professor Belcher is a good Professor. I learned a lot in this class. He makes you understand each chapter in a different way. Like videos, individual projects or groups projects. He sends a lot of assignments ( too much), but there is not test. His class is based on Homework and participation.  Easy A, if you do what the syllabus says."
10442,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,BIO1010C,1.0,4.0,"Jim isn't a bad person, he is just a bad instructor. He doesn't teach the material well, nor does he use to textbook so studying is difficult then he expects paragraphs of information on written quizzes that he gives every week. It's supposed to be an introductory class but feels like a higher leveling course where you teach yourself."
10443,210707,Jim,Belcher,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Science,1010C,1.0,4.0,"If you are a structured style learner with terms and definitions, this is most definitely NOT the professor. He specifically said din the beginning of the semester, I do not teach you, you teach yourselves."
10445,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1012,4.0,3.0,"Overall, a really nice professor. She doesn't seem to have a lot of involvement though since most of the class (online) is done through an online textbook program. All tests are multiple choice and so they are automatically graded. Answered emails and questions promptly and was helpful. Even rounded up my grade by half a point so I got an A."
10446,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,CLP2140,5.0,2.0,Prof. Addelston is super chill and funny. All the tests are group tests except for the final. She has cool real-life examples due to her being a family/marriage counselor. The content is interesting and she explains things thoroughly without boring the class! I'm taking another psych class with her next semester!
10447,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,1.0,Took PSY 2012 online with Professor Addelston. SO EASY! she grades fairy. For the discussion post make sure you write paragraphs for your initial post. Tests are all online you have 70 minutes to complete 50 questions. Homework is time consuming but you keep re-trying until you get them all right. She responds to emails fasts!
10448,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,3.0,"I love her! She's by far one of the best teachers I have ever had. She's super funny, super fair and super helpful! This is my second time taking her class because I did not trust any other teacher after having her for gen. psych. All tests but final are taken in groups, and homework due every few weeks. She inspired me to be a psychologist."
10449,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,2.0,"Professor Addelston is a great professor. You learn a lot in her class and the assignments are not that difficult. The assignments are very long though, so prepare to spend some time completing the weekly assignments. Besides that, I believe that her class is a great choice and I highly recommend it."
10450,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,2.0,Took online. Decent class but didnt learn much. Learnsmart hw &amp; discussions due every week. I found a way to do the HW for the semester ahead of time but she wouldn't open discussions until week of which is annoying for an online class. Tests taken at home open book &amp; pretty easy. Easy A but not interesting class for online format.
10451,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"She's the best psychology teacher ever. You'll actually learn a lot form her. Her exams are in groups or 2 but the final is alone/cumulative. I took her 8:30am class and i didn't care how early it was, it was so fun. She's really funny too. Take her!"
10452,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,I took her beginning PSY class online. She was fair with her grades. I submitted assignments where I didn't give my full effort and she graded them appropriately. I'm going to seek her out and take a class with her in the classroom. I highly recommend her!!
10453,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,COS126,5.0,1.0,"It was like my birthday in this class everytime, all the tests except for the final you can take with a group no more than 3, HW is just modules with a bunch of questions on the chapter (you can just look it up on quizlet) overall it was like Christmas."
10454,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"I took this class online as a flex start class, and she was a breeze! There was minimal work ethic needed. As long as you did the discussions, online homework, and the tests then you can get an A! My ONLY issue was that the homework assignments contained 60-90 questions, which is a lot to do in 1-1/2 weeks when you are taking 4 other classes."
10455,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2004,4.0,3.0,"Homework is on connect (online) no physical textbook. Do all the homework, and when its time for tests go over the homework of the chapters for the tests like twice at least. The tests may be taken in groups of three except for the final. Also if you can do the extra credit do it, I didn't do any, so had to study hard for final."
10456,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,CLP2140,5.0,3.0,"I wake up excited to be apart of her class. You feel important, your voice and thoughts matter, the whole class engages, and overall shes the best professor Ive ever had. Ive taken her for 4 psych courses and loved every single one of them. I go to UCF next semester and Id be lying if I said my heart didnt break a lil when I had to leave her."
10457,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,CLP2140,4.0,1.0,"Great professor, just learnsmars as homework all due the same day of the exam. Plus extra creditttt ALOT ! Too easy; even the exams are group taken."
10458,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,3.0,Dr. Addelston is hilarious and super sarcastic. She makes her lectures/powerpoints interesting. Homework is all learnsmart assignments. Lets you take exams in groups of 2 or 3. Also gave many extra credit opportunities. Attendance is important and also does not allow cellphone usage in class. Would take again!
10459,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,SOP2332,5.0,4.0,"She is amazing in her field. Though she teaches a tough subject, she makes everything easy to understand and is there to answer all questions. She does assign a few APA papers along with some question heavy learnsmarts but lets you take her tests in groups of three or less! She is NOT a tough grader so just put in the work and you will pass!"
10460,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,4.0,2.0,Did not try to reach out to her but she was a quick grader and actively checked up on the class progress.  It was enjoyable but lots and lots of reading.
10461,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,4.0,3.0,"It's online class so mostly ran by learnsmart and little instructor interaction, but the discussions were cool - while they did challenge your book knowledge, they did give you an opportunity to present your personal opinion which kept it interesting. Graded quickly - be prepared to read, class is harder/faster paced then gen psych"
10462,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,SOP2332,3.0,1.0,She was a good teacher in the beginning but then started to slack off at the end. She puts discussions up at the last minute and gives you a zero if you don't do them. I haven't seen the discussion post up and the next day I will get a zero. I can't do a discussion post if I don't see it. Don't take her!!!
10463,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,1.0,"The subject is hard but, she is great explaining."
10464,82118,Judith,Addelston,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,1.0,If I could write more that 350 to describe her it would be great! She is so passionate about her career and her students. Her lectures are amazing ! When you go and take the test you remember what she said in the lecture. Her test in groups (if you want to )and she drops her lowest test grade! She inspired change my major to psychology.
10466,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001,3.0,4.0,"She is TOUGH! She will tear your writing to shreds and ask you to put it back together in the way she likes. But what she lacks in allowing creative expression and exploration she makes up for in advice and SUPER easy quizzes. Although I personally wasn't the biggest fan of the course, I would definitely recommend her. Tough but worth it!"
10467,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,4.0,You will learn a lot. Professor Orsini is very clear in her expectations. Pay attention in class and take her serious and you will pass with a good Grade and Better understanding of the necessary skills to properly write more clear and effective in your future classes and career.
10468,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,5.0,"Professor Orsini is very knowledgeable and caring. She sets the right expectations from the beginning. I took her twice, her classes were very difficult but I learned a great deal from her. I am currently pursuing my English major at UCF and everything that she taught me has helped me to be a superb student. If you are a writer, you need her!"
10469,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001,1.0,5.0,Worst professor ever. Her assignments are 40 pages long and super hard to understand. Her expectations are beyond high. She seems nice but I just think that its a lot for a class that is an elective. Her quizzes and test are very hard as well! If you are looking for a simple elective/fun elective to take this is not it. Take someone else!
10470,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,4.0,4.0,Professor Orsini has such a vibrant personality and always has a crazy story or useful fact ready tell. I actually felt like I learnt how to be a better writer in her class but she can be a strict grader so watch out and go to the writing center a lot.
10471,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001,5.0,4.0,"If you are serious about improving your writing, you want Professor Orsini. Her critiques are brutally honest but positive. She will always tell you what you're doing right as well as point out where you need to improve. Her critiques were integral to my getting published for the first time."
10472,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001,2.0,4.0,"she does know what she's talking about and I'm sure she could help improve your writing, if she ever graded anything. She doesn't keep to her word about grading assignments and keeping our grades up to date. we posted a total of 3 pieces and and she hasn't graded any of them."
10473,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,4.0,2.0,"I took professor Orsini for freshman comp 2 in the spring , and can say she is amazing. She was organized and had a schedule that will not make you stress. Only a few quizzes online that are easy to get 100 and 2 papers. Professor Orsini has a schedule for the essay so it was finished in a breeze. Also lots of extra credit!!"
10474,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001,5.0,3.0,"If you want someone to coddle you, do not take her. If you want to become a better writer and can accept critique, TAKE THIS CLASS. By far the most helpful writing professor I've had. She will tell you clearly what does and doesn't work in your writing. She will encourage you and support you while telling you what you need to work on."
10475,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,She was the worst professor I have ever had! She is the toughest grader I ever had . Her instructions are very complex and on a higher level than an average dual enrollment / college student can understand . Dont take unless u r prepared to be stressed and confused a lot .
10476,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001ONLINE,4.0,4.0,"I loved Professor Orsini this semester, she was awesome, a really genuine person, and provided me with some great feedback I really tried to use in my work. The class structure is great and keeps me into the material in the blog posts. Although she grades really really tough, her amazing feedback and wisdom make up for it."
10477,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001ONLINE,5.0,2.0,"This course was amazing and I recommend any aspiring writers to try it out! Professor Orsini gives great feedback and grades more than fairly. This course expanded my comfort with several genres of writing and once again, I highly recommend taking this course with Orsini!"
10478,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,5.0,I took Professor Orsini for freshman Comp I and II. Her teaching skill are both challenging and enlighting. She is a tough grader but you learn for sure! I am so grateful for her! I would have love to have her for my advance classes.
10479,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,4.0,"She made English fun. The moment that changed my life forever was when I told her I was math-science minded. She said, ""That doesn't matter. The same part of your brain is used for both math-science and English. You can do this."" She'll make you earn your grade, she'll tell you exactly how to improve, and she'll make it fun along the way."
10480,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2001ONLINE,5.0,3.0,This class consisted of a few writing assignments and some quizzes based on reading from the textbook. Professor was very quick to answer emails and very friendly and helpful. Easy A from an DE student. Take the class seriously and you will do just fine. She is a fair grader. Would take her for another writing class if I had the chance.
10481,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,"I loved this class so much! Learned more about writing during this semester than I have in my entire 4 years of high school. Ms. Orsini motivated me to enjoy writing and she gives great feedback. Like she says, ""it takes a special kind of idiot to do it well,"" so get ready to work. Take the class. You will not regret it."
10482,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2100,1.0,5.0,"I took Professor Orsini's Intro to Fiction course online this semester. I did all of the reading, completed all of the assignments, and wrote my heart out. I put more effort into this class than the rest of my classes combined, and still did not receive an A. This is coming from a straight-A student. Get ready to work and have your work be judged."
10483,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2100,4.0,4.0,I can't imagine there being a class where I could've learned more about writing than this one. You really develop a solid grasp on what good and bad writing looks like. I'd recommend this for anyone who has a genuine interest in storytelling. I think some of the reviews on here are a little harsh. She's VERY fair and pretty cool if you ask me.
10484,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,5.0,4.0,She gives a lot of work but she makes sure you always know what you're doing. Her lectures were enjoyable and I recommend talking to her after class if you have any questions about the work. She's a tough grader but if you work hard it pays off and her feed back will help you become a better writer if you actually take it.
10485,243562,Diane,Orsini,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,CRW2102,5.0,4.0,"Professor Orsini is one of the best professors. She cares so much. Her critiques are honest (she doesn't sugar coat), but you will learn so much from her. She makes time to understand/ help her students. She wants everyone to succeed. Take this professor if you want a career as a writer-- you will not regret it!"
10487,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,3.0,"Almost all test are take home, dont let him trick you with the first test, he pranks you. Honestly he is not a bad guy, he is just insanely sarcastic and talks way to much. If you take him for a 3 hour class good luck. He moves so slow and you dont understand him, asks a question and he makes you feel stupid. If u have no choice, just take em."
10488,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,1.0,"Very cool guy, laid back and funny. Although, his lectures can be long and boring if you're already good at math. Super easy course load, his classes were lectures and homework was all online. Gives extra credit very often. Strict test grader. He's very intelligent and knows what he's talking about so don't try to argue about things!"
10489,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,1.0,First time Ive taken math in years and was very nervous but his lectures were broken down so well and made so easy to understand. Hes extremely patient and very respectable. Plenty of extra credit was given and the homework is fairly manageable. Did not require textbook itself. Highly recommend for anyone taking College Mathematics.
10490,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"You have to do the assignments and tests online, take notes and attend class and his lectures in order to pass. He allows re-takes for his online exams. He is willing to explain things very smoothly and makes his syllabus very clear. Overall, a very well respected professor who knows his job and what he's teaching to his students."
10491,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"Professor Whittlesey is excellent. He explains clearly what is going to be on the assessments and homework, and really does a great job outlining his grading criteria. He isn't the best at returning emails, but he is a great professor that cares about his students and makes math really easy to understand."
10492,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT0024,5.0,1.0,The best math prof! Explains material so it is to be understood very easily. Only talks about relevant things. Sometimes says a funny joke. Homework is acceptable amount. Most test were take home. He will prepare you for everything on chapter tests as well as the finals. Gives room for extra credit points.
10493,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT0020,4.0,3.0,"He's not very conversational, and he mostly just lectures. He teaches pretty well, and allows you take tests home. I passed his class so he's pretty good."
10494,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Whittlesey allows you to take test homes. HW isnt an Excessive amount, code needed. He carefully explains the material so that its clearly understood. There is no Midterm and the final is divided in 2 parts. He gives a study guide for the final. Extra credit is available. He gives you the tools to succeed. Easy class if you put in the work."
10495,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,3.0,Really awesome professor who cares about his students. He loves to help his students but you have to put it in the work and effort. Would love to take him as a professor again.
10496,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,3.0,"Prof Whittlesey is an amazing math teacher, honestly one of the best I've ever had in all of my schooling. He teaches everything step by step and uses different colors to denote different steps in solving a problem. If you come to class and pay attention you'll pass with no problem. If you're lazy and don't bother showing up, you have no chance."
10497,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MGF1106,5.0,1.0,Highly recommend. He teaches step-by-step so little room for confusion. Attendance is mandatory. Online homework (MyMathLab) allows several attempts with practice questions. Tests are take home and/or online. He goes over what appears on the finals. Showing work on tests is very important!! Extra credit opportunities. No book needed.
10498,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MGF1106,4.0,2.0,I have never been good at math but he broke things down into a simple form that I was able to comprehend. The online homework is easy and it is such a useful tool. Professor W and the online portion go very well with each other. I love that he has a system for missing class-3 free passes. He is very organized and I appreciate his use of colors.
10499,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,4.0,"While I passed the class and learned a lot, his teaching style wasn't for me. Although I personally won't take him again, I do recommend his class if you are a visual learner as he gives multiple examples and works out homework problems for you. The tests are all take home; take this seriously!! Learn the material for the final as that test is not."
10500,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Mr. W is great! I'm an older student who doesn't have lots of extra time. I appreciate his teaching style, use of colors, and many examples of how to do problems. He's a tough, but fair test grader and the tests are take home. He even loaned me the book because I didn't have financial aid. I failed with a different prof but not with him!"
10501,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,4.0,"Prof. Whittlesey wants his students to pass his class. All his tests are take home so you literally have the ability to use any resource around you to get a 100% on the teat but you have to work for it. Come exam time, he wants you to prove that you know how to do the work, given his tests were take home. Overall pretty straight forward class!"
10502,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MGF1106,4.0,3.0,Professor Whittlesey is great professor. All tests are take home expect the final. If you pay attention in class you should be able to pass. I've taken math 3 times prior to this class and failed. This class made me feel confident in maths. Professor Whittlesey is funny and is a great teacher.
10503,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,4.0,"He may come off as abrasive but he teaches so that you learn the material. If you are lazy and not willing to put in work, then he is not for you. All tests are take home except the final. If you just cheat on the tests you have no chance. The final is 30%, is in two parts, and you must score at least a 50% on it to pass the class."
10504,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"He is a great professor! I took him for College Algebra, he works at a steady pace and makes sure everyone understands what they are doing. All tests are take home and he gives lots of opportunity for bonus points. 10/10 recommend taking him for as many classes as you can!!"
10505,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"I loved having Professor Whittlesey for College Algebra. I took his class while still duel enrolled in HS (while taking 8 other classes), and he made this class a breeze; and I suck at math. All tests are take home except for the final and homework is online. Half off all test had an online portion where you're allowed several attempts. Easy A!"
10506,302091,Dave,Whittlesey,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,3.0,"I took Professor Whittlesey's college algebra class during summer term. He's very sarcastic and very frank with students, which can come off as being rude. Because of this, I pwe sonally, I didn't feel comfortable asking questions in class. Homework as well as chapter test are online. The final exam is in class, which he gives a study guide for."
10508,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,4.0,Its a lot of work however she will make everything clear to you and to be prepared for the exams. Be ready to have enough time for diet analysis. Isnt hard work but take a lot of time! There are 4 exams and a FINAL. All of them are truth proctoring! It is hard but this will make you to learn the material not just for a grade but for life. A
10509,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,2.0,4.0,"This professor did not reply to my emails, and the exams felt like nothing from the book. There was no lecture, I think i could've found somebody better. The only thing i really liked was the extra credit she gave us at the end."
10510,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,2.0,"Take this course from this professor because you would learn a lot about nutrition, especially about checking the nutrition label in food boxes. This course is extremely useful for our own health and for future patients when we do become nurses."
10511,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,3.0,"In this course, there is video assignments that you have to log in to complete, which is required for a grade. Another thing that promoted my learning and engagement is the big project that involve Sam or Sally, which I find very educational and interesting to do."
10512,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,2.0,4.0,Never posted any lectures just told you to read the chapters. I emailed her multiple times are she doesn't use full sentences so it was hard to understand her. If you miss even one part of a question she takes off over half the points. Take someone else if you want to get a good grade.
10513,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,3.0,One of the best Profesor at Valencia. She e-mails fast! . Anytime U had problem she was quick to respond. Take her you will not regret!
10514,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,1.0,4.0,"Rude and demeaning. Tests are 7-10 chapters with no study guides and no PowerPoints. No constructive feedback. She contradicts her own instructions. Find another professor, promise you dont want to take her."
10515,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,3.0,"This class is very educational. It comprises of over 20 chapters, 3 tests, and a cumulative final. You will need to study hard, however, if you do all the assignments and put the work in you will succeed with Prof Rao. You will learn a lot and it will help you out if you are going for nursing. Thank you, professor! Take this class!"
10516,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,1.0,5.0,"This professor is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. All her assignment instructions are unclear, she responds very rudely in emails, and the amount of grammar errors is ridiculous. You better not get sick or have any emergencies come up because she is not even a little bit understanding. Her test are 50 min. to complete 50 questions."
10517,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,2.0,4.0,"In my experience during this class, I felt like the class setup was slightly disorganized. Many assignments have grammar mistakes and are unclear on what she wants out of the assignment. The class was reasonably easily besides diet analysis 3, which I felt was a nightmare."
10518,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,1.0,5.0,"This is one of the most unorganized classes I have ever read. There are always grammatical error in the directions and ever her instructions contradict themselves. Not even that, her tests are not fair because they are super hard and you get no study guide and everything is timed. Tests are about 8 chapters each. Also her critique is very rude."
10519,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,3.0,4.0,"GET READY TO READ A LOT. Given that you only have 13 weeks to get through 23 chapters, this class is fast paced. Mamta gives great feedback and is willing to help. However, there are A LOT of typos on almost every document she gives you, which is very annoying. Be ready to give PARAGRAPHS for responses in activities. Try to take this class alone."
10520,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,2.0,Loved the you tube that was posted. You can sail through this class if you put some effort
10521,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,3.0,"super class, very interactive. its not hard also not easy. great for nursing"
10522,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,1.0,3.0,"She is disorganized &amp; extremely picky. Her instructions are all over the place. Ex. she'll tell you to name a file by one name and then in the instructions she tells you to name by a different one. By far one of the worst classes I have ever taken. Her tests are hard, she provides no type of PPP for you to know whats important and whats not. DON'T."
10523,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,2.0,4.0,"One of the most disorganized and confusing structure for class I have ever experienced. Though the content for the course was relatively easy and by the book, what made things the most challenging was the way Professor Rao communicated her expectations. Also, the final is hard, I suggest ace everything possible in the the course before you test."
10524,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,3.0,3.0,She is tough grader ! However to be fair she does provide you great feedback on the assignments. Many parts of the class was interesting! Take her !
10525,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,4.0,"Class was super ! Comp exa is hard ! One minute for one question. There is a study guideline but not much help. All other parts of the class is easy to somewhat hard, but manageable"
10526,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,2.0,"She is one of the best! Very clear instructions and expectation, interesting Discussion topics, unlike many student I actually loved Diet Analysis part 3. I did not get an A grade as I bombed in the comp exam ( the exam by the way is not made by prof rao) :"
10527,629673,Mamta,Rao,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Health Science,HUN2202,5.0,2.0,"I found the class between easy and hard. The comp exam is the only hard part of the class. Aced every assignment , Part 3 Diet Analysis was challenging yet scored 90%. Great class if you are planning to go into nursing."
10529,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"So get ready for a lot of homework BUT the homework goes right with the assignments. If you do the homework, you'll always get an A on the assignments. Although humanities is kind of a boring subject to some, she keeps it very engaging with videos that help a lot along with her lectures. She gives test study guides that are a life saver!"
10530,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,4.0,"Definitely take Professor Styles' HUM online class. While the course can be challenging at times, she was great at providing information for exams. She also teaches using the textbook and some questions on exams will be info in the textbook only. Overall, she was always there to help if I had questions and I would recommend her for sure."
10531,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"I dont even know what to say about her. I think shes probably gifted for teaching. She doesnt overwhelm you, it is a kind of an easy A, but she teaches everything she has to and makes everything clear. And more, shes very nice and knows how to handle a classroom. One of the best teachers Ive ever had. Just take her."
10532,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1000,3.0,4.0,Shes an amazing teacher! The lectures are very well stated. Essays will be assigned with 3-4 exams.
10533,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"I hate history because I find it all confusing and boring, but Ms. Styles turned that all around! She made learning easy and fun. Honestly, her lectures make me feel like I'm listening to bedtime stories. I actually remember the stuff she teaches! Her note-taking guides are also great help with the exams. Text book wasn't really used, but TAKE HER!"
10534,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,Took her online class. Multiple assignments but they were easy. Gives feedback on every assignment which is motivating. I recommend her.
10535,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,5.0,2.0,"what a fantastic teacher, period. I took the short summer term-Greek/Roman Hum-It was a lot of work for those 6 weeks! But, practically impossible to NOT have each assignment done by its date. I received an A or b+ on every task. Its open notes and open books on test and quizzes, (minus the final). She's funny, caring, personable and knowledgeable!"
10536,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,"Really loved Prof. Styles! She really know what she's talking about. In a c;ass that can get really boring she finds a way to keep you interested. One of the best class I've ever taken. Not too much work, if you give the littlest bit of effort you'll do just fine. Super accessible, easy to talk to, and very willing to work with you."
10537,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,The class was easy just a lot of work. The study guide has the same questions as a test.
10538,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,2.0,3.0,"Lots of work. You have to watch videos, read power points, read the textbook, upload papers. Does not accept late work. Put in the work and you will get the grade. Most test and quiz are easy as long as you do the handouts associated with them. Missing assignments will effect grades drastically."
10539,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,5.0,1.0,"Just take her! The best professor ever! Very caring, will help you any time! Amazing professor! if you need A, get her!"
10540,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,5.0,2.0,"She is the best! She always helps students, she really wants you to pass! Just do the work and get A, she will work with you!! She is awesome! Love her!!!"
10541,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2200,1.0,5.0,"Skip her class! Too much work, every class: quiz, essay and reading assignment. Takes her forever to grade papers. She can add new assignment just like that, tough grader!"
10542,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,Professor Styles is AMAZING! She loves teaching and it shows in how she responds to my emails. She has never hesitated to respond quickly and is never rude about any questions. I just adore her! I wish she could teach all of the classes at Valencia College because you are actually learning something and enjoying it! I hope she never retires!
10543,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"Karen Styles is an amazing professor. She is thorough and detailed in all her lectures , she makes sure you understand the material and she is kind and easy going. However, in order to do well in this class or in any class, one must do the work and study."
10544,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2223H,5.0,3.0,She helped me to have fun with the subject she was teaching she also was very caring and helped me a lot with my final paper.
10545,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,BRO i love her. i just had her for intro and now i want to have her for late roman and medieval. As long as you do her work and pay attention while she lectures (which isnt hard because she makes everything very interesting) youll pass with an A no doubt.
10546,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,3.0,I took Prof. Styles over the summer period so it was a little sped up but it was still easily managed with taking other classes. Her lectures and additional content via youtube videos are great. She gives you questions to answer as you watch the videos or read the chapters and most of the quiz questions come from those. Overall great professor.
10547,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2200,5.0,3.0,I would totally take this professor again! I have taken her for intro and just finished having her for Greek and Roman Humanities. The material is presented to you in an understandable manner. You know what assignments are due for the whole term via syllabus. 10/10 professor.
10548,171655,Karen,Styles,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Styles is a great professor! I took her online intro to humanities course and it was so easy! There are 2-3 20 question quizzes each week as well as a discussion board. It was super easy. I never got lower than a 90 on any assignment. She isn't a tough grader, super understandable and replies within the next day via email. I HIGHLY Recommend!"
10550,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,5.0,2.0,"Linda is an absolute gem - took her online for Fall 2020. All her lectures are PowerPoints that she records herself going over. She also attaches lecture notes &amp; YouTube videos. The discussions and assignments are really about what YOU learned, so pay attention &amp; its an easy A. You'd regret not taking her! 100/10"
10551,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1012,5.0,3.0,GREAT ONLINE TEACHER for General Psychology. This was my first online class and it was really organized and easy to understand. Her assignments are fair and she got back to me pretty quickly when I emailed her. I would take her again.
10552,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,5.0,4.0,"Dr Freeman's Positive Psychology course is awesome. She is a great teacher to have online. She is kind and responds to your emails pretty quickly. There is a lot of work to do, but the assignments are worth it."
10553,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,3.0,3.0,"Professor Freeman was kind, but she never responded quickly to emails which was stressful being in a Flex course. NO extra credit, NO late work, so if you miss an assignment you have to work hard the rest of the semester to bring up your grade. Even if you get 100% on everything else you still get a B in her class for missing an assignment or two."
10554,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"Lots of reading! However this is an easy A! Weekly you read a chapter, answer lots of questions, take a quiz and write a reflection. The reflections are mostly what you feel, Ive learned a lot about myself this semester, and I wish I could take other classes with her as my professor! Dr. Freeman is excellent!"
10555,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,5.0,3.0,"If you haven't considered take Positive Psychology as a psych major, think again. This course helped me get through not only my term, but through life. I was able to find my purpose writing in our reflections every week. Dr. Freeman is a GEM and wants the best for her students. Very useful class overall. Will be taking her for abnormal psych."
10556,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,5.0,3.0,Dr Freman is the most awesome professor I have ever had. She is perhaps the most smart and caring teacher at Valencia. Positive Psy is a great course that helped me a lot with my life. I really recommend that everyone take this course ! Thank you Dr Freeman for being so great. We love you.
10557,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PYS2861,5.0,3.0,"Awesome professor. Will be tking abnormal psychology with her. Just finished positive psychology. You have to write 2, 1 page paers per week. If you like to write about yourself and things that have to do about yourself, the writing is pretty cool. She is a great teacher. Audio Lectures are great to have."
10558,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,5.0,4.0,"I will be taking her next semester for an in-person class since she is very good at her lectures. I took the online flex class so be prepared to read a chapter once or twice a week from a mandatory textbook (found mine for $12 online), 2 or 4 papers a week, difficult 4 quizzes. Her audio lectures are super important. No extra credit."
10559,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,5.0,3.0,"Positive Psychology is a great course. There is a lot of work you will be doing that is mostly about yourself, so they are helpful. Dr. Freeman is not heavy on exams but has you writing many reflections. I found this class personally helpful. The only course I have taken that helps me with the way I think and act. I really liked the course."
10560,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,CLP2012,5.0,3.0,Loved Dr Freeman. Her lectures are super. She gives tons of examples and her videos are super cool ! I learned a lot !
10561,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,CLP2140,5.0,4.0,I really liked taking Dr Freeman online. She is pretty clear with her expectations. Everything is laid out in a way you don't have to go hunting for what to do next. She answers her emails really quickly which is a bonus. I would defintely recommend her Abnormal Psych course.
10562,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PYS2861,5.0,3.0,Cool teacher. Loved her positive psychology class. She is nice and makes you feel great about yourself. I really am glad I took course

10564,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1012,5.0,3.0,"dr freeman is one of my favorite professors at the college. she really connected with our class. she gets we all are not going to be interested in psychology, so her general psych. is a great course. she is interesting, but not pushy. We also meditated a couple of classes. that was super cool."
10565,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1012,5.0,4.0,"dr. Freeman is a really cool professor. She is pretty laid back in class, but her expectations are still pretty high. There is a lot of work around applying the stuff you learn in class. She is pretty easy to chat with and seems to get how hard it is to go to school and work. I really liked her and the class."
10566,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,CLP2012,5.0,5.0,really loved the class. Remember to do all your work and you will be good. Attendance policy is fair. She is clear in her instructions.
10567,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,4.0,"Enjoyed the class &amp; learned a lot. Accepts zero excuses for late work (no matter how valid) &amp; you'll get a zero for any late assignments. Onliners please note - Valencia says they have 24/7 tech support - NOT TRUE. If you have technical problems after hours or on the wknd, you're out of luck, so don't wait until the last minute to turn in work."
10568,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2861,5.0,4.0,Loved Positive Psychology ! Take this course if you can ! It is the BEST class I have even taken online !
10569,434322,Linda,Freeman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1012,5.0,4.0,I will never forget this class. Our General Psychology class was so awesome. I wish Dr Freeman could teach all my courses. The class was so cool. She brings up the coolest topics that we talked about. She does not bore you with long lectures. I would really suggest you take her if you can
10571,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000,5.0,2.0,"Great teacher and overall person, The assignments are pretty easy to do if you pay attention in class and the grading criteria is very clear. Classes aren't necessarily mandatory although it is very helpful when you attend so you don't miss information and ask questions later. Would definitely consider taking it again."
10572,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,3.0,"Professor Weeks was great, and the class was entertaining. It was tough dealing with COVID, but this course wasn't a challenge by any means. If you miss a lecture, he posts them online, which is also convenient. Overall I highly recommend taking this course even if you have the slightest interest in the world of digital media."
10573,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,4.0,3.0,Such a funny and understanding professor! He was great with keeping us updated though the COVID-19 pandemic and make the mandatory transition to online class as easy as possible. Just make sure you show up and take notes on the lectures and you will be good. Prepare for dad jokes too!
10574,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000,5.0,3.0,"Professor Weeks class was great, hes a good speaker even though his voice is quite monotone. His jokes and banter is often quite funny, i recommend his class and would take a course he teaches again."
10575,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,3.0,"A good professor that will help you when you speak to him. Gives out fun and engaging lectures. If ever given a chance, I would definitely take a class with him again."
10576,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,2000C,5.0,2.0,"If you know phtoshop and overall Adobe you're golden. I wasnt good at all at it and was my first time. Prof helped with clarifying what I missed when working on the photoshoot project, and wasnt a hard grader. Just need to put in and show your effort, the overall project itself is not the main focus. Ask qs if lost. Overall chill."
10577,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,3.0,Cool guy full of dad jokes and clear grading criteria! I took his class amidst the whole epidemic and he converted to an online format pretty smoothly.
10578,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,2.0,"You will love this class. If you have the chance to take it with Andy Weeks, then take it! You will not regret it. He is very good at teaching, has lot's of funny jokes, and will help you with any questions you might have to make sure you succeed in this class. This is by far my favorite class I have taken so far. You will have lots of fun."

10580,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,1.0,"I liked how he teaches his classes. He is a funny teacher and cares about his students. Never doubt to ask questions, he helps you with everything you need. However, I do think that before taking this class you should know a little bit about Adobe. His classes are always entertaining and you can understand everything clearly"
10581,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,2.0,"never was there a day where i did not want to go to class, professor weeks is a great teacher."
10582,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,3.0,"Lectures are easy, lots of information. You'll learn mostly with Adobe apps. If you have no experience with them, I suggest you practice with them before a lab day. Group projects are fun. Quizzes are easy just study your notes and read the power points he provides."
10583,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,3.0,2.0,"Everything in this class is hands-on. It's a little bit hard to learn new adobe programs if you never used them before because he does talk fast. The quizzes are pretty easy. Overall, Mr. Weeks is a decent professor."
10584,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,1.0,"Andy is a good professor, super funny, and willing to work with you. Classes are mainly lectures, if not then you're doing a lab. Andy does a great job at making the lectures enjoyable. Be prepared for dad/inappropriate jokes. Class is always let out one - two hours early."
10585,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000,5.0,3.0,"Listen to what he says, keep the slides in mind and remember that he prefer that you go beyond the minimum. You are competing in a very competitve field and Mr Weeks does clarify that from the beginning."
10586,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,2000C,5.0,3.0,"Prof. Weeks is one of the best and easiest prof. to take. Only took 2 quizzes and for the majority of our projects, he was right by our sides making sure we understood everything. If you do your work and listen in class its an easy A."
10587,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,2030C,5.0,3.0,"Professor Weeks is hands down my favorite teacher, and I wish he taught more of the classes in the digital media track. I feel like he truly wanted to see us succeed. He allows room to interject your own take/creativity into assignments and is a student's biggest cheer leader. I truly appreciate Mr. Weeks, and I learned a lot from him."
10588,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2030C,5.0,3.0,He is the best teacher I have ever had. He is probably the reason I have enjoyed Digital Media so much. If you can take him. Do it. I would take him every single chance I get.
10589,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,DIG2000C,5.0,1.0,This class was unexpectedly fun. Weeks does a great job engaging the class and keeping everyone interested in the work. The quizzes are really easy and you can even use your notes for them. I would recommend him for this course or the DIG-2030.
10590,1863376,Andy,Weeks,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Digital Media Production,2000C,5.0,3.0,"Mr. Weeks has created a fun environment to really learn the Adobe Creative Cloud programs. His class is more project based and less quiz based and the quizzes he does have you can use your notes on. The projects are appropriately challenging, and really leave you with a good grasp on the Adobe programs. Can't recommend enough."
10592,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ECO2013,2.0,3.0,He wont give you your grade till after finals which isnt really helpful you may think your passing but you may not. He only introduce you to the class then disappears. his assignments are easy but dont miss any chapters because it can hurt your grade. Its only you and knewton alta basically.
10593,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,5.0,3.0,Prof B. is a good guy who expects a lot of people but that is because he cares and wants to get you ready. I had him for two classes at Valencia. I worked hard to pass but it paid off when I got to UCF I'm graduating in December. Take him.
10594,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,5.0,4.0,Battiste has high expectations. I liked him. I didn't come to college to not learn. I'n going to use this stuff when I graduate. It is a hard class but he explained it and showed us what to do. Don't miss class.
10595,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,5.0,3.0,Professor Battiste is really good! His class is set up well and he is ready to help you learn. He used My lab and Mastering for all the homework which I thought was way easier to use than other courses. His lectures can be a little all over the place but the textbook and homework prepared you for tests. Best accounting professor at valencia.
10596,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,4.0,3.0,"Battiste is a great teacher. He's fair. Yeah, there is work to do but its accounting what do you expect? The class was hard but he prepared me for UCF and I learned."
10597,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2071,3.0,5.0,"It is very hard to learn from his lectures, so its a lot of on your own work. Tons of homework and lots of tests. The tests are insanely hard when you take them at the testing center. You just need to learn a lot on your own, and do all the homework. He lets you re take tests at the end of the semester which help boost your grade."
10598,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACG2071,3.0,5.0,Clear syllabus and calendar day. Did not learn much from him. His lectures are hard to follow. I learned more off of youtube but he was fair.
10599,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACG2021,1.0,5.0,If you are not a Accounting major DO NOT take him. He expects you to know everything before class. Quizzes are due every week and before the lecture of the chapter.
10600,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,1.0,5.0,"Do not take him. He is very scattered, and although he is nice, his homework takes me all day and I don't learn anything. His quizzes for the chapter are due before the assignments, which doesn't make any sense at all. I would drop it if I could because it is very stressful and he does not teach in class. Do not recommend."
10601,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACG2071,4.0,3.0,"His assignments were organized and laid out for the term, so I knew what to expect before starting. Unfortunately, he taught me literally nothing. Everything I learned in that class was self taught using the book. If asked a question, he refers you back to the book. Two tests have to be taken on campus. Not a terrible professor though."
10602,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACG2071,5.0,3.0,"This professor honestly might be one of the best professors ive had at Valencia. With that given you do have to keep up with the workload, but if you do it is rewarding. I found the professor to be very fair. I had him for both financial and managerial accounting and did very well and learned alot of valuable material."
10603,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,5.0,4.0,Prof Cecil was one of the best professors I had at Valencia. I was lazy and he doesn't accept that I actually failed his class the first time I took him but took him again and now I am about to get my MBA I graduate in May. He made me learn it. He forced me to stop being lazy and start applying myself.
10604,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACG2021,3.0,5.0,"Professor Battiste is a very unclear grader. He isn't very personable. I had his class MW, the first day he would lecture on something that wasn't on the test at the end of the week, the second day we did homework in class. Over the weekend the quiz for the next chapter was due. Every 3-4 chapters there is a test, which doesn't match the homework."
10605,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACG2021,3.0,4.0,"Battiste definitely keeps lectures lively.. He wants you to learn, but this is a professor for students that actually want to be accountants in life. It didn't quite feel like an entry level class. Homework assignments are loaded but doable. Both quizzes &amp; tests are VERY tricky! Not a bad guy though, he's pretty funny. Not for me though."
10606,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,5.0,4.0,Battiste is a good teacher if you make an effort. I liked the set up of the class and the textbook was good. The homework didn't take that long the tests were fair. I learned a lot and will take him again next session. No gifts. You have to earn your grade but that is to be expected.
10607,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,APA1111C,1.0,4.0,learned through you tube better than the class. Nice Professor however he speaks to fast. Tried to tutor with him and still couldn't learn with him.
10608,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,5.0,4.0,"Battiste cares about learning and that is why some students rate him lower. If you want an easy A look elsewhere. If are willing to think and try take Battiste. He will get you ready for UCF. As far as lectures, yes, they are short, that is because the class is flipped so I had to be prepared for class. I am taking him again for Manager Acctg."
10609,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACG2450C,5.0,2.0,"This was my first online class with Prof Battiste, and he was great. Very quick to respond to questions, and adjust grades when necessary. This class was easy as long as you read, and did the assignments."
10610,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,4.0,4.0,"Took for 2021 &amp; 2071. Quirky sense humor but i honestly enjoyed it. He could use a little work on explaining stuff in a simpler fashion, i think because he used to be a CPA it all seems simple to him lol. Honestly really cool guy though and if you truly study the homework and use the ""help me solve this"" you WILL do well on the tests even w.o. book"
10611,141333,Cecil,Battiste,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Accounting,ACCT2021,5.0,4.0,"Professor Battiste is a great teacher. He cares about getting you ready for the Real World above all else. You will work for your grade but you will learn a lot too. There are 4 tests and you get one ""mulligan"" which means you can retake one test and he will count the highest score."
10613,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,1.0,3.0,He is RUDE. I ended up withdrawing for this reason alone. I dreaded going to this class because it was an hour and a half of being afraid he would call me out and belittle me. If he asks a question and no one answers or they answer wrong he gets angry and makes rude sarcastic comments. I've never had a teacher that treated students so poorly.
10614,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,4.0,4.0,Took him for calculus 2 and its definitely not an easy class. But Franklin is a great guy and he shows that he truly cares about his students. He can come off as condescending at times but at the end of the day he will always sit down and explain a concept if needed.
10615,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"I took him for college algebra and had to withdraw because of how much of a horrible professor he was. The tests were not much of what he teaches in class and him teaching is basically him making his students feel dumb. Homework is not graded, only has about 4 tests which are all extremely hard for no reason. Do not take him."
10616,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,1.0,5.0,"As an aerospace engineering major and a lover of math, there is no way I can be successful in this class. All you get is four tests. He over-complicates his lectures and gets upset when his students can't replicate his work. He makes fun of and discourages students in his class with actions that of a child including syllabic talking and mumbling."
10617,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,2.0,4.0,"You can learn from his lectures, but they're far more confusing than necessary. Over-covers simple topics but spends no time on the complicated stuff and expects you to get them without actual teaching. Also, he's rude; avoid asking questions, he'll answer with sarcasm and treat you like you're stupid. Not sarcastic if you ask outside of class tho."
10618,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAP2302,5.0,4.0,"His lectures are concise, his proofs are straightforward, and he encourages his students to do well. He's available during office hours and welcomes you. He expects you to know material from prior courses but will refresh you if you're rusty. All tests are posted online weeks before they occur along with plenty of supplemental material!"
10619,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,1.0,5.0,People who like math wont pass his class. He makes students feel silly for asking questions. He will hurriedly cover a complex example and expect students to replicate it perfectly. Tests include extra credit but dont count on getting it. Dull lectures. Withdrew from class after second test. Took Calc 2 with different professor and received an A.
10620,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,1.0,4.0,"this professor does not help his class, he won't announce tests, respond to emails in case your sick and need to take a test at the testinc center, lecture is very unclear, no projector, no powerpoints, no webassign, no extra credit everything from the book like 4 tests. includes problems not in the book. idk why he teaches there"
10621,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,CALC1,5.0,4.0,"Prof Franklin is an incredibly polarized professor. Students either love or hate him. If you're a STEM major with a genuine love and intuition for math, then I highly recommend taking Franklin for the learning opportunity.  The exams come from either homework, examples in class, or the basic knowledge quizzes. He does give extra credit on tests."
10622,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,CALC2,1.0,5.0,"He will stop and start telling a joke in the middle of the class,  the syllabus are not updated. he does not use blackboard but has a specific website with the problems he wants you to do from the textbook in order to turn them in physically. will not announce test dates, respond to emails or let you take a test in the testing center if sick."
10623,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2313,5.0,3.0,"He is a great professor. If you pay attention during lectures, take note, and do the homework he assigns, you will pass the class with an A. His class is interesting! He is funny. He clearly explains all the topics in ways that make it easy to understand. He pushes you to do better.  The tests are based on homework."
10624,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,CALC2311,1.0,3.0,I WOULD NOT take him unless you are extremely good at math. I received an A in both trigonometry and precalculus and ended up dropping this calc class because it was the most awful thing to sit through. He's a bit mean and is not a good teacher. The tests are nothing like the homework. His class is boring and definitely not a learning environment.
10625,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,1.0,5.0,Literally worst professor ever! He is super mean and not helpful at all. I almost cried a couple times because he just that mean. He didn't follow the book and taught things from Calc 3 that not even the tutors could help me with. out the 28 students that started only 13 remained at the end of the final
10626,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2313,5.0,3.0,I love him.
10627,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAP2302,5.0,3.0,"I took Franklin for calc 2 in the summer of 2015,  and then calc 3 and DE in the fall.  He prepared me for UF's pure mathematics program and is a passionate mathematician who taught an intuitive understanding of the material.  Take him if you like math and actually want to learn the subject. Best prof. I've ever had.  The tests are from the HW, fyi"
10628,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,5.0,"I love professor Frankin. I recommend all the engineer majors to take him. He may be a little tough but you will learn alot from his class. Tests are not that hard. Just do all your Homework and even more problems online, and don't fall behind. NO CALCULATOR. You do not need it. Taking him for calc 2 right now."
10629,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,2.5,4.0,"He lectures all over the place, spending hours  on exceptions to the rule, leaving you scratching your head, like what? He also teaches directly out of the book, meaning he uses the math lingo and doesn't simplify it. I dropped the class, for my mental health, so that I didn't have to hear du/dx for the 8 millionth time in 3 weeks. Had an A, argh!"
10630,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,3.0,4.0,"Don't take this guy during a summer semester. A waste of time and plenty of other resources out there where you can learn the material far better. And I'm not talking khan academy either.   Expect a quiz for every class even before tests. A hard professor for an easy course. Unnecessary.  Don't be fooled by other comments here, he's no comedian."
10631,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAP2302,5.0,3.0,"Great professor. He is tough, but if you do the homework he assigns and pay attention during lectures, you will pass the class with an A. His lectures are great, he clearly explains all the topics in ways that make it easy to understand. Do the homework, even though it isn't required. Tests are based mostly off homework."
10632,159182,Jim,Franklin,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,TRI1114,4.0,5.0,"If you dont show up to class you will fail. If you dont do homework you will fail. If you dont study like crazy you will fail. HOWEVER if you do all of this things I guarantee you will pass the class and MASTER the math at the same time. His tests arent hard at all, just dont fall behind. Definitely taking him for Calc 1-3 and DiffEq."
10634,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Prof Howard is amazing, lots of homework but she gives extra credit, everyone passed her class with an A. Gives pop quizzes when students are absent :/ but you should def take her. I don't like math and got an A+ taking her class, she's accesible outside of class as well, as long as you do the hw you should be fine (she reopens before the final)"
10635,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,2.0,"Pros: Good @ explaining material. Online HW/Quizzes unlimited attempts until night before exam. Can ask HW questions at beginning of class. Extra credit given. Partial credit given for all work shown on exam. Previous tests are posted on website, STUDY THEM. Cons: HW is different from explanation. Pop quizzes are done when students are absent."
10636,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Professor Howard is one of the best Professors I have come by here at Valencia. I actually like Math but I have never taken any statistics class prior to STA 2023, so for someone who didn't know anyone previously she has made this class so easy and fun. She is the best at explaining and is very open if you need help outside of class. She's amazing!"
10637,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,4.0,3.0,"Prof. Howard is super nice and everything, but isn't that good at explaining things. I'm already good at Trig, so this class wasn't hard for me, but if I didn't know how to do trig, I would have failed for sure. Everything is based on MyMathLab."
10638,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,5.0,"Gave good notes but the didnt help with the homework, only the exams. Knewton sucks. She has long exams that are all written."
10639,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,I had a great time with Professor Howard. Really cares for her students and their grades. She wants to see everyone pass. Lectures but gives a lot of time to go over any hw questions. Hw is not hard as long as you lay attention in class. Gives extra credit and helps in office hours.
10640,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1140,3.0,3.0,class is only reviewing homework questions then she lectures about the next homework you have to do. All homework is due on a certain day before the test. being a math education major really helps me get through her class.
10641,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,4.0,"Gives good feedback, awesome and nice Professor. The only thing you might hate is the homework. There's a lot but they'll make you perform better on the tests."
10642,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,5.0,"She is amazing professor who loves her students. When she talks to you she always smiling, she is very warm and nice person. She makes this class easy with her nice personality. She cares and loves what she is doing and very good at. Class is hard but if you have take this class I will take with her."
10643,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,3.0,"Professor Howard wants her students to succeed. If you show up to class and do the hw you should do pretty well. The tests are the same as the hw, and she offers extra credit."
10644,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,4.0,"While she is a very kind and lovable woman, do not take her course. She will try to explain things the best she can but even she confuses herself while doing work which makes it more difficult. The formatting she does when she teaches and on the homework is completely different than the way her tests are written. Even tutoring didn't help here."
10645,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,2.0,5.0,"Deborah is a kind woman, but the whole class spent so much time correcting her mathmatical errors that there wasn't much time to learn.  When I asked for help on one problem it took her 45 minutes.  Tons of homework all due at the same time.   She is extremely scattered rarely shows up for office hours.  Tutoring center useless, final cumulative."
10646,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,4.0,She was a sweet professor though the coursework was pretty difficult to understand. Basically had to teach myself through homework problems and it kept getting harder and harder. She is willing to help you out though questions on homework or notes don't match up with the tests so you don't know what to expect. Never take her again!
10647,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,4.0,"she's honestly the sweetest person. She doesn't take attendance but don't think that is a good thing, if you miss a class you miss a lot. Quizzes and homework are all online and there is A TON of it. She teaches well but then you go to do the homework and get so lost. I spent numerous hours at the math spa and still couldn't understand :("
10648,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT1001C,5.0,1.0,Everybody had trouble with this class but it was literally so easy. The exams are posted on her website with almost the exact same questions. All homework is unlimited chances so all you have to do is listen in class and you are guaranteed an A.
10649,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Professor Howard is an amazing and caring professor. If you do your homework, you should be ok. I fell behind early in the class due to the death of my sister and Prof. Howard personally tutored me to get me up to speed. Stats is hard, but got back up to making A's again. I took her for Stat 1001, too, and had the same opinion."
10650,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1140,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Howard is so great! She's always so happy and she really loves what she teaches. She explains things very clearly, and your best bet is to work slightly ahead so you can ask for specific questions you have issues with. You will pass if you keep up with ALEKS, but it's a good bit of work if you don't learn quickly. Great prep for Calc."
10651,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,I love Her! Great at teaching math all hw and quizes done online test are from homework. You have a whole week to finísh hw and quizes unlimited tries it is Alot of work but she Works out the problems in class drops 1 homework 3quizes and replaces your final (easiest test of all) with your lowest test grade 3test in total.
10652,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Professor Howard was amazing. Stats is hard, but she was always there to help me with my questions. She is a very sweet lady with a great sense of humor. We do have homework but its all online, and so are all the quizzes. She also drops three quizzes and one homework. Also gives extra credit for donating blood or $ to a charity. TAKE HER!!!"
10653,219096,Deborah,Howard,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,3.0,3.0,"All homework and quizzes are online on the Pearson program and I hated that. 1-2 quizzes each week and tries are unlimited. Only does 1-2 problems per section and when you get to the homework, you're completely lost. The tests are exactly like the quizzes and are fairly easy. 4 tests and a final. Would not take again."
10655,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC101,1.0,4.0,She was a very bad teacher at first it was nice but she is so unclear with instructions. She gave me a 0 on an essay because I got off topic for one paragraph. Brining my A to an F. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this professor.
10656,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,1.0,3.0,She is easily the toughest grader for essays out of any professor I've ever had in my life. Insane how she will give you a 0 for 2000 word essay because it is off-topic for half a paragraph.
10657,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,2.0,3.0,"If you value your time, Dauer isn't for you. The entire class is watching &amp; examining PSAs and short videos w/o knowing why. (To teach you short lessons for upcoming essays). As a freshman class for new college students, her high expectations were confusing when she didn't explicitly direct you to the Atlas MLA resources you need for the essays."
10658,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC101,3.0,3.0,"If you're going to take her class make sure you are not a sensitive person. She's actually pretty funny and sarcastic. There is a lot of group work, and sometimes pop quizzes. She gives plenty of extra credit, but is a pretty tough grader. I don't think this class improved my writing, but I did get something out of it."
10659,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,2.0,4.0,All work out side of class is essays. Class work is just busy work to take up the whole time of the class. She didnt grade my classes class work for months since its like 300 points for the whole semester. Also the lectures are irrelevant to the subject.
10660,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,5.0,5.0,She actually cares about her students.
10661,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,4.0,4.0,"Dr. Dauer is clear about her expectations for assignments and is willing to review rough drafts to give input and advice. She lectures on literature, challenging students to think about the content, meaning of stories and writing style through open discussion each class. Do not miss class or be late, turn papers in and follow MLA format."
10662,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,1.0,4.0,"Extremely tough grader, lost a whole grade letter on an essay and she only wrote a single chicken scratch on my paper, how am I supposed to improve from my mistakes if there are no actual errors provided. Class is boring and unhelpful."
10663,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,COMP2,1.0,5.0,she is a very unhelpful teacher. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! YOU WILL HATE YOUR LIFE !!! she is very strict and the class is very boring. The way she talks is very boring and low. this class will drop you GPA like it did to mine.
10664,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,3.0,4.0,"The class consist of reading a science fiction story of her choosing and then discussing it in class, she might or might not give you a quiz on the story. Also, she does not put ANY grades online so good luck knowing how youre doing. Never teaches you what she wants to see on the papers. Basically, dont take her unless youre an amazing writer"
10665,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,I would not recommend this professor! She is very picky and critiques everything when It comes to turning in your essays. I had a very hard time in this class and struggled to get a good grade on my essays. She is a very tough teacher and hard grader.
10666,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,COMP1,1.0,5.0,Tough Grader. Would not take
10667,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,This professor was extremely confusing. She's also a hard grader. We read science fiction throughout the semester (22 stories) but did not get to write about them much at all- how do I improve my writing if I am not writing much? I do not recommend this professor.
10668,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,4.0,WORST PROFESSOR NO JOKE When other posts are saying the same thing they are right! Dauer is mean rude &amp; not helpful one bit. Withdrew from the class cause she made me literally &amp; said if I didn't I would get an F regardless. She doesn't care abt her students &amp; doesn't take excuses for anything. Very tough grader &amp; only likes things her way.
10669,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,4.0,"Professor Dauer is the best English professor I have ever had. Her grading process is something I think all English and humanities professors should adopt: you turn in your final draft, she adds commentary, and if it isn't an A quality paper, you have the chance to rewrite it and make all of the changes she suggested. Perfect for ENC1102."
10670,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,WORST PROFESSOR EVER
10671,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,Professor Dauer is the worst professor i ever had it is like she likes to see you fail She is evil I hated every single class There are readings that we have to do before each class that might take up to an hour and u can't know which ones to read or not because she gives quizzes whenever she feels like it WERE IN A COLLEGE NOT HARVARD.
10672,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,4.0,2.0,"I really liked Dr. Dauer. Her class is a bit dry but easy. I thought she was funny and a really nice person. She doesn't take any crap, ANY crap so don't try her. Some don't like this but I respected her so much for it. So many students expect to be handed an A without working for it. She will make you work for it but it's so easy. I'd take again."
10673,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"I have taken both ENC 1101 and ENC 1102 and she was amazing! Yes, she is a tough grader, but she works with students who are willing to try. She is very nerdy and her humor is cynical. She gives clear expectations on what is expected and gives the students multiple resources if they need help, including herself. She will make you a better writer."
10674,186874,Susan,Dauer,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,This teacher is very sarcastic! She will make you feel so stupid !! and make you feel like you shouldn't try !! please anyone who reads this please believe me!!She kicks people out of class just because  you have a part of an assignment wrong!! Its ridiculous Half of my class dropped this class after a few weeks just being in this class!!!!!

10677,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,4.0,2.0,Professor Holliday can be a little shocking for those with sensitive dispositions. His jokes are a little dark but funny. He explains concepts really well and cares about the process of writing a great essay. He is very direct and gives great feedback on papers. Honestly nothing bad to say about him.
10678,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,1.0,5.0,"DONT DO IT. If you want a good grade, dont do it. Im letting you take someone else. I dont know if its because I took him class online but for and English 2 class, he made the course to difficult"
10679,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,1.0,1.0,Will destroy your grade if your ideas don't align with his regarding your essay.
10680,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,5.0,2.0,"Truthfully, I hate english but Holliday made it worth the while! 3 major essays, other assignments are simply just preparation for those essays. 1200 min, 1300 max; not too bad! Not a tough grader and will give you great feedback (will also help you if you turn in essays early). Essays take up your entire grade so turn them in on time!"

10689,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,COMP1101,5.0,2.0,"Professor Holliday is one of the best teachers I have ever had. Not to mention, the guy is hysterical. His class is very simple and easy to pass as long as you show up and do all required essays. Highly recommend taking him for any of the comp classes. It will be a class that you will enjoy going to everyday."
10690,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,3.0,"Professor Holliday is one of Valencia's best teachers. Professor Holliday is dark, hurtful, cruel, helpful, inspirational, knowledgeable. ENC-1002 is very theatrical and if there is someone that can teach a subject that you want to keep exploring than Holliday is the teacher that you want. I left after his class and still contact him for guidance."
10691,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1101,5.0,1.0,"Made English an actual fun and entertaining class while still teaching you a lot and giving good feedback on essays. This semester I wasn't able to take his 1102 class so I got stuck with a new teacher and got sent back to the real world of boring, terrible English teachers."
10692,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC101,5.0,2.0,simply the best
10693,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,2.0,"I loved this professor. He is really funny and never gave us too much work that would make us stress out. You do about 6 short story quizzes in class which are easy, and 3 essays and the word count gets smaller after each essay. My only complaint is that he does bash out on religion, especially Christianity. But overall he knows what hes doing."
10694,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1102,5.0,1.0,I took him for ENC1101 and ENC1102 and I absolutely loved him. His class was super easy and we barely did anything. Just you write 4 papers but he gives you clear instruction on how to write them and they have a shorter word count as the semester goes on. Also he is the funniest human being I've ever met and really relatable.
10695,18011,Clay,Holliday,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,COMP1101,5.0,2.0,Really cool dude. You can tell he was one of those alternative guys in high school. The entire class was just essays but you spent a week going over how to set them up. He basically wrote them for you. Easy A if you just show up and turn in your essays.
10697,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT101,1.0,1.0,You will be doing more work than the professor. He will not look into MyStatLab errors because he thinks it is not fair for him to put in that extra focus. This is a quote from a lecture of his. He grades daily assignments like a test and takes 2 weeks for you to get them back and gets mad if you have any questions about his grading.
10698,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,CALC2,1.0,4.0,"Class was Calculus 3. His thick accent, is difficult to understand sometimes. He skips a lot of steps and expects that everyone knows what he is doing. When you ask him to explain he goes over it real fast without taking the time to really go into detail, when clearly people don't understand the problems. Avoid him if possible."
10699,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,4.0,3.0,"He has a thick accent but is still understandable. He cares if the class understands the subject and will repeatedly ask ""Do you understand"" to the point it almost sounds rhetorical. Late work is not accepted as far as I knew. The Test/quizs weren't hard but were time consuming, failing a test or quiz because you didn't know it enough to finish."
10700,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,4.0,3.0,"Nice professor and a strong teacher. He really doesn't mind going over previous topics about trig and precalc, no question is too basic to ask him. Very lenient grader who always likes to give points when able. He appreciates the active students in the class, so try to engage with him. Overall, I'm glad to have taken him for Calc1. Ready for calc 2"
10701,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,3.0,He is the best math teacher I've ever had at Valencia. I received an A because his lectures were very understandable and valuable. He is always straight to the point; no beating around the bush. His lectures were perfectly paced in order for everyone to understand the topics thoroughly. He is always available for questions and concerns.
10702,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT2023,4.0,3.0,"A LOT OF QUESTIONS in mystatlab, but every quiz and daily assignment is easy to do. He gives you leverage to get a good grade on the class. Exams are pretty straightforward. Really accessible outside the class."
10703,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,2.0,"He is a very nice professor. He cares a lot about his students. Once you are able to understand what he is talking about, he is actually very good at teaching math. He does give a lot of homework but grades quite easily."
10704,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,2.0,"super helpful laid back class, make sure to do the my stats lab otherwise it'll get too much also don't forget about daily assignments they add up and are helpful. Not a lot of work and prof is chill helpful outside of class as well. I am horrible at math and only reason I got a C was I didn't do the daily assignments. Gave very similar prac tests"
10705,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"great class he is super funny. there are usually daily assignments, mystatlab every week and 3 tests. only few quizes only for extra credit. this subject is hard at times but he is easy to work with a answers all your questions."
10706,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,"Typical day revolves around going through the chapter and answering examples, then answering 3 to 4 questions for homework that are due the next class period. Make sure you do the weekly statlab because it'll catch up to you! overall he taught well and tries to make you understand as much as possible. Hard subject but he made it bearable. take him!"
10707,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,4.0,5.0,"Hes an amazing guy and will help you out when you need it. He has a weird teaching method and it didnt work for me, which made the class harder. He gives a lot of extra credit which boosts your grade. He has a weird grading system and doesnt post grades on canvas. Do his daily hws and do good on his exams and youll be fine"
10708,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,3.0,"Great professor, gives assignments for points, reviews before test and class is overall pretty easy."
10709,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,"Everyone on here has negative things to say but I find him to be a great professor. The only thing is having to calculate your grade. He laughs at his own jokes and it's pretty entertaining to watch. He is clear / his instructions, and gives 3 tests. Each test is given a review which is extremely helpful. I could have easily earned an A if I did HW"
10710,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,2.0,"Great math professor! He is very knowledgeable about the subject and he makes sure that everyone understands the material before moving on. There are daily assignments for each chapter, 3 tests, and the final. He uploads a study guide with answers for each test and goes over the study guide in class, which is very helpful."
10711,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,2.0,4.0,"This teacher does not have a mandatory attendance. I missed 6 classes in a row and nothing happened. He has paper homework assignments every night but, homework is 50 points of out the 500 available. Lectures are long and his voice is straight boring. I would recommend finding another teacher for Calc 1!"
10712,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,he is a horrible professor. very mean professor. hard to understand. tons of homework and horrible tests and very long. do not take him.
10713,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT2023,1.0,5.0,Not recommended at all. A lot of material for a class that should be an easy class. You have to buy the book and a lot of online and paper assignments.
10714,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,CALC2,1.0,5.0,Don't take him. He is a very hard professor a lot of homework and if you skip class no excuse and attendance is mandatory. Test are very hard a lot of uncovered materials especially essay questions. You have to buy the book and my stat lab around $200
10715,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT2023,1.0,5.0,Dont take this professor. He has a very hard accent to understand. Tests are horrible. A lot and a lot of homework and daily assignment. A lot of searching online too. Not recommended at all. You have to buy my stat lab code . He is the only professor does this for this class.
10716,309134,Abdul,Zainulabdeen,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT2023,1.0,5.0,He is a tough grader. Make you buy the book and my stat lab which other professors don't. Plus A lot of daily assignment. Test are so hard and a lot of material that he never covers. No extra credit and no excuses. Attendance is mandatory.
10718,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,3.0,A lot of reading from the textbook. You cannot get around reading the textbook because the test she has revolve around the textbook. There was also only one essay. The assignments and discussions were not that hard as long as you read the textbook.
10719,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,2.0,2.0,Tough grader
10720,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,She didn't assign an excessive amount of assignments and cared for her students. I didn't think I could get my grade up from a B+ to A- but I gave it my all for the final project and she gave me the best grade she could to get me up to an A. Would take again.
10721,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,3.0,1.0,"Very rude when it comes to feedback. Easy class, but very crappy teacher."
10722,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,"Professor Rumbley was one of the best professor's I ever had. She's very considerate, especially if you are late in handing things in. All I needed to do was contact her and she really listens. My grandmom passed away and we had to travel, so I lost some time. Her work isn't too hard. She tells us to follow all directions, thats it."
10723,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,1.0,5.0,"When I thought I scraped the bottom of the barrel, I then took this professor. Save yourself the time and hassle. Very unfair when it comes to grading. I'd even go as far as saying degrading with her feedback. Her rating on this website is misleading. I took her believing she was a good professor, ended up being the worst I've ever had by far."
10724,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,1.0,5.0,Not a friendly lady at all. Very critical of my assignments. She finds anything possible to mark down my assignments. Very discouraging to actually learn and thrive in this course.
10725,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,1.0,4.0,"The test reviews were pointless, the questions on the test were not even on the review!The tests were very hard. Studied my butt off &amp; took notes (online course) &amp; still missed several questions. This class totally wrecked my G.P.A.!!! I recommend taking from a different professor!"
10726,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,3.0,"Good teacher and easy class, although she can be a pain at times. Some of the smart remarks she made were unnecessary, and if there is an error on her part its automatically your fault. The class and curriculum is easy, just the way she comes off isn't exactly the best."
10727,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,1.0,3.0,I highly advise you to not take this class! By far the worst
10728,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,I took this professor online and she is great. He setup is very clear and you already know when things are due since the beginning of the semester. If you do not want to spend money on the book you don't have to she provides a lot of material online. The tests are not easy but not too hard either. Focus a lot on discussions. Amazing professor.
10729,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,1.0,5.0,she grades so hard and if you miss one test she takes off 100 points from you final exam. idk what everyone was talking about when they said she was a great funny teacher because i didn't laugh once. DON'T TAKE HER lol
10730,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,2.0,3.0,She gives WAY too much work that isn't needed. She grades too hard. i dont think anyone for any class should take her
10731,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2234,4.5,2.0,Took her for all of my humanities. She's just awesome. Definitely a professor I will remember.
10732,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"Karen Rumbley is an amazing professor. You know how some older adults try to act cool or hip, but in all reality are lame. Professor Rumpley (nickname not misspelled) is the total opposite of that. She can really relate to students and as long as you pay attention and do you study guides, you will get and A+ and be laughing your butt off in class."
10733,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,2.5,4.0,"Professor Rumbley is a very nice lady, however she is unclear with her expectations and is inconsistent. I was recieving full credit on all of her write ups, A 100% on her paper, and over a full grade on her final project, A's and B's on her exams and was sure I earned the A, however she gave me a B.  She doesn't post anything to blackboard."
10734,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.5,1.0,"She is an awesome teacher. I learned so much from her lectures and have done pretty good on her tests. Her lectures makes you understand easily. One thing though, when you do her study guides, make sure you are VERY detailed and follow her grading criteria or else she will take lots of points off. Other than that she's great! I recommend her!"
10735,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,1.0,"took for intro during a summer course 4 days a week and always looked forward to her class. amazing real life experiences added to lectures. always has a hilarious side comment to make. no homework, all test were multiple choice and final was an art project. easiest A ever."
10736,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,5.0,1.0,This Professor was the best ever!!!! Idk if she's still at Valencia but she was amazing.
10737,321047,Karen,Rumbley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,1.0,"This Professor made her classes very interesting, she is super funny and her class itself is a breeze. She does not tolerate skipping class, however, she is all around a great teacher!"
10739,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT0028C,5.0,2.0,Amazing Professor. I'd def recommend taking her class. You'll learn math correctly as it's hard to find a good match teacher. She's almost always available. And easy A of you work hard.
10740,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033C,4.0,2.0,"Theres literally no way of failing this class as long as you pay attention to the lectures she gives, and attend the Student Assistant Workshops. I honestly believe towards the end of the semester, she was trying her hardest to make it ridiculously easy for us to pass with multiple opportunities for us to turn our worst test score into a 100."
10741,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,3.0,"Every math class at Valencia has the same homework load because its online through a website so as long as you pace yourself you should be fine. She doesnt respond to emails but she gives access to her number to contact her. Just take notes during class, its helpful!! Also, do all HW and labs, she will drop your lowest tests at end of semester."
10742,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"She seems like a nice lady, but her teaching method is very different. If you cant handle very fast lectures, I wouldnt recommend taking her. Only give 3 test the whole semester with opportunity for extra credit but test are very different than how she teaches. Test are lots of word problems but in class she doesnt teach you that way."
10743,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023H,2.0,5.0,"She means well but her teaching method isnt understandable. 3 exams, 1 project, and online/book hw replaces lowest exam grade. Get all As on exams(raw score not with extra credit) final will be waived. Literally the hardest class I took at Valencia. I strongly recommend not taking her!"
10744,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033C,1.0,5.0,Dont take it if you cant understand someone who talks really fast and doesnt help much
10745,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,1.0,5.0,"She talks about personal life more than she teaches. does not offer any help when a person is asking. she rely too much on student help. Her accent is heavy, so you wont understand what she says, and she don't repeat herself. I am not bad at math, its actually my favorite subject but she makes me HATE it. DON'T BOTHER"
10746,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT2023,5.0,5.0,"This class was a HUGE struggle. Professor Graff is amazing though. This is the first time I actually learned life skills that will probably come in handy with everything that I do. She is very honest and SUPER caring. She will not help you unless you sees you work to help yourself first. Go to Study halls, Do your HW, do all extra credit."
10747,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023H,1.0,5.0,"Professor Graff is not a good professor. For her, a student will understand if she/he has analytical skills, otherwise the student won't because she/he ""just doesn't get it"" . It's seriously terrible. For that, she doesn't take too much time explaining the class content. Even when she explains something, those 15min are sometimes incomprehensible."
10748,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,3.0,5.0,I have a 4.0 and am currently failing her class. Your grade is based on the three tests and the final. We only go over the lecture and do a few problems than on to the next. She does not stay on a topic and do multiple problems to ensure that everyone has the ability to complete the topic. I love math and this class has been terrible. (Statistics)
10749,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,2.0,4.0,"Her class is basically about passing the test. Homework is optional, but it helps if you won't do well on the test. Extra credit is available, so use it. And she talks a lot about herself and personal life. Personally, this is a self taught class. Study and use all the help you can get to grasp the concept of this course."
10750,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033,1.0,5.0,"Shes caring and all but if you're not good at math don't take her class. She teaches differently and is more advanced she told me to basically withdraw from the course since I wasn't understanding her way of teaching. She expects you to already know everything and move on to the next lesson after a week, also too much homework."
10751,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STAT2023,1.0,4.0,"I feel as if she leaves out information, does not have anything organized. Majority of the class dropped due to the lack of information presented. Take if you want to stress over tests that she created to purposely fail you. You get three exams and a final. You do get test cheat sheets but be aware as she does not specify, Its a lot, she's petty."
10752,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023H,4.0,4.0,"Grade is based solely on tests and project (for honors), so it forces you to understand the material. Not time-consuming. Graff is intimidating at first, but hilarious, knowledgeable and always available to clarify. She has a unique teaching method that helps you to remember and understand information. Lots of extra credit opportunities."
10753,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,3.0,Great professor. She takes time out of her day to help with study halls and she cares that you actually learn and understand stats. She is very nice and very funny! She connects her class to real like situation which just makes it that much more interesting. Tough class but she makes it fun and interesting.
10754,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,5.0,1.0,"At the beginning of the semester, I thought of dropping out  of her class. However, I did not  and that was one of the best decisions I have made. She likes to make sure that students comprehend the material. She's not easy when it comes down to giving away answers, she's better at making students find the answers. I highly recommend her. :)"
10755,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023H,5.0,3.0,"SHE IS SIMPLY THE BEST PROFESSOR. At the beginning you will fell lost, but she teaches step by step and you will learn so easily. YOU WILL REALLY LEARN"
10756,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,3.0,"Awesome math professor! In every lecture, she gives you the notes you need to complete the homework and is very thorough. Lots of homework problems though. Must be written by hand. Tests are harder than the homework, but if you practiced the homework problems, you will be fine. She cares a lot about her students and want you to try your best :)"
10757,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,STA2023,4.0,4.0,"Stats is hard but Ms Graff helped in every way she could. Homework is extra credit for the tests and she gives a lot of extra credit opportunities. She will do anything she can to help you pass, even meeting up with you outside of school. She is tough and scared me at first, but I wouldn't have passed with any other teacher."
10758,219800,Sophia,Graff,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MATH1033C,5.0,1.0,By far the easiest class that I have ever taken
10760,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1105,5.0,2.0,Always sent out emails if you missed a homework assignment to make sure everything was going okay and let us know when she had updated grades. Quickly responds to emails. Provides slideshows for each chapter for additional help. My first college math class and she made it go by like a breeze. Grade is based off of averages of hw and quizzes mostly.
10761,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,Mrs. Acosta is an amazing by far one of the best I have had at Valencia. She made the material easy to understand. Also she made the online process easier than I intended it would be. Her lectors are very organized on PowerPoints. She's Very clear and she is very fast at responding &amp; helpful. Easy passing grade if you apply yourself and try.
10762,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1033CONLINE,5.0,3.0,Great teacher.  Took her class online.  I am terrible at math and I got a B.  She is super sweet and will help you in any way possible.  Take her.
10763,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"I am horrible at math and still passed!!!  She provided so many resources and her directions are so clear that it would be difficult to fail this class. 2 take home tests and 2 tests in the testing center. She is very quick to respond to emails and provides great and helpful feedback. I gave a 4 for difficulty, only because I am that bad at math."
10764,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Acosta is very quick to respond to emails and is happy to answer any question you may have, no matter how silly. Her grading structure is simple and gives you an opportunity to make up a low test grade with your final. I took 2 online classes with her and they're the first time I ever aced math! Extremely helpful and nice."
10765,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1033,5.0,2.0,"So easy to communicate with her. I had an online class, and she made it so easy to follow up and finish the assignments She will work with you if need be. She is constantly striving and pushing her students! She was my first online class ever and gave me a great experience."
10766,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1033CONLINE,5.0,4.0,"I would never take an online class but I did with Mrs Acosta and absolutely loved it.  There are 2 take home tests and 2 on campus tests, buy a graphing calculator!! It will help greatly with a lot of problems. She is also great help through email as well, every time I needed help she would write things out step by step. Highly recommend her."
10767,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"I LOVED THIS ONLINE CLASS. I prefer online classes anyways but she made it so straightforward that it was really easy to learn and actually remember the content of the material we covered. If you stay a week ahead, this class is super stress free. Also, i  never used a graphing calculator before and I learned so much about it in this class. xx"
10768,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,"Mrs. Acosta is a great professor, even for online classes! I have never seen a professor put so much effort and care into their online courses. She has a variety of materials available from ppts on each lesson to reviews. She provides her own textbook, but it's very clear and straightforward. The homework is also easier than that of MML."
10769,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,"Math requires a lot of practice and time, but professor Acosta was there for any question that I have. Last time I saw algebra was 15 years ago and the way she presented her material make it easy to understand. Over all great professor, I do recommend her class. She provided videos, examples, power points and links for every chapter."
10770,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"A very good math teacher to say the least. I did her college algebra in the hybrid mode and it was a lot of work to keep up with due to most of the work being online, but if you stay on top of all the homework and quizzes you will make a good grade."
10771,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.5,3.0,"Took her for College Algebra as a Hybrid class. Expect homework at least 2 times a week. Sets up course for entire semester from the beginning. If you want to complete assignments early you can. Very strict on due dates though. I would go to class as much as possible as she gives the quizzes in class. 2 take home test, midterm and final."
10772,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Considering I took this class online, I absolutely loved taking it with Prof. Carr. She treats it as if it were an on campus class and really communicates with her students. She gives a lot of homework and there are about four tests including the midterm and final exam. The material can be a bit challenging but she'll respond to emails within hours"
10773,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1033CONLINE,5.0,2.0,I took Acosta online both for MAT 1033C and for MAT 1105 and I'm glad I did. She lays out all the assignments that are due at the beginning of the semester and she is very hands on and helpful with her students. I personally struggled with one or two tests in Mat1105 but she really helped me and did everything she could so I could pass with an A/B.
10774,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"I took Acosta online for MAT 1033. The requirements are lined up for you are the beginning of the semester which made this class easy to me. Each week you have about 1 or 2 homework assignments on Web Connect. Then there are 4 test total. Two timed ones to take at home, then two untimed ones to take at the testing center. Glad I took this professor"
10775,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"She's a great teacher, i took her as a hybrid course and should come out with a B. I would take this teacher again."
10776,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Professor Acosta is a wonderful professor. Very nice and helpful.  Her expectations are clear and she is HIGHLY organized. Took her for a hybrid course,  2 of the 4 exams are take home. Everything she teaches is exactly what is on the exams, quizzes.  No makeup for quizzes which count as a test grade, so don't skip class. Take her! "
10777,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC,4.5,2.0,"She wrote the book if that tells you anything. Very helpful and will get back to your questions VERY quickly. I recommend to everyone, especially those who find math hard. "
10778,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033,4.5,4.0,Acosta replied to all my emails faster than the speed of light! lol  She is very clear on the policies and I can see that cares about students. Tests are tough. you need to study a lot tp pass this class. I didnt and  paying for it :(
10779,158985,Gisela,Acosta,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033,5.0,1.0,"Amazing teacher! Gives you a clear schedule and send messages at the beginning of week to remind you. If you do the homework a little bit every day, it's not going to be overwhelming. Quick response by e-mail, and goes the extra mile (she sent me a review of my test mistakes when I requested). Totally recommend her!!!  "
10781,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,"Nothing to complain about him. He has video lectures for every single section, and is also on zoom everyday during office hours to help you. Hw due every 2-3 days, 1 quiz a week. If you are a busy person maybe take someone else. He is a tough grader but his expectations are clear, just do it exactly like the videos. He really cares about teaching."
10782,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAP2302,1.0,4.0,"Don't waste your time. If you can take differential equ at ucf or with a different professor do so. There are better professors who have better ways of teaching. Also beware, what you learn may not be what's tested."
10783,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,4.0,4.0,"Professor Joel is a great person, sadly calc 2 was moved online but he had many videos recorded to combat the loss time in classrooms. His videos are very lengthy so I'd suggest anyone who's taking him watch other people's and see their perspective, then watch his videos for specific ways to attack the topic. 4 tests, 1 final, and lots of youtubing"
10784,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAP2302,1.0,4.0,Professor Berman is terrible. He provides lecture videos that aren't really helpful. His quizzes and tests are very hard and he is an extremely harsh grader. He doesn't care about his students at all. He is extremely harsh on how you do your solutions and will mark you wrong if you use a different method to solve it other than his own.
10785,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,1.0,3.0,"Makes math uninteresting. Has boring lectures and is not easy to talk to. Doesnt seem to care at all about his students. Not particularly difficult, just incredibly draining to sit through."
10786,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1033C,5.0,3.0,"Great class, I would take it again. Although it is basically you teaching yourself, by reading the textbook Prof. Berman helps out. During the tests he tells you, in canvas, to do ALL of your problems on paper whether they're easy or not. This helps him review the questions you answered w what you worked out. My first exam went from a D to a B."
10787,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,1033C,2.0,3.0,"Very unreasonable. Your grade will heavily rely on the tests rather than the actual amount of work you put into his class. When you try to ask for help in ways of improving your grade he is very unhelpful. Would not take again. If you learn well from watching YouTube videos, this is the class for you. Good luck!"
10788,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,3.0,"I took Mac 2312 online class with him in the fall and I loved it. He uses videos which are easier to understand. He is an easy person to contact. He always answers your emails right away. If you watch all the videos and do the assignments and quizzes, you will do fine on the tests. So far, my favorite class."
10789,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,4.0,Professor Bermans Online Course is super organized. He offers video and lots of online examples. He tells you what problems to expect on each test. He gives you 3 hours in the testing center to do the do tests so you have plenty of time. He also hand grades your quizzes and tests and scans them back to you graded. Best online class Ive taken!
10790,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,1.0,5.0,"HE IS THE WORST TEACHER ive ever taken. He made me hate math. His class is PRETTY tough, and he require for us to do hw every 2-3 days. EACH TEST IS THREE HOURS LONG with TEN PAGES! (Not only the final test, EACH TEST) DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!! HE IS THE WORST!"
10791,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,2.0,4.0,"Grades on very few things, he uses a textbook that no other Trig professor uses because it harder and $150. He normally teaches much higher maths so he ends up teaching his trig class the same as his differential equations class but doesn't realize we can move as fast and pick everything up as easy as those students. Don recon theres much better"
10792,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,4.0,"Professor Berman was awesome! His lectures really simplified some difficult concepts. They are also very concise, to the point, and provide plenty of examples. His feedback, grading, and responses were almost instant. There are no surprises on his exams. He is very straight forward about what will be on them as well as provides a study guide."
10793,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAP2302,4.0,3.0,"Great way to take diff eq. He is great and explains topics well. Tests are fair and reflect quizzes. He gives good feedback and is happy to help. Excellent class, really recommend."
10794,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,3.0,"Professor Berman is a fantastic professor. I took his online Calc II course and you have to be responsible and dedicated to studying on your own to succeed in the course. Professor Berman gives you ALL the tools required to pass his class and the tests mimic the video problems. Calc II isn't easy, don't blame the professor if you suck at math."
10795,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAP2302,5.0,3.0,"Took diff. eq online and had a fantastic experience. Lecture videos were super helpful and clear. Resources like practice problems and solution videos were abundant. No surprises on the tests, just like lecture and practice questions, plus guides so you know exactly what to study. Prof. replied very fast to messages. Best structured class I've had."
10796,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"In this online class, Joel has very easy-to-understand lectures. There are about 3 homework assignments due each week but they take 10 minutes tops. The quizzes and tests aren't too hard if you learn the material in the lectures and homework. Great set-up in my opinion and he always replies back right away when you email or text."
10797,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,3.0,3.0,Fail Trig first time taking it. Joel made it much easier to understand. Willing to help but you must apply yourself. Im going to take him again for Calc 2. Very nice.
10798,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,3.0,3.0,"Professor Berman is extremely particular. Quizzes had to be submitted as ONE PDF file or points were deducted, and he even requested to assure pages were in the correct order to refrain from point deduction."
10799,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1033C,3.0,2.0,"I took this class online and it wasn't too difficult as long as you keep up with the homework, which there were multiple homework assignments due each week and take your tests you should be fine. My biggest problem was procrastination and I fell behind and it was hard to catch up. There is one extra credit. All in all, this class wasn't bad."
10800,131928,Joel,Berman,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,Absolutely fantastic! Disregard the other reviews rating Professor Berman on this website. The people who are leaving Berman bad reviews are the people who don't try in his class and don't put forward effort. If you put in the work and you try in his class Professor Berman goes out of his way to help you understand what you have difficulty with.
10802,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,Great professor especially if you are majoring in Psychology She helps you understand the subject but be prepared you will need a textbook and code. Just show up to classes and be on top of the canvas and you will pass.
10803,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"Prof Rizzo is my favorite professor of all time, just do your work and youll have an easy A.

10804,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1012,5.0,3.0,"You def have to work for the grade. Her test questions are based on her lectures, SO DONT SKIP HER CLASSES. Other than that, great professor and fun class, you will definitely LEARN."
10805,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,4.0,Professor Rizzo is one of the best professors Ive ever had! Her lectures are hilarious and entertaining.

She is very helpful and answers emails fast.
10806,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,SOP2772,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Rizzo is one of the best professors I've had my whole college career so far. She is hilarious! She makes the class light, but you HAVE to pay attention and complete all of the assignments. I took her for general psychology as well. She's very understanding and really knows what she's talking about. I learned a lot in human sexuality, take her!"
10807,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1020,4.0,3.0,"She is okay, but her tests are really hard"

The test it is all about the lecture, the way she lectures it is funny and catch your attention, I promise it wont be a boring class. If you really put effort into you will have a good grade."
10810,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,2.0,3.0,"very unclear to be honest. She's tough on attendance you have to be on time even if you're minute late and she's already done attendance youll still be considered late. You also have to calculate the grade for this class yourself, she will not do it for you and u will be left trying to figure out what's your grade the entire semester."
10811,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,4.0,"Professor Rizzo is really nice. She is very entertaining and she knows what she teaches. However, the online HW is super boring and there is a lot to do!!! Be ready to read the entire book, because the test are bases on the whole book and lectures. Test are heavy. Not an easy A for sure."
10812,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,4.0,"Every class is a lecture however she makes them fun and lets students ask questions to help us understand, she will also repeat something numerous times so we have it written down. The computer program seems to be really helpful in my opinion and Dr. Rizzo is a good teacher who cares about her students getting the most out of her class"
10813,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Rizzo is the best! Honestly she is so funny. Her class is lecture based and, there are quite a few assignments and quizzes. Everything you're taught in class will be on the tests. She makes her own tests and they're taken in class, some of the questions are funny. She may curve your grades at the end of the semester if she likes your class."
10814,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,3.0,3.0,"I had her during the cengage period so im not entirely sure how it will be for the next semester student. 4 homework assignments each chapter, sounds a lot but was really smooth. Funny during her lectures to make it relate able. Recap notes and you'll always be good, miss some notes and you are screwed. lots of extra credit opportunities."
10815,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,This course was 6 weeks. It was fast but Professor Rizzo covered everything. Pay close attention to her lectures and be sure to do the reading. Her tests are focused on her lectures. She made the course entertaining and relatable. There are some opportunities for extra credit.

10818,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,1.0,She is funny and amazing. I highly recommend you guys to take her for Psychology!!! Most of all you actually learn.
10819,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,SOP2772,5.0,3.0,"Professor Rizzo is a very caring professor. She really understands how to communicate effectively and clearly. She encourages questions and enjoys class participation. I took her for a Summer A semester so it FLEW by, so the workload was heavy, but can't blame the professor. It wasn't difficult though. Extremely manageable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
10820,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,4.0,Dr. Rizzo is one of the best professors I've experienced at Valencia. She is passionate and takes the time to discuss topics that may be confusing. She loves to talk about sex! The class consists of 4 exams (80%) and one project (20%). There are multiple opportunities for extra credit and to drop lowest test grade. Highly recommended!
10821,644166,Nancy,Rizzo,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,GEN1012,1.0,5.0,"Do yourself a favor and dont take this professor! Too much home work, tests are heavy. She grades very tough, and doesn't want to work with you."
10822,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,1.0,"Enjoyed this class, the easiest class of my life.  He seems strict at first but he is super friendly and funny. No homework just come to class, take notes and turn it in ( thats all you do for the rest of the semester). Tests (2 at the beginning of the semester) are open notes, easy fill in the blanks and for the final you just type one paragraph."
10823,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"Professor Donley is really amazing. He cares about his students and his teaching. I didn't think I would learn a lot but I did and I still remember his lectures. He teaches as if he's telling a story, very descriptive. Best teacher at Valencia !"
10824,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"Really great professor! There are about 2 to 3 lecture videos (1 hour each) a week. Watch the lectures (Which are surprisingly interesting), take notes, and answer the discussion questions. If you take quality notes during the lectures then you will have no problem answering the discussion questions."
10825,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.5,1.0,Very funny guy. He mostly lectures on the videos and not many quizzes but one written assignment at the end of the semester. I would take another humanities class with him instructing.
10826,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.5,1.0,"Dr. Donley is so passionate about humanities, and I would not have gotten an A with any other professor. I am a Biology major and this subject typically does not interest me but Dr. Donley made this class worthwhile. The workload is not much and test are also very easy if you take good notes. I would take him for all my Humanitirs courses!"
10827,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,2.0,4.0,"He expects you to check your email AT LEAST 3 times a day and yes, he emails you about every little thing. Even if it has nothing to do with you. His video lectures are long and pointless. To get a decent grade, you had to write MORE than 20 sentences to answer questions that were opinionated based. "
10828,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,5.0,1.0,an amazing class and I did learn a lot
10829,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2202,5.0,1.0,"All you have to do is listen and take good notes. He is very easy, and helpful. However, he's big on not having electronics out during class time. I don't like learning about history, I'm more of a math person, but he made it so interesting. I would take him again!!!;"
10830,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,4.0,1.0,"Your grade is based off your tests which are open note and usually just copypaste version of your notes. He makes history interesting. Very easy class and as long as you quote everything he says, you're golden. You don't even have to try in order to pass."
10831,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,3.5,2.0,"Easiest A of the century. If you come to every single class and take notes on everything he says youll be golden. He doesnt believe in homework or standardized tests, so the tests are discussion questions that youve taken notes on. He lets you use notes on the test and thats it. No reading. Just show up and listen and youll get an A. loved him"
10832,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,INTROTOHUMAN,4.0,1.0,Incredibly easy A if you participate and get all of the work done that he gives you in class. He doesn't give you any homework outside of class either.
10833,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM20THCEN,4.0,1.0,"I read all the comments.  I want to say that when you want to learn, then Dr. Donley is the professor that you want in your corner. He is not tough, he is straight forward &amp; his video lessons are incredible! You will learn about real history &amp; where we come from through his Humanities 20th Century course.  He is the best by far &amp; I love his class."
10834,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.5,2.0,Easy A as long you do the work. He does not play around with laziness. I took this class on-line and basically listened to video lectures and write about the material in the lecture. This class does including lots of writing and watching lectures that is mostly video clips. No test or quizzes and easy final.
10835,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,1020,5.0,1.0,"He is super easy. His class are very interesting because he explains like he lived the moment that he is talking about. He let you have your notes on the test, so it makes much easier everything. Just take his notes and you will pass with an A. He is very smart and he likes to make his class very funny and interesting."
10836,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,3.0,1.0,"i took this course for summer, class is super easy. Basically watch lectures on line and regurtigate for weekely exams. Topics are base on his belief. you will learn a good few facts about his lecture. beware of extra credit he says he will use to substitute but actually wont. I earned it and he disregarded total waste of my time for extra credit"
10837,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,1.5,2.0,"Really smart professor.  if you don't believe me, look at his web page, he'll tell you just how smart he is.  Course is videos of him teaching other students in a classroom. They probably had to repeat back to the prof what he said to get the easy A."
10838,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,5.0,2.0,"I took his class online for the summer and it was great! Yes he has an ""exam"" every week. I say ""exam"" because he asks you a couple questions in the discussion forum that you have to answer. That's it. If you watch the videos and take notes that is pretty much all you need for the questions. Super easy and the videos are entertaining!"
10839,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.0,2.0,Easy A. I took his class online for spring and I could definitely say his the best professor ever. I really enjoyed learning but in an entertaining way. I am going to take him again for Hum Greek/Roman.
10840,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,4.5,2.0,I absolutely LOVED his class!! I took him for intro to Humanities and I never looked forward and enjoyed going to a class before in my life. He lets you his notes on the test and he makes everything easy to understand and fun at the same time. It is almost impossible to fail. Although he hates cell phones in class and if seen with withdraw you.
10841,176857,Jeffrey,Donley,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,2.5,1.0,BEST TEACHER EVER!!! He gives u an outline of notes And than fills them in in his lectures!!! This was a 3 hour class and it was so interesting and he teaches so good that it didnt even feel like 3 hours sometimes we didn't want to leave lol and he gives open note tests!!! But he's very strict on grammar! Spell ur words correctly!!!
10843,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,INR2002,5.0,3.0,"This class is more about the structure of politics rather than the politics that is happening in the world at the moment. He will not talk about a certain leader but will teach you different ideologies being practiced around the world. If you want to talk about news, then join a political club at the college (if there isn't one then start your own)"
10844,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,1.0,2.0,"Loves to make sure everyone knows that he is above everyone else in intelligence. Cold calls in class is a daily thing. He doesn't like to be called ""sir""."
10845,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,INR2002,5.0,1.0,Simple.. do the work and you pass no problem with A++... Simple don't know how you can fail.. so many extra credits it's not even funny.
10846,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,INR2002,5.0,1.0,Loved it so easy.. Do the work easy A.. No joke...
10847,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,GOV2041,4.0,3.0,He's organized and offers lots of extra credit. Class is not mandatory but will help a lot when taking the notes for the test.
10848,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,INR2002,3.0,3.0,"I took the class online and I feel like this would have been a very easy class since the workload was not heavy however, he is a bit disorganized. The syllabus will say one set of due dates but blackboard will say something different. He also doesn't make tests or assignment submissions open until the day it is due."
10849,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,5.0,4.0,"Great professor he is lecture heavy but they do make you think. The text book is a must wont pass if you don't have it, lots of vocabulary words his test are on blackboard and range from 40 to 70 questions. Day of the test there is no class but test MUST BE TAKEN DURING CLASS HOURS! Be ready to discuss the chapters read and have group conversations"
10850,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,5.0,1.0,"He's really nice and respectful and he gives it to you straight about the government. He tries his best to make sure you have a fair chance at passing. If you just read the textbook you can pass, but it's easier just to go to class and listen to his lectures just stay awake or he'll tease you."
10851,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,GOVPOS2041,1.0,5.0,Horrible in every way. pops online assignments up midday due before midnight. class is death by gauge powerpoint in which he calls you out and sits there even when no one knows the answer. test and quizzes make no sense and even if you get a question right the test marks them wrong and he won't fix them. student beware
10852,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,5.0,3.0,"Excellent teacher. Those who complain are the ones who do not do the work. Do the work, study, do the extra credit, and show up to class, at the end of the semester you will be rewarded with the grade that you deserved through your work."
10853,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2140,1.0,3.0,"Worst decision of my college career. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. Horrible grammar mistakes on tests, and will try to critique your grammar/structure. Icredibly stupid discussions and almost absolutely no help from the professor. Terrible ""teacher"". You'll be on your own if you take this class. Absolutely sucks as a teacher."
10854,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,2.5,2.0,"I took him online and although he isn't very clear and organized on his assignments, if you have good organization you will be fine. We're halfway through the semester and I have yet to actually read a chapter of my book but still have an A. He is pretty quick with responses and always answers questions. You get out of it what you put into it."
10855,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,2.5,4.0,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!! I came into his class with a 3.75+ GPA through a year and a half and this class is by far the MOST difficult I had to take. It does not help that he cancels classes at the last second and gives you unexpected online assignments. I study at least 6 hours weekly and barely making a B at this point. SAVE YOURSELF!
10856,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,4.0,3.0,"He was a very good teacher, if you did not get an A- you didn't work hard enough. He was straight forward with what he expected and for those saying that he graded too harshly, didn't follow directions very well. The slight difficulty came from the tests, but getting an A overall with all the extra credit he handed out was easy. I recommend."
10857,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS20412282,5.0,2.0,"teacher is very helpful. hes big on making sure everyone gets a fair chance at passing the class. would so take a class with him again. if you ever can enjoy a class with him. ps. i did it as a military wife over in germany, with a 3year old and pregnant. so for any parent or full time worker. this class class should be a good one for you."
10858,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,2.0,5.0,"Very hard! Requires lots of reading, watching political programs, news, listening AM station for political talk shows! You will not have time for other classes! Quiz every class...horrible."
10859,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,1.5,3.0,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR ONLINE!!! He does not articulate his assignments clearly. When you email him for clarification, he just confuses you even more. Then he assigns a GROUP project for the online class, and if other members don't do their part YOUR grade suffers!Quizes &amp; multiple choice were easy, essays were graded harshly."
10860,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,5.0,1.0,Professor is strongly recommended I had a great experience class was hard yet easy it all depends on how ugh attention you pay in class and in your email extra credits are given!!
10861,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,1.0,5.0,"He was not a very good teacher. Does not give clear instructions, nothing is ever good enough for him. You will not receive an A."
10862,156938,D,Duncan,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Political Science,POS2041,1.5,5.0,I would not recommend him for the online course. I would liken the experience to having an automated professor. There was very limited teacher student interaction.
10864,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2004,1.0,4.0,"I would not recommend taking his class. He was absent for most of the semester, and he made the class boring. He's rude and waited until the last week of the semester to start grading stuff. Overall, this was my least favorite professor."
10865,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,2012PSY,1.0,3.0,"Professor Jennings is the worst professor I have had so far in college. Not academics-wise, but his character is unpleasant: he is unaccessible and can be very rude. I would highly recommend finding another professor for this course."
10866,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,Amazing Professor. His lectures are really great.
10867,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,4.0,"He is a great professor if you put in the work. He is very knowledgeable and good at what he teaches, but your grade is mostly based on 4 tests so if you are a bad test taker in a short amount of time it might be difficult to bring your grade back up."
10868,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,4.0,"Jennings is a great professor. However, don't take the class unless you're ready to learn and understand psychology. It's not enough to just read the textbook and show up to class. Good lectures, easy tests as long as you understand the material. Def taking him for DEP2004"
10869,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,3.0,"His lectures are hilarious and he uses example to help us understand. He doesn't go over all the chapters so you have to read the textbook. There are two parts to the test, online portion, and in-class portion. About 10 quizzes. Your grade will be dependent on how well you do on test. He drops your lowest test grade and quiz grade."
10870,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,2.0,5.0,He gives good lectures but his exams have little or nothing to do with it. The grades are awful and he doesnt justifies it or accept a discussion. Very disappointed
10871,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,1.0,4.0,"This PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE!!! Dont take his class. Test are 70% of your grade (4 test in total, 60 questions each, with a 60 min. time limit) You dont know your grade until the end, he doesnt teach you about the chapters until after taking the test (why teach me after?), and he makes you calculate your own grade. Definitely a self teach class."
10872,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,3.0,"I took him for developmental and general 2 years ago. He made me fall in love with psychology. Funny guy, visit his office hours! He does get off topic during class and you have to make up for it at home but if you like psychology you'll find him impeccable! Might seem cocky to some but he knows what hes talking about"
10873,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,He was an amazing professor I enjoyed the class . 4 exams out of the 16 week  with online quizzes due every week.  As long as you study and take the online quizzes your grade will be fine.
10874,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY101,1.0,3.0,He is the most horrible teacher I ever had. Very inappropriate jokes and doesn't care about his students. He feels like he's better than them.
10875,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,2.0,"Professor Jennings is one of my favorite professors! His lectures are always so inspiring and he is insanely hilarious. He has quizzes for every chapter but allows unlimited attempts. He allows students 4 hrs of absence, but it is unlikely that any student would want to miss his lectures in the first place. No final exam. TAKE HIM!!"
10876,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,2.0,3.0,"Professor doesn't put grades on Canvas until the end of the semester. Also, he drops your highest four grades. Overall, he is a tremendous professor but the fact he drops your four highest grades and doesn't put grades in canvas is something he needs to work on"
10877,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,2.0,2.0,This professor never posts your work on time so it messes with your whole schedule. The discussions are not well organized at all either not being posted when supposed to be. Also he doesn't show you your grade the whole time you're enrolled in his class. How am I supposed to improve?
10878,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,1.0,1.0,"DONT TAKE THIS CLASS online! He doesn't put your overall grade in, he puts the power points up after you take the quiz. He doesn't have all the assignments in at once, he'll put them up when they're due so you can't really plan for them. And when you email him, he is very rude and snappy. If you want to pass, just dont take this class."
10879,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,2.0,3.0,He doesnt show you your grade at all or grades you get on exams so if you dont like that dont take him. I put my final grade as a B- but Im just guessing because I have no idea what I got. He also posts lectures AFTER you take the quiz for them so get ready to use the book
10880,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,3.0,"I took professor Jennings for gen and dev psych. His lectures are life alterin;he will challenge every perception you have of this world and of yourself in such a beautiful way. I hung onto every word he said. He's a tremendous professor. He's by the syllabus, and you'll read alot, but he always offers extra credit and he's extremely reasonable."
10881,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSYCH,4.0,3.0,Dr. J is a great professor. The lectures are amazing and he gives great real life situations throughout. He always makes sure everyone understands. Quizzes are online and they are due BEFORE he talks about the chapters in class. Tests are kind of hard but if you actually read the chapter and take notes you should be fine. Highly recommend.
10882,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,4.0,2.0,"Very good professor, very laid back and not too much work. 10 question quizzes every week on the textbook chapter assigned and a couple of exams. Very engaging and interesting stories."
10883,570148,Sean,Jennings,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,1.0,5.0,You will fail his class
10885,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,Great professor. Her lectures are helpful and she clearly knows what she's talking about. Homework and test due almost every week on MyMathLab. Midterm and final aren't hard if you do the practice test and she recycles some questions.
10886,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,3.0,"Im a senior graduating in one semester and Ive had my fair share of professors, but she takes my place as the best. She explains things in a way that anyone can understand. She made calculus easy, I got an A in her class. Just pay attention to her lectures and you should be good. Hw is easy since she gives like 5 tries per problem."
10887,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1033C,5.0,2.0,"Labs are mandatory as well as time spent at lab.

10888,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,The best math professor you will ever have.
10889,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,2.0,4.0,Professor Segarra uses an online learning software for her classes. A lot of the time her lessons won't match up with what the online assignment is. The structure is not the same and the way the question is set up is barely recognizable to the notes. She also changes the due dates for assignments all the time which is stressful.
10890,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,5.0,3.0,Great professor! Not much homework which is all in MyMathLab. Gives partial credit on tests as long as you try the problems. Very friendly and responds quickly to emails and concerns. I recommend taking her!
10891,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033C,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Shorter, now Prof. Segarra (recently married) is amazing! I'm currently taking her for Int. Alg. Summer C, which is quicker pace, but it doesn't feel like it. Her lectures are long, but extremely useful. She's always willing to help you understand. Just keep up with HW (it's a lot) and you should be fine! I'm taking her again for fall! :)"
10892,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.5,2.0,"Prof. Shorter was super helpful! I was really nervous to take college algebra because I really didn't like math in high school, but she made it easy to understand! She helped me when I had questions and provided lots of resources to help us learn. I would definitely take her again!"
10893,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033,3.5,4.0,She teaches well but she's a little tough on grading. Very inflexible too so don't expect her to open a quiz for you if you missed it.  The lectures seemed very long and tedious at times.
10894,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAT1033,4.5,3.0,"I took her for intermediate algebra and she was great!  I'm taking her for college algebra.  She's clear and offers help.  Ask questions.  Stay on top of your work, DON'T GET BEHIND!  Lots of work but manageable.  She likes students to talk to classmates about problems you are working on in class."

10896,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2233,5.0,4.0,"She is very clear in lectures, and we usually do part of the HW in class. Her study guides tell you EXACTLY what will be on the test. They're short, and questions come straight from the HW. You won't be afraid to ask a questions because she always gives great, clear answers. Classes are definitely hard work, but an A is very manageable. Take her! "
10897,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1140,2.0,4.0,"I gonna be honest on this page since people are rating so highly, the class is very fast paced and you get superfluous work that doesn't count for a grade and you wont be able to take the tests or quizzes until you finish it every week. The lectures in class are fine but do not cover the more complex questions on hw just the basics not great :"
10898,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.5,3.0,"This class is loaded with topics, which is NOT to blamed on any instructor. Professor Shorter is always prepared for class, sets clear expectations, and helps you to be successful in the course. GO TO CLASS, KEEP UP WITH YOUR HW, and ask for help if you need it - basic college rules here! LOTS of help provided for Midterm and Final. Take her class!"
10899,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,3.5,4.0,"Shes always there to help all of her students but her lectures are so long. She starts the exact minute the class starts and ends at the exact time. During the whole semester my class never got out early and every minute of her time is used to do some sort of math. Be prepared for the long boring lectures, and the hard online work."
10900,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,COLLEGEALGEBRA,4.5,2.0,She is sweet and helpful and her lectures are long but very helpful. The only thing i hate is the mastery points. There is way to many things to do in this class.  But she is a great teacher and ready to help!
10901,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.5,4.0,I have no idea why people gave her a good rating. If you are not already good at math.. do not take her. I learned nothing. She teaches so fast. So many sections in one day.. And the amount of things you have on your test are crazy. How do you remember all those concepts? Her tests look nothing like the massive amount of HW she gives.

10903,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,4.0,Before I took Shorter I thought I was terrible at math and now I'm SUPER CONFIDENT IN IT!!!! I took Shorter for Intermediate AND College Algebra because she is so fantastic at explaining each of the concepts. She even briefly reviews topics as refreshers just in case you have forgotten so the new stuff is easier to understand. Definitely reccomend
10904,1224730,Nichole,Segarra,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,4.0,seemed like it was going to be easy at first. She goes WAY to fast. I mean WAY to fast. The first quiz was long after the beginning of the semester so we learned so much who even remembers? I honestly don't think she is a good math teacher. She is smart but still. I would not recommend her unless you are already good at math &amp; dont mind a ton of HW
10906,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,"Professor Warren seems very passionate about what he is doing. You may ask anything and he if he does not know the answer, he'll do his research and come back with an answer for that. Just took his class for a credit and I actually liked it and would take it again. Assignments are pretty easy too."
10907,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM1020,5.0,1.0,"I love this Professor, he make his class easy enough so everyone can pass.

He only give 5 assignments, no homework, no testes."
10908,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,5.0,1.0,Super kind and clarifies grading system a well as assignments.

10909,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,3.0,4.0,He is unbelievablely boring. He knows what he is talking about but no one cares in his class. He is the most boring professor you will take. Hell snap sometimes on students for whispering. His papers are super complex and it feels like youre writing a thesis for a PhD. He lets you fix up the first 2 papers. Other then thats hes ok
10910,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM1020,4.0,1.0,He was so unique and he definitely has more information than he can talk about in one course. He is very clear with the grading. Only 5 assignments and no exams. Very easy but show up because attendance is mandatory.
10911,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,MYTH2310,2.0,4.0,"He was one of the most boring professors I had. He did give 4 papers and reading. He seems to know what he is talking about, but he is very boring. Oh he has a cell phone and laptop policy, if you use them and catches you using them for not class related, then you fail automatically. That wasn't the problem. He was just very boring."
10912,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,5.0,3.0,There are only four assignments in this class with plenty of opportunities for extra credit. The professor gives good feedback on what can be improved and allows students to redo the first two assignments for a better grade if they choose to. Overall a good professor.
10913,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM1020,4.0,3.0,"He is a good professor. No homework other than reading. Prepare to read a lot, and be able to discuss at class. No tests or exams, the grades are all from the papers."
10914,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,MYTH2310,4.0,4.0,"I took his Mythology class in West Campus. I was amazed how much knowledge he has and how he likes the subject. I like the class because it was only 4 papers. (hard papers) but only 4. No homework other than reading. Very easy going. If you do what he says, you'll pass. You can re-write the work after he gives you feedback. Very understanding."
10915,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,3.0,3.0,"This class was iffy, he wasn't bad but at the same time he talked from class start to class finish. There was only 4 assignments which basically MAKE OR BREAK YOUR GRADE, luckily he allows you to rewrite your papers. Not much reading for homework but when it is assigned it's a lot and the book is huge. Overall, not a bad professor."
10916,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,2.0,4.0,"He is super boring. He likes to test out things with the class that kind of help writing papers but its takes time. When it comes to grading, he is super strict. Oh if you even use your phone or laptop in class, he will automatically fail you from the class. His lectures are really boring. I just wanted to fall asleep in his class."
10917,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2210,5.0,3.0,Super cool teacher! He loves talking to his students and getting their opinion! Super helpful with his essays. My class had three essays and one small assignment. DO NOT DO THEM LAST SECOND! He does give you good feedback and gives you a chance to rewrite your essay to get a better grade. I'm taking him again next semester for another HUM class!
10918,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,5.0,2.0,"Bob is awesome! He can lecture like there is no tomorrow (in a good way).  There were only 2 papers through the whole semester, and he lets you rewrite them if you didn't get the grade you wanted.  He provides a lot of good feedback, and will challenge you to think critically about the subject material.  Take him if you want a chill professor."

10920,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,4.0,2.0,"Cool guy, he's kind of a hippie. If you are just looking for a relatively simple class where you just get an easy A this is a great class to take, but if you want to be engaged and entertained the whole time this isn't for you. He plays a lot of movies most classes and you have to fight to not fall asleep. But he is a good guy, just get to know him"
10921,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2220,4.0,3.0,"He is a good professor, gives clear feedback and will let you rewrite your essays. His assignments are very well explained and you will know what he expects of you. Not an easy A, you have to show you understand the content. However, he does ramble and mumble in class a lot, if you get distracted/daydream for a few seconds you will get lost"
10922,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2310,4.0,4.0,"4 essays and participation/attendance are the only things that make up your grade. The essays aren't difficult if you do the reading, pay attention, and ask questions. You NEED to read in order to understand lectures and to write the essays. You also are able to rewrite 3 out of the 4 essays for a better grade."
10923,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM020,5.0,3.0,"One of the best professors I have ever had! So helpful, gives you all the material you need to succeed and the class is easy. I got an A and we only had to write 2 essays throughout the entire semester. I learned so much and enjoyed his class, he makes discussions fun and really cares about students. He will help you understand things. Take him!!!"
10924,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,MYTH2310,3.0,1.0,Read the textbook and pay attention in class and you'll pass. 2 essays a 5 page paper and a 3 three page paper plus 2 in class assignments are what the grade consisted of. Show up to class and don't fall asleep.
10925,466196,Bobby,Warren,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,HUM2234,1.0,5.0,"Regret taking him!! Very tough grader, you'll be surprised at your grade thinking you did great on a paper. He should definitely be your LAST RESORT!! If you take him good luck."
10927,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,CALC2,4.0,3.0,"I did not pay attention in his class, which is why I received a grade of D in his class."
10928,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,CALC2,3.0,3.0,"I received a grade D in a class which was a Gorden rule, I can write over here how the professor failed his student, but I am not a child who will blame my lack of attention paying in the class on a professional doing his job correctly."
10929,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2313,4.0,3.0,"Some of these reviews are saddening. I was taking this professor during the covid-19 crisis, so the class transitioned into an online class. He is a caring and helpful professor as long as you took the time to reach out to him. He told me I was one of the few people that reached out and everyone went M.I.A. Really great guy and I recommend him."
10930,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2313,5.0,4.0,"I'll just leave this anecdote - my study group was struggling with the work on a take home exam (he gave permission to tackle hard problems as a team). We texted him a question and he responded by jumping onto our facetime call and helping us understand a tough concept. If you work hard, he will do everything he can to help you learn and pass."
10931,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,Worst teacher ever. Does nothing to help
10932,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,1.0,5.0,If you don't understand what he's teaching then you're out of luck. He doesn't stop to explain. Had to drop and take with someone else.
10933,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2313,1.0,4.0,Don't even try. Save yourself.

There was only 3 tests and a final plus frequent homework that you need to do in order to pass the class. Do not skip class because it will significantly effect your grade."
10935,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2233,4.0,4.0,Very well structured course. It was a tough class but he's a great professor.

10937,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2233,5.0,3.0,Math isn't my thing but this professor explain things so well. Don't be afraid to ask any questions you might-he is very encouraging and doesn't mind repeating things as many times as it takes for the class to get it.
10938,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311H,5.0,4.0,"By FAR the BEST professor I have ever taken, He WILL CHALLENGE you, he will make you work so hard for your class, but remember if you are taking higher level classes you need to know math VERY WELL! HE will give you the foundation to succeed in any career field. DO NOT skip class, and do not think he is an easy A, but work for it, its worth it."
10939,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,3.0,"Ok-hear me out! don't take him If you don't need Calc 2. Prepare yourself to study hard. this is calculus, not the easy algebra class. I learned a lot in this class more than I did in any of my previous math classes (combined). I feel confident going to calculus 2."

I struggled a lot during Calc I, and he never gave up on me. He genuinely cares about his students, is very funny, and very honest and fair. I was sad I didnt need any more math courses because I wish I took take another class with him."
10942,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,"Great teacher. Sometimes a little impatient when we don't recall trig and algebra, so make sure you review that! He's really smart and caring, and he really wants us to pass (so long as we work for it). He gives out homework and practice tests that really help when it comes to the actual exams as well."
10943,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2233,5.0,3.0,"Took his hybrid business calc class and it was one of the best maths I've taken in a while. He goes the extra mile to make sure his students pass as long as we put in the work too. Very fair when it comes to grading. His pretests look very similar to the tests so you know what to study for. Just make sure you come to class, take notes."
10944,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2311,5.0,4.0,"Best Math Professor I've ever had! He is so smart and caring about his students. Always willing to help and looking for accommodations for the class. Well-respected, educated, and he is hilarious! I took him for MAC 2311 (Spring 2018) and I had to take him again for MAC 2312 (Summer 2018). Three exams, a final, and quizzes. Take him if you can!!!!!"
10945,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312H,5.0,4.0,"He is truly gifted at teaching. I took his class a year ago. But I wanted to share that take him if you could, I did not feel stress with his class and I grasped the concepts and techniques well which is benefiting me for my Physical Chemistry class now. I'm so glad I've got to learn from him. He is a GENIUS."
10946,283203,Hatim,Boustique,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2312,5.0,4.0,I wish Prof. Boustique could teach me every future math class I will take. He is one of the best professors I've ever had. He explains everything so clearly and intuitively; he made difficult material understandable. Make sure to do the homework and ask questions. This class will require a lot of studying but is well worth it!

Almost everyone I knew in his class also withdrew. I don't know how he got hired as a teacher. He does not TEACH, JUST SHOW."
10980,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.5,4.0,He is a great professor! even though I fail my 2 first test I think I can pass this class. He assignes just enough homework but not as much as other professors. Passing this class depends on the effort of the student.I personally love the system he uses.
10981,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"We get it, he's not a good teacher. Here's why: 1.Poor explanations and intros to lessons. 2. Bad step by step break downs of problems. 3.Bad methods of practice for the class (KADS, Online videos.)4. Lame jokes."
10982,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,BUSCALC,1.0,4.0,I cant believe hes still a math professor. He has no idea how to teach. Take any other profesor.
10983,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,You have to teach yourself everything because he has no idea how to teach math. Dont take him unless you want to fail.
10984,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"Dont take him unless you want to fail. He is a crappy professor and should consider getting a new job, because obviously being a math professor isn't his strong point."
10985,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"DONT TAKE! No textbook. You copy the problems off the board and hope you can figure them out later at home. The teacher was not helpful at all. After failing my first test I went to him for help. He only told me to time myself while I practice the problems. Needless to say, I dropped the class."
10986,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,4.0,HORRIBLE TEACHER! Do not take this professor unless you don't mind teaching yourself. I cant explain how bad he is. I only took his class because it was the only math class available for the time I wanted. If that happens to you just wait until the next term.
10987,232085,Justus,Frazier,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC2233,1.0,5.0,Isn't everything you've read so far enough? DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. DO NOT. DO NOT take his online classes. DO NOT. Unless you enjoy teaching YOURSELF. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID

10998,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2005,4.0,3.0,"She is considerate but expects you to put in effort into her class and the education occupation. The 20 SL Hours are a bit tedious, there are weekly or biweekly quizzes, 1 chapter presentation with a partner, and 1 ""in-class simulation"" presentation. Sometimes there is random hw but she gives 3-4 extra credits and brings snacks every now and then."
10999,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2005,2.0,1.0,Shes not very good at problem solving she just declare sthat what you are/aren't doing is alarming or disappointing. in you don't live near east campus do not take her because she doesn't seem to get that some of her students live in kissimmee and cant meet with her every week. She is super nice face2face. The book teaches you alot about u as a edu

Always accessible outside of class, and is willing to help you if you ask. Definitely take her class, learn from er treasure box (you'll find out when you take her.) 40+ years of experience, and very awarded. Read about her before, she is awesome."
11001,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2005,3.0,1.0,"Dr. Qadri is not clear with her instructions and claims that the lack of instruction creates more creative assignments. If you can get past her disorganization, this class is actually easy if you have time. No test just quizzes, one chapter presentation, 20 service learning hours, and a final presentation. Good luck!"
11002,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2005,2.0,4.0,"Although this class is fairly easy, it was absolutely ridiculous. This professor was extremely unclear in every assignment. It felt as if we were a class of 4th graders.  She was always blaming students for every little thing, including her projector issues &amp; her literally grading a quiz wrong. Wont take this Professor again and dont recommend!"
11003,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2005,5.0,3.0,"Professor Qadri has a very easy to follow syllabus and assignment list. She responds to emails very quickly and is always willing to help. I would definitely take her because the course load was easy to manage. Our final was a power point, including proof of our 20 service learning hours, and that was it."
11004,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2005,5.0,3.0,Such a kind and understanding professor. She gives you every opportunity known to pass and the class is a piece of cake. Taking her again next semester.

She's just a little unorganized or it just seems that way with how classes went. All in all pleasant professor and better than many. (Offers extra credit!)
11006,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2005,4.0,2.0,"I had Prof Qadri for EDF 2005. She's a little unorganized since she teaches 10+ classes, so it's understandable. If you want to contact her, send a message via Canvas since it shows what class you're in &amp; she replies mainly on there. Her instructions can be confusing so be sure to have some office hours with her. She's very nice &amp; inspirational!"
11007,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2085,3.0,4.0,very unorganized
11008,238668,Yasmeen,Qadri,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Education,EDF2085,5.0,4.0,"What can I say, Professor Qadri knows her stuff. If you are not quiz savvy extra credit and reflection is available for everyone. You will only Pass the class if you are really interested in learning and willing to put your best foot forward. Do all the assignments, ask questions, and complete Service Learning hours on time and you will pass."

11012,1952448,Robert,Furrow,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,1.0,Although I didn't like that I had to take this class Professor Furrow was amazing. He genuinely cares about his students and he is always willing to help. As long as you keep up with the work you would have to try to NOT get an A. There is weekly extra credit if you go on his zoom office hours and ask him a question. Take this class from him.

Every Friday he hosts a Q/A for 10 extra credit points. Through this Q/A you can ask questions about your future that he definitely has an answer for. Professor furrow is a very helpful person and has your future in mind.
11023,1952448,Robert,Furrow,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,5.0,1.0,Great teacher ! There when you need help he also grades fast and is a wonderful teacher to take online
11024,1952448,Robert,Furrow,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Student Success,SLS1122,4.0,1.0,"I would recommend taking this course with this professor. There's about 1-2 assignments a week, and if you read through the module they aren't very challenging. Also, if you have any questions he has an optional zoom call he does every week where he can answer your questions, and he gives you extra credit."

He's what a professor should be. I have him for Leadership as well and plan to take him for the Capstone class. If you have the chance to take him for anything dont hesitate to do so. Amazing professor.
11033,1311366,Jerrid,Kalakay,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Strategies For Success,MAN3240,5.0,3.0,"Dr. K has been one of the most amazing professors I have ever taken in all my time at Valencia, I never felt the dread of going to class like I do for others. He always greeted everyone with a smile and good energy for class. The class is part of the business program so there is writing involved but Dr. K will work with you and help you if needed."
11034,1311366,Jerrid,Kalakay,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Strategies For Success,MAN3240,5.0,1.0,"Dr. K is an amazing person. Self-described as shy, but engaging. Good lectures but too much reading off of slides (we can read). Fun activities. Not good at responding to emails. Have an issue? Talk to him after class. Assignments/tests are basically book reports: not challenging and do not promote critical thinking, being just a waste of time."
11035,1311366,Jerrid,Kalakay,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Strategies For Success,MAN3353,4.0,2.0,"I took this class online. Professor provides the course text therefore you save $$. weekly discussions, a writing exercise, and at the end a portfolio paper.

11057,233559,Lewyn,Graubner,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1114,4.5,3.0,I took this class as an individualized learning course.  I did not know this signing up for the course!  Thank goodness math is my strongest subject because I would have had a rough time otherwise.  The professor was very willing to help the students.

11066,233559,Lewyn,Graubner,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.0,3.0,"I've had my fair share of math professors at VCC. Take Mr. Graubner and you won't be sorry. I've not only learned so much about math in a short summer semester but learned to appreciate math. Coming from someone who rejoices in the fact that my major requires 2 math classes..take my advice: He is hilarious, cares about his students and the material"
11067,233559,Lewyn,Graubner,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,1.0,5.0,"doesn't seem enthusiastic about teaching so his class becomes extremely tiresome. Regardless of how nice he is, he can tend to make problems confusing as he doesn't show any steps on how to arrive at the solutions. It feels like a waste of time attending class when I haven't learned a thing &amp; could do a much better job teaching myself the material."
11068,233559,Lewyn,Graubner,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,3.0,"Professor Graubner is a great, knowledgeable, and dedicated teacher. Take his class! He gives plenty of extra credit problems and you get more extra credit solving problems on the board at the beginning of class. You also can use 3x5 note cards on the exams.  Best way to pass MAC 1105 is to take it with an SL present."
11069,233559,Lewyn,Graubner,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,4.5,2.0,"Prof Graubner is the kindest and most considerate professor I have ever had in my 5 year stint in school. He knows exactly what students need to succeed. He goes above and beyond for everyone and is genuine in his attempts. There is a lot of online work, but it's not overwhelming. There are tons of opportunities for points in his class. TAKE HIM!"
11070,233559,Lewyn,Graubner,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Mathematics,MAC1105,5.0,2.0,He is the kindest math teacher I have ever meet! He made everything in math relate to real life. He actually cares if you understand...not just about getting through the book. I am actually LEARNING math for the first time ever! Take him if you want a professor that cares.
11072,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,4.0,"Professor Schorsch is very VERY knowledgable in Psychology and explains terms easy enough for a beginner to understand and thoroughly comprehend. His emails to students are always super long, and I think that goes to show how much he cares. He also gives feedback at like 2:30AM and is always working, so he is responsive. Learned A LOT, best teacher"
11073,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"Professor Derek has many perks. He offers many extra credit opportunities, the work is lightweight, the papers are quite simple and short, and his personality is the cherry on top. He checked in on us regularly and made the goofiest jokes. Overall, he's probably the best professor I have ever had! 10/10 recommend his class!"
11074,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,3.0,"I really enjoyed this class, the only weekly assignments are to complete the smartbook, and then there are discussion posts before the exams. He has 2 papers that he does grade tough on but he gives more than enough time to do them. He sends a lot of emails but if you read them there might be extra credit options hidden in them."
11075,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,1.0,"Where do I begin? Professor Derek Schorsch is one of the best professors I have ever had. Just read the book, do the discussion, and complete the labs. I got a B+ for his class because I didn't really follow the instructions for the papers (only 3 papers for the whole semester), I wish I could go back in time to get that A+"
11076,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,2.0,"Prof. Schorsch was awesome! His class was really organized and I felt like he engaged just enough to to be involved but didnt hit being annoying. We usually did 2 homework lessons a week, took a test every 4 or 5 chapters and wrote 2 papers. Just do the work and youll get an A, maybe a B. Highly recommend!"
11077,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,2.0,3.0,"I didnt take psychology to be bored, yet here I am regretting taking this class. You read and write papers. He picked the least interesting chapters in the book for us to read.. this class is the worst. I'm kicking myself for taking it."
11078,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,"I took Professor Schorsch's Psychology class online during the short, ""Summer A"" term. Even though the class was fast-paced, Professor Schorsch kept the workload &amp; tests manageable. I enjoyed this class a lot, and I also liked the fact that Professor Schorsch encourages peer interaction. Don't even hesitate to take Professor Schorsch!!"
11079,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"This class was taken online, but the presentations he included were very well done. He's got a great sense of humor, and seems like a really cool dude. He's very passionate about psychology, and is always very involved in our class discussions. If you read his slides, read the book, and then complete the hw, the exams are super easy."
11080,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,2.0,This professor is among the very best there is at Valencia. He really knows what hes doing and does a great job at teaching his students. He uses modern techniques and analogies that really explain the content. Theres ALOT of extra credit and he is not a harsh grader. He really cares about his students. Hes a cool guy! Definitely recommend :)
11081,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,4.0,3.0,"We learned so much and had very cool conversations in class! I could tell that not being able to cover as much material as he wanted to during class kind of annoyed him since we only had about an 1 hour and 15. There were 2 essays, and then every week: an online quiz, learn smart modules, and a discussion board. Do your work and you will pass!"
11082,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,2.0,Love loved him! He went beyond everything to make sure his students had a clear understanding and simply made everything fun! He would use real life examples about every topic to help grasp a better understanding. I would 100% take him again if given the chance. Easy easy tests if you pay attention and do the work. Presentations given but easy! :-)
11083,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,best professor ever! what he teaches in class is exactly what the tests are about. He gives extra credit to whoever assist to his events (almost every week) and write a short paragraph about it. We had to do four easy papers that if you showed to him before the due date he will correct every mistake and you'll get an easy A. Study from his notes!
11084,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,1.0,I took his hybrid class so everything was done at home but he was very kind and funny. His lectures are always so intriguing and light. He gives good feedback and i definitely recommend!
11085,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY1101,1.0,1.0,Derek schorsch is a teacher who does not give chances or extra credit even if it is a month before the class ends. He is a horrible teacher and judges you if your on your phone and uses it against you. Do not take this class and stay away.
11086,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"I took the 6-week General Psychology class with Prof. Schorsch. He makes the class very easy if you do the work on time, and actually read the information provided in the textbook. I also learned a lot in this class, much more than I originally anticipated. I looked forward to the readings and discussions. Recommend 10/10."
11087,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,4.0,"Professor Schorsch may be my favorite professor at Valencia, yet. His curriculum is organized, exhaustive, and pleasantly educational. As a teacher, he excels at being communicative, accessible, and kind. His methods make the content approachable and easily comprehensible. The book is great, but, he creates a lot of his own (amazing) content, too.7"
11088,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,PSY2012,5.0,3.0,"I enjoyed this class, Professor Schorsch made the class interesting with the stories he told that related to the material. Many would say that the tests were hard, which I agree with, but I mainly used his printed notes to study and passed every test with good scores; however, some should use the textbook if they're unsure. Papers are not bad too."
11089,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,3.0,Derek is so nice and funny. His lectures are always very interesting and you will learn so much listening to him. I got a B on the first paper and an A on the second one. He is very clear about what he expects and lays it all out on the table when it comes to his point system . Be sure to show him rough drafts so he can help you perfect it.
11090,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,4.0,I wrote both papers for Professor Schorsch a couple days before they were due Did both in one sitting at 8 hours a piece. Yes he is a tough grader. I wrote an absolute gem and got an A- for very unclear reasons after dropping 1 pages of neatly organized information. if youre a good writer like me youll do fine. test avg 98 9.5 out of 10
11091,1163420,Derek,Schorsch,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Psychology,DEP2004,5.0,2.0,"Derek is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He's hilarious, loves teaching, and really makes the subject interesting even if have no interest in it. I took him for Intro to Pysch and Developmental Psych and both classes I received an A! Take his class, you won't regret it!"
11093,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BIO1010C,5.0,3.0,"Professor Malmos has a genuine zeal for Biology that sparks excitement in students to learn the concepts more in-depth. He's not an easy professor, but he's very present and available for students to come to him with questions. If you put in the work, you'll do well in his course. He is always willing to help his students understand and excel."
11094,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BIO1010C,1.0,4.0,Only take his class if you want to teach yourself biology!!!! He give NO clear direction. He adds to your confusion with techincal terms. I had the take online because of COVID. He does not have his module in until Monday while you work is due by Friday like at 6pm or 10pm. He changes the times. He does use record any lectures. Beware!!!
11095,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BIO1010C,1.0,5.0,Wow where do i start.. he has been the worst professor ive ever had. He lectures by literally reading from the textbook and elaborating slightly we only get homework about 4 times the whole semester. He doesnt give one clear study guide for us to study for the exam. The whole class had to go to tutoring bc it was so bad. Just avoid it at all cost
11096,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1010C,2.0,5.0,"I didn't like his teaching style. I used to be very good is Science, but every lecture he would pull up the textbook and read off it. There were no assignments to check your understanding, and the tests were fairly hard. He would never tell you what things would be on the test, so good luck reading like 4 chapters, and only 25% being on the test."
11097,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BIO1011,2.0,4.0,"I really like and respect Prof. Malmos. He's fun, and his lectures are really interesting. That being said, I took Biology 2 with him, and it felt disorganized. There was so much information, and what to concentrate on was not always made clear. This particular class felt like it was all over the place and I was disappointed."
11098,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BIO1011,2.0,5.0,"aid back &amp; a nice guy that tries to make corny jokes in class BUT This class was very tough not only for me but majority of my class mates bc of the way he teaches. Don't ask questions because you will be even more confused then before, you WILL be teaching urself and take notes/highlight things that are repeated in lectures, hw questions r on test"
11099,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1005,3.0,2.0,Most of the time he is just unclear. Ive taken biology about 4 times (I hate science) and some of the things he talked about I had never heard of before. The vocabulary he usues is irrelevant. The only reason I passed is because I have taken biology before. The textbook doesnt help. The homework is literally the same as the exams.
11100,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1010,5.0,3.0,"An Awesome Professor! He tries extra hard to relate the Biology content to what you are knowledgeable in, he is a fantastic teacher to have and wish he could teach more classes. Also wish more professors out there were like he is, as more students would pass."
11101,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BIO1010,2.0,3.0,Tests are made up of the homework questions. Grades are not put in till final grades are viewable. He tries to have a sense of humor. Doesn't check attendance that much. Tends to get off topic. You will be teaching yourself.
11102,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1005,3.0,4.0,"I'll preface this by saying that Mr M is very kind and funny. BUT if you're not strong in science, he isn't the prof for you. Lectures can easily go over your head, so it is vital to read the textbook. You go over hw, which is KEY to passing tests! You don't really have to show up for class, only test and hw days. He doesn't enter grades in CANVAS."
11103,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1010C,2.0,4.0,"If you can't teach yourself, he's not for you. If you like structure, powerpoints, and knowing what to take notes on, he's still not for you. Going to class is sometimes a waste of time but for sure read the book ahead of time because lectures in class are completely unrelated to the actual content we should learn. He puts in grades @ the last min."
11104,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1005,1.0,4.0,"Tagged Tough Grader since he never hands assignments/tests back or posts grades - I had no idea how I was doing until final grade released a week before graduation - heart attack. Though he's kind and tries to make class fun by humour, he spends all time on something unrelated to material. Attending class wastes time better spent studying alone."
11105,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1005,4.0,2.0,"Professor Malmos is very nice and has a ton of corny humor. His Biological Science class is an easy A. You will be lost during some of his lectures ,but just ask questions and he will personally explain it to you in a way you can understand. This is the perfect class to take to get your science credit if you are not a science or med major."
11106,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1005,4.0,2.0,"Keith Malmos may not be the best public speaker in a classroom but he is very kind, rarely checks attendance, and is pretty lenient on grading tests. His test questions are straight from his homework assignments word-by word. I don't recommend going to every class because he reads off the textbook and tends to constantly digress from the subject."
11107,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1010C,5.0,1.0,loves you gives you everything you need to learn i love this professor will to take care of you
11108,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BIO1010C,3.0,3.0,kinda dorky but nice. doesn't do learnsmart which is great. makes his own homework which is similar to the tests. the lab practical is cake if you actually pay attention in lab. our final was take home so another great thing. my second time taking bio and im glad it wasnt hard like the first time.
11109,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1010C,1.0,5.0,"I already took biology in my country's highschool. As I know everything he explains, I can clearly tell this professor doesn't know how to teach. He focus in one fact and keeps explaining it for the rest of the time while leaving all other facts. Don't take him."
11110,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,BSC1010,5.0,4.0,He's very helpful and will do anything for you to pass the class.
11111,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,1010C,3.0,3.0,"He is a really nice guy. His teaching maybe wasn't the best, for he just kind of went with the flow and at the beginning of the semester he went off on tangents a lot. Sometimes he focuses too long on things that maybe didn't need that much attention. He did give us study guides and the tests would use the same questions. He doesn't post grades."
11112,199176,Keith,Malmos,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Biology,1010C,1.0,4.0,"Malmos is a really good guy honestly, very nice but if you do not excel in AP BIO in high school or biology period you are going to have a super difficult time. He goes off topic very often and does not answer questions, he just talks around them. I would NOT recommend someone to take him."
11114,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EDG2001,5.0,1.0,"The class was one credit course, she utilized a site called ""Test camp"" Dr. Karen was very polite and clear. If you are having bad week she will reach out to you, she also allowed some makeups for the work if you needed. The purpose was not too fail and forget, but to learn and actually be prepared for tomorrow. You Rock Dr. Cowden."
11115,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EDG2001,5.0,2.0,"Had a good experience with her. Clear on grading, grades on time, responds quickly and politely."
11116,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,REA0017C,1.0,1.0,"DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU DONT HAVE TO. by far the worst reading teacher. she is NOT clear on directions. Her attitude is ridiculous for a professor, especially a beginners class for first time college students going into these classes. She is a know it all type class act fail. I would never recommend her and hope she leaves Valencia and goes elsewher"
11117,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,REA0017C,1.0,5.0,This lady is a nasty woman. She stated that I plagiarized in her class with no proof. I would NEVER take this professor ever again due to her attitude and not knowing what she is even teaching. She is disrespectful in every email and comment she makes. This class is so easy but she makes it so hard. Please be aware of this professor.
11118,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,ENC0027,3.0,2.0,"Somtimes, she is rude when she replies your email. I dont think that she grades you depend clearly on rubrics. Intructions are confusing sometimes. Anyway, it's still easy to get A."
11119,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EEC2732,5.0,3.0,"Professor Cowden was an amazing professor, easily the best I have had. She is very caring and compassionate regarding your well-being, very easy to contact and responds very quickly no matter the time. As for the work, if you purchase the text and read the chapters, the work is very easy. Typical discussions and quizzes, 3-4 essays."
11120,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,ENC0001,3.0,4.0,"We focus the majority of our time in class on how to revise our papers. We only had two essays last semester, and Professor Cowden grades strictly from the rubric. There are Peer review sessions in class and discussions on Canvas. Take this class if you want to become a better writer. Not an easy A."
11121,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EEC2732,4.0,4.0,"I took this class during Summer B (2-month class). The professor is very passionate and caring. There are many assigments throughout the week but they are interesting. The professor is tough on grading bc she wants everyone to succeed and learn in her class. She will reward hard-working students when she sees it, which is very motivational."
11122,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,MUS2011,4.0,4.0,Challenging and fair Professor. Really gets you to look at your work critically with honest feedback.

11124,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,ENC0027,5.0,2.0,This instructor was amazing. I enjoy taking this class and learned a lot. I would love to choose this instructor again for another English class.
11125,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,MUE2211,5.0,2.0,She is a great tacher who is always ready to help you and give constructive feedback on your work. She gives options for the assignments you would like to do and provides a fun and engaging classroom.
11126,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EAP0420C,4.0,4.0,"The classes are interesting and fun, but dont forget you have to do your homework to pass the class. She tries really hard to make sure everyone understands the subject."
11127,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,ENC002,4.0,4.0,SHES A GOOD TEACHER MAKES YOU WORK FOR YOUR GRADES WHICH IS GOOD AND SHE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR IF YOU NEED HELP
11128,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,ENC002,4.0,3.0,Professor Cowden is a great teacher she does take the time to read your papers and gives you quality feed back
11129,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,ENC002,5.0,4.0,"I felt overloaded by all the homework but then again it is an advanced class. Great professor, gives great feedback, very accessible."
11130,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,ENC0027,5.0,5.0,I absolutely enjoyed taking this course with professor Cowden as she is very responsive and helpful when it comes to narrowing down the detail for the homework or discussion. I would be happy to take another class with professor Cowden in the near future.
11131,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EDF2005,1.0,2.0,"She requires you to purchase the textbook online. The directions to her assignments are not clear! If you are not on top of her as in constantly emailing her and going to her office hours than you can expect to struggle or be lost! Prof. Cowden gives good feedback when it comes to your assignments. Grading is pretty easy. BEWARE of ""pop tests""!"
11132,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EAP1520,5.0,4.0,"Karen is a really good teacher. It's a very interactive class. Her explanations are really good and she gives a lot of opportunities to get a good grade, but you need to work for it. You'll need to read a lot and do a lot of homework and project; however, she's such a good teacher that makes all of this easy."
11133,1015999,Karen,Cowden,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Reading,EDF2130,5.0,4.0,"It was a pleasure taking this class. The student can expect clear expectations, practical assignments, and thorough feedback."

11140,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP1640,5.0,2.0,"Best professor I've ever had coming from someone who hated Grammar and reading classes. I took both with him, and not only I loved his classes, I learned so much that I am amazed. He's extremely helpful, allows you to turn in work late, tech savvy, knowledgeable, has very interesting lectures, and lots of extra credit. Want to learn? Take him!"
11141,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP16201640,5.0,2.0,Best professor!!!
11142,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP1640,1.0,5.0,The worst class I've ever had. Just think twice before taking his class.
11143,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP1640,1.0,5.0,"I haven't the chance to choose my professor, but if I did I would never take his classes."

11145,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,SLS1570,5.0,1.0,"Easiest class I've ever taken. Attendance is mandatory but missing a few days won't hurt too bad. Cool guy who wants to personally know his students, however, a bit too closely though. The class he taught was perfect for what he loves to do and he's always enthusiastic about it. Great guy. Always giving out ways to use technology to help."
11146,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP1620,1.0,5.0,"His class is very difficult and a lot of homework without explanation, don't take this class."
11147,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,1620C,3.0,2.0,He's a good guy. I realised its not a good idea to take both reading &amp; writing classes with him. He seems exhausted sometimes maybe because of his workload. But its worth taking one class from him. He is there for you if you want to learn more and get good grades.
11148,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP1640,1.0,5.0,"This guy is a joke. He tries to over complicate everything with technology and forgets the fact that he is an English professor. He should focus more on the course content and less with technology.

He misses half the classes and demands what she doesn't comply. He has been THE WORST PROFESSOR I have had ever in my student life.
11150,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP1620,4.5,4.0,"He is not your usual professor. If he sees effort he will help you to get through it. If you are a lazy ass and don't do the work you won't do well in this class. He always tries to get your attention and make you learn different things. If you're only focused on getting the classes done without getting much more out of it, this is not your class."
11151,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP16401620,5.0,2.0,"Took two classes with him. When it comes to have fun he is funny, but make sure to do all the assignments. He will give you extra credit and more time to turn in your assignments but you have to, otherwise don't expect a grade you don't deserve."
11152,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,COMPI,5.0,1.0,very great and helpful. a lot of fun in the classes.
11153,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,EAP1640C23686,5.0,2.0,"Great professor, incredibly helpful with grammar techniques. Strongly recommend his class, I would take it again if I could."
11154,230861,James,May,Valencia College - East and West Campus,English,ENC1640,1.5,1.0,This guy is a joke.  He trys to over complicate everything with technology and forgets the fact that he is an Engrish teacher.  He should focus more on the course content and less with Apple products
11156,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211,5.0,4.0,"Yes she does give a lot of assignments but coming from someone who got an A, took another class during summer and worked full time: you can do it! Trust me that those assignments are for a reason, they helped me so much in exams. Also lectures were helpful and if you go with questions even better. Attendance and participation will help you trustme"
11157,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211,5.0,4.0,I took Dr. Sharma during summer of 2020 while in lockdown Since it was a summer class it was tough to learn all of the material that fast but she provided us with enough resources and practice material to get through it I attended almost all lectures and they definitely helped me as she explained all examples during class which helpedlotsin exams
11158,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2210C,1.0,5.0,Worst professor on campus
11159,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,Not warm or compassionate. Super hard.
11160,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,This class reminds me of slow death Toughest grader
11161,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,this professor wants to make your life difficult
11162,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,Does not care about students one bit. She knows how much homework she is giving and does not care that they are suffering. She is setting people up for failure. DO not ignore these reviews they are 100% true
11163,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2210,1.0,5.0,"She is the worst professor you can take for Orgo Chem! She always acts like she's so smart because everybody else in the world is dumb. Because of her class, my career GPA got ruined. Do not take her. She gives so much homework like you have no life and her homework doesn't prepare for anything. DO NOT TAKE!"
11164,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,No empathy towards students and the amount of work they are putting into the class.
11165,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2210C,1.0,5.0,"This professor assigned 3 or 4 lengthy homework assignments every week. Her exams were 14 pages long, and they were not fill in the blank or multiple choice. They were free response mostly. She takes off points for anything, and makes up reasons. Effort is not graded fairly in this class, you can do everything and she will not give you an A."
11166,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,Nothing about this class is amazing. Amazing would be to not take this professor.
11167,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2210,5.0,4.0,"AMAZING, it was online due to COVID but she made it as accessible and doable as possible. This is a HARD course in content and she bends backwards to help out."
11168,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,"Professor Sharma says she grades easily, but never does. This professor pretends to be easy but in reality, she is piling you with more work than 99% of professors. I don't understand this diplomatic persona she carries herself with. It's like she wants to get back at the world for something, and is taking it out on her students. I feel bad for all"
11169,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,"are you ready to take 2 hour exams that are 14 pages long and not multiplechoice? if so, sign up for this class. you will* regret it."
11170,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2210C,1.0,5.0,The reviews are 100% true. Do not turn a blind eye like I did. She is not only an impossible grader but also gives impossible exams and very little instruction. Taking the online version of this class was death. This class was the hardest I have ever worked for a C. She is completely unfair in the way she grades. My only advice is; RUN.
11171,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,Test instructions are one word &amp; don't make sense. She will make a mistake &amp; take points off of your work because of her mistake. She didn't teach us lab &amp; decided to give a lab practical worth more than exams. She didn't tell us about the final until the day before. Assignments from week 1 were not graded til after semester was over. She is rude.
11172,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,She grades nothing until the last day of class. Won't answer emails that are about her mistakes. Will test you on things you have never seen before. Will mark things wrong based on whether she likes the answer not if it is ACTUALLY correct (arrows look weirdits wrong). Will take points off for things she didn't even say to do. Rude to her students
11173,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2210C,3.0,5.0,"The Professor tries her best to help students through Remind to help with questions, but her practice tests give 0 clue as to what will be on the actual tests &amp; neither do her lectures or her two hw assignments a week. The tests are impossibly hard and she's a tough grader on assignments despite her ""easy"" rubric. I have never gotten lower than a B"
11174,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,"I've never worked so hard for such bad grades. I do the homework, study hours a week, and still the highest exam grade I've gotten is a 66."
11175,1513778,Vasudha,Sharma,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Chemistry,CHM2211C,1.0,5.0,She grades ridiculously tough. All of your grade come from tests and super time consuming assignments. Acts as though her class is the only one you're taking . This class just added to my complete disappointment in the Chemistry department.
11176,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,2.0,4.0,"Anthon is a strict grader and assigns a lot of work. She has weekly speeches that require hours of preparation and must be done with no mistakes. She has two group projects, including a little play as your final grade. For SPC1608, you're better off taking an easier, laidback professor. Speech is important, but not as important as she makes it."
11177,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,5.0,4.0,She is very tough but her class is so much fun and you will learn a lot.
11178,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1017,4.5,1.0,Linda Anthon is great professor. i like her class.
11179,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,4.0,3.0,"Professor Anthon, was pretty good. There is group work in the class. And she doesn't accept absences, even if you have a doctors note. The majority times you can be absent is 3. Its an easy A as long as you follow the instructions on how to do the outline. It's recommended you go to the writing center before you turn in your outline. Overall easy A"
11180,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,2.0,4.0,"Not the worst, but definitely not the best professor. She's an extremely tough grader, her system is very confusing; doesn't put in any of the grades, you are expected to keep track of all of it. Had quite a few speeches and a lot to do for each of them, and only about a week to prepare. She can also be rude and unfair, I wouldn't recommend her."
11181,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1101,5.0,4.0,"Shes a pretty strict teacher but i recommend her, She makes you do two big group projects which are very fun and worth a lot of points, If you dont do the Assignments you will fail,the class is based off outlines and speeches, but shes very good at giving lectures so it wont be hard if you pay attention. I definitely recommend her."
11182,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,4.5,2.0,Love her! This class is an easy A if you don't skip class and listen in class. She does give clear instructions. Some people are just negligent and like to blame her for things. I love giving speeches in her class. Only 2 group assignments. I really improved in public speaking after this class. A lot of extra credit opportunities.
11183,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1101,5.0,1.0,Absolutly glad i choose Her as my profesor ! Very lenient grader :) attendance is a must however I missed twice and just let her know beforehand. If You put in the work and do everything she ask You Will pass this class with an A. This class is as fun as You make it i made Alot of friends and got an A. Dont need the textbook no test.
11184,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,3.5,4.0,"That she is a tough teacher, and that you have to do everything her way. I think that she's not clear enough on the grading for the assignment. She has helped me get better with speaking."
11185,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,2.0,2.0,"She is a pretty nice lady, but she is very strict. Definitely does not like when students arrive late. She does give extra credits, also if you have no absence. Kind of a tough grader but as long as you do the outlines following her instructions, you will be fine. She is a good professor and gives extra credits, but she is kinda strict."
11186,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,4.5,2.0,"Honestly, as long as you do your work and have eveything she asks for it's an easy A.  There 1-2 test in the whole class, I used my book as refrence when writting my outlines and prepering for speeches other then that I didn't do the readings she assigned and still got an A in the class. she is a very nice lady and everything's in the syllabus. :)"
11187,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1017,4.0,2.0,She is so nice. All you have to do is participate a lot and she will like you. It is a lot of group work. You only have to do 4 speeches and they are fairly easy. Never gives tests and quizzes are easy if you read the main points in the chapters. She does have long lectures but her voice is so sweet. You can earn so much extra credit.
11188,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,1.5,4.0,"If you want an engaging professor, please save yourself and choose somebody else. You will sit there listening to the most boring stories, in a dull voice. She is conventional and simple minded, which makes class hard to sit through for me. She can be nice, but rude if you do something stupid. Overall she's a good person, but i wouldn't recommend."
11189,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,5.0,3.0,"Professor Anthon gives many extra credit opportunities. She also allows you to email her your work, so she can tell you what you need to do better. This professor is very helpful, I recommend her!"
11190,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1017,1.5,4.0,"She makes the class into some kind of hybrid speech and writing class. Prepare to do more speeches and writing assignments than what is necessary. She assigns reading assignments instead of actual homework covering the chapters. Also, she doesn't even provide a stapler for students to use. Do yourself a favor and take someone else."
11191,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1017,3.5,1.0,"Great professor, She is a sweet lady and very kind to her students. You have to read the text that she assigns, or else you might be kind of lost. Speeches are simple and you don't have to write them out, but there is a lot of busy work and Outlines. just be prepared to show up to class and write! And its an easy A!!"
11192,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC160820076,1.0,5.0,"I would not pick this professor. She does not use black board, because she doesn't agree with it. She can be very rude. also you will go the entire semester not knowing  your grade. Also don't ask questions in class. She will just tell you to read the syllabus.   Find a new professor. "
11193,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC,1.0,5.0,"The teacher is nice but it feels like she thinks her class is the only class everyone is taking. Way too much work for so little credits. Just the amount of work she made us do took away from how much fun the class could've actually been, she has some great ideas but poor ability to see how to interest students in speaking to an audience. "
11194,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1608,2.5,3.0,"if you're expecting an easy A, i wouldn't recommend her. She is a prude and she requires a lot of time spent doing what i would consider ""busy work"" she isn't a difficult professor however, she is an unpleasant one.  No  test, no quizzes. tardiness and absences will effect your grade greatly!!!"
11195,171660,Linda,Anthon,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Communication,SPC1602,4.5,2.0,"She's a very sweet lady and she makes the classes interesting. Never really felt the desire to skip her classes, and the speeches were easy to do because her classroom environment makes everyone feel very comfortable with each other. Highly recommend her."
11197,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,2.0,Professor Taylor is very nice and plus she cares about other students. The reason why Professor Taylor is very nice and caring is because I remember one year ago from today I remember having very a sad day and when I came to her classroom feeling very sad she I was explaining why I wasn't unable to finish Discussion4. She told me to come to her.
11198,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,LAT1120,5.0,4.0,"I had Dr. Taylor for 3 classes. Asian Humanities and Latin I and II. She is a wonderful teacher and absolute delight. She gives great feedback. But if you don't keep up with the readings and learn for your mistakes you will be left behind, well at least in Latin. In Asian Humanities it was an absolute breeze."
11199,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,"The assignments are mainly weekly quizzes, 3 unit tests, and occasionally some in class discussions. She mainly lectures during class using power points. The class overall is easy as long as you do the study guides she provides and take the quizzes. She's very passionate about about the material of the class and has a positive personality."
11200,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2410,5.0,4.0,"I love Doctor Taylor. She is extremely well informed on the ancient history of Asia. She discusses India, China, &amp; Japan in depth. I feel like I actually learned in her class. She mostly lectures at the front, shows some videos, and is willing to answer any questions you have. To pass the tests you NEED the book. She also has a fun food assignment."
11201,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,2.0,2.0,"I took her class online and she's quite forgetful. She would forget to post the modules each week and her calendar is kinda messy. Although, she gives good feedback. Also, be prepared to read notes if you want to pass this class."
11202,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1020,5.0,3.0,"Took this class online and as long as you stay on top of assignments you should have an A, very thoughtful and caring professor!"
11203,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,MYTH2310,3.0,4.0,Professor only gives tests and quizzes. No homework to fall back on. Pretty clear with info but wished she went into detail about some stories. If you read and pay attention you will do ok.
11204,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM1500,4.0,3.0,I loved Prof. Taylor. She is the most knowledgeable professor I have ever had. She really knows what shes teaching. I was a little upset because I received a high B in the class but thats just because I did not know we were having a test. I took her flex class which had 3 main tests and about 5 quizzes. Super easy. Just study her notes!
11205,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2410,5.0,3.0,She was really nice. You do have to study in order to pass so be ready to put the work in. There were a few quizzes and writing assignments she gave us 100%'s on for just turning it in which was awasome. She even let us take some of the quizzes at home was a big help sometimes. Shes really sweet and loves teaching on this subject.
11206,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HMYTH1,2.0,4.0,"If you're considering taking this class as an elective, don't waste your time. Professor Taylor has a snarky attitude, gives lots of verbal information but does not give detailed notes, which is not helpful if you're a visual learner. Tests are very specific and extremely hard. I am an A student, but I have had a very hard time passing this class."
11207,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2310,4.0,4.0,"Good class, actually learned things. Crazy, cool stories about lots of gods from all over the world. It's a lot to keep straight, but i love stories so it was fun for me."
11208,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2220,2.0,4.0,"Lectures are great and you learn a lot of materials. But every small detail is graded, especially in tests and essays. She does not grade easily. If you are looking for an ""easy A"" don't even bother. This course makes you work as much as you would in a math class."
11209,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2410,1.0,5.0,"This professor is a waste of time if you are wanting to take a Humanities class to get the credit out of the way. I hated having to do my essay on the spot during class for a grade, which what ever grade you get on the paper in class is your grade for the essay. Her notes are oral and so unclear."
11210,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2310,4.0,4.0,Fun class. Crazy stories of gods from all over the world. Challenging to keep them straight. Book has study guides in it that really help. Enjoyed it enough to take another class with prof.
11211,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2310,5.0,4.0,"Great professor. Really kind and helpful. I regularly visited during her office hours and she always helped me with anything I had trouble with in class.  It was challenging, but fun learning about so many gods and goddesses. She tells good stories. There are handouts for everything, both in Blackboard and at the end of each chapter. Very helpful!"
11212,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,MYTHOLOGY101,1.0,5.0,"Very nice and definitely knows her stuff, but she covers so much material too fast, and her quizzes and tests will be mostly questions that she does not cover. You will be expected to read chapters from the book she wrote and then take tests and quizzes knowing pretty much every detail. NO STUDY GUIDES. Do not take if you are taking other classes."
11213,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,MYTH101,2.0,5.0,"don't take this class as an elective you will regret it i promise you. this class requires as much work as your hardest major course. she doesn't know how to grade. ill give her one compliment and its ""she know her stuff."" annoying lecture. the assignments are bad and don't help with the work in class."
11214,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,HUM2310,3.0,4.0,"Definitely an expert in her field of Mythology and expects you to be also: definitely a tough grader. Not an easy ""A""- work is involved!!!"
11215,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,PSY101,4.0,1.0,"She is a good teacher, and if you study hard it is a easy class. You will have group presentation but not that hard and she will give you more than enough time to finish it.  She gives study guid and everything you need on her blackboard. My favorite teacher in this school."
11216,205533,Jennifer,Taylor,Valencia College - East and West Campus,Humanities,LAT1120,5.0,3.0,"Dr. Taylor is an excellent professor! She truly cares about her students and is always open to answering any questions one may have concerning her exams or homework assignments. The subject matter is definitely challenging at times; however, if you take notes and study diligently, you will do just fine in her class."
